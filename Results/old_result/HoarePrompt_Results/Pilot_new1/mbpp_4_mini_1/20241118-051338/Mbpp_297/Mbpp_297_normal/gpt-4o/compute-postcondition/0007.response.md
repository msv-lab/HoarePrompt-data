According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 items, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 item. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items. The `item` variable would need to be updated to reflect the next item in the list, which would be the second item. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, item is the second item in the list**
