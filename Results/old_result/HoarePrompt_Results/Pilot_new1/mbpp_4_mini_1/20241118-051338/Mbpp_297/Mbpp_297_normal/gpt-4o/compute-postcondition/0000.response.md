The code initializes `flat_list` as an empty list. The variable `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of both variables.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists; `flat_list` is an empty list**
