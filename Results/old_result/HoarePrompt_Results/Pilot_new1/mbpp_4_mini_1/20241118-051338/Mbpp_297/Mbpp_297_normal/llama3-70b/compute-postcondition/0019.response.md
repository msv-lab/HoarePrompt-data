Functionality: ** The function accepts a nested list `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other non-list elements, or further nested lists. It recursively flattens the list, returning a new list that contains all non-list elements from `nested_list`, preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, it returns an empty list. The function does not handle cases where `nested_list` contains non-list types other than the expected elements, but it will still return those elements in the flattened list. **
