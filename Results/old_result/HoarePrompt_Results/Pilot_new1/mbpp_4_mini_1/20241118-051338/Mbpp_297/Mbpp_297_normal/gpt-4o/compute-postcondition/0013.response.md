The code appends `item` (which is the third item in the list `nested_list`) to `flat_list`. The state of `flat_list` will change to include this new item, but the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`**
