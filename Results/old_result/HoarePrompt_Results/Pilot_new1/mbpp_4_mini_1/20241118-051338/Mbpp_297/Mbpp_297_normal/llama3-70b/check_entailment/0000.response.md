The provided program is designed to flatten a nested list structure. Let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should flatten a given nested list structure, returning a new list that contains all non-list elements from the nested list while preserving their order. If the nested list is empty, it should return an empty list.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for element in nested_list:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(element))
        else:
            flat_list.append(element)
    return flat_list
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a nested list `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other non-list elements, or further nested lists. It recursively flattens the list, returning a new list that contains all non-list elements from `nested_list`, preserving their order. If `nested_list` is empty, it returns an empty list. The function does not handle cases where `nested_list` contains non-list types other than the expected elements, but it will still return those elements in the flattened list.

### Initial Assessment:
- The code correctly identifies if an element is a list and recursively flattens it.
- It appends non-list elements to the `flat_list`, which aligns with the problem description.
- If the input is an empty list, the function will return an empty list, which is also correct.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty list**: The function handles this case correctly by returning an empty list.
2. **Nested lists with mixed types**: The function is designed to handle integers and other non-list elements, but there is a lack of explicit handling for unexpected types (like dictionaries, strings, etc.). However, according to the output hints, it will still return those elements in the flattened list, which means it does not fail but might not be the intended behavior based on the problem description.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints confirm the behavior of the function as described:
- The function does flatten the list and preserve order.
- It does return an empty list for an empty input.
- It does not explicitly handle non-list types, but it does include them in the output, which is a potential deviation from the strict interpretation of "flattening a nested list structure."

### Conclusion:
While the function works for many cases according to the problem description, the lack of handling for unexpected types (like dictionaries or strings) could lead to confusion about what the expected input types are. The output hints agree with the code, but they indicate that the function will include non-list types in the output without any checks, which could be seen as incorrect behavior depending on the strictness of the problem description.

Thus, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (i.e., it does not handle unexpected types explicitly), the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly address the potential case of handling unexpected non-list types, which could lead to outputs that are not in line with the expectations set by the problem description.
