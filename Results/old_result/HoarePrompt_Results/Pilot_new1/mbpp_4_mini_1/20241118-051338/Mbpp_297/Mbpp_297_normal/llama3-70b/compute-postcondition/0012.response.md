The `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(element)`, where `element` is the third element in the `nested_list`. The specific value of `element` is not provided, but it is known to exist as the third element in the `nested_list`. The state of `flat_list` is modified by adding the output of `func_1` applied to `element`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(element)`**.
