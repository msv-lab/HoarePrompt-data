The function accepts a list called `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists. It recursively flattens the list by extracting all non-list elements and the contents of any nested lists, returning a single flattened list containing all those elements. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
