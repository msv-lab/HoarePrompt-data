The code appends `element` to `flat_list`. Since `flat_list` is initially empty, it will now contain the value of `element`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` now contains `element`, and `element` is not a list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` now contains `element`, and `element` is not a list**
