Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element. If the first element `element` is a list, `flat_list` is updated with the result of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the first element `element`, which is not a list. In both cases, `flat_list` reflects the addition of either the flattened contents of `element` or the single `element` itself.***
