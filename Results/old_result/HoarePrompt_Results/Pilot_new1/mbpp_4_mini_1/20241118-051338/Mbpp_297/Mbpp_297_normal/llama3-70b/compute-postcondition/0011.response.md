According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements. The `element` variable will need to be updated to reflect the next element in the list, which will be the third element.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, element is the third element in the list.**
