Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the input list `nested_list`. If the item is a list, it calls itself to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it appends the item directly to `flat_list`. 

The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various cases, including nested lists of different depths and structures. Since the function handles all potential cases of nested lists, including empty lists, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
