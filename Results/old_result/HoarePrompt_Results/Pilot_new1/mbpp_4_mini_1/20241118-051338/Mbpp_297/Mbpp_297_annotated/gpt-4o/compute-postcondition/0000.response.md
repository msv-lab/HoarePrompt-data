The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `nested_list` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `flat_list` is an empty list while `nested_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both; `flat_list` is an empty list**
