The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` extends `flat_list` by appending the elements returned from `func_1(element)`. Here, `element` is the third element in `nested_list`, but we don't know the specific values of `flat_list` or the result of `func_1(element)`.

Since `flat_list` is being modified by adding elements to it, the output state will reflect the change in `flat_list`, but without knowing the specifics of `func_1` and the values in `flat_list`, we can only describe the change in a general way.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`**
