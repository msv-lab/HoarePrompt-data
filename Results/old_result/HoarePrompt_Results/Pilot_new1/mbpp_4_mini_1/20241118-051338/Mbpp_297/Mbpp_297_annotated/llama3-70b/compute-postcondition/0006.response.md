Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element. If the first element of `nested_list` (denoted as `element`) is a list, then `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(element)`. If `element` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains `element`. In both cases, `flat_list` will either include the contents of `element` if it is a list or just `element` itself if it is not, ensuring that `flat_list` reflects the structure of `nested_list`'s first element.***
