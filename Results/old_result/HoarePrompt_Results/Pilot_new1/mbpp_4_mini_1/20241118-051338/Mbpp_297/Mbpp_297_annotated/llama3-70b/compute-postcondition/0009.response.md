The code appends `element` to `flat_list`. Since `element` is the second element in `nested_list`, it will be added to `flat_list`. The initial state does not provide the specific values of `flat_list` or `element`, but it confirms that `flat_list` will have one additional item after execution. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element in the list, and `flat_list` has one additional element.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element in the list, and `flat_list` has one additional element**
