Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list. If `element` is a list, `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`. If `element` is not a list, `flat_list` now includes `element`. In both cases, `flat_list` is updated accordingly based on the type of `element`.***
