Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to flatten a nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle lists within lists, ensuring that all elements, regardless of their level of nesting, are included in the final flattened list. 

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Base Case**: If the input `nested_list` is empty, the program correctly initializes `flat_list` as an empty list and returns it, which meets the requirement of returning an empty list when there are no elements to flatten.

2. **Handling Non-List Elements**: The program correctly appends non-list elements to `flat_list`, ensuring that all integers (or other types of elements) are included in the final output.

3. **Recursion for Nested Lists**: When encountering a list, the program recursively calls `func_1` to flatten that list, then extends `flat_list` with the result. This ensures that any level of nested lists is handled appropriately.

4. **Final Output**: The final output is a single flattened list containing all elements from the original nested structure, as required by the problem description.

Since the program handles all potential cases as described, including empty lists and various levels of nesting, it is correct.
