According to the code, the loop iterates over each item in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least one more item beyond the current item being processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 items. The loop processes each item in `nested_list`, so if the current item is the last one, the loop will not execute again. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items, and the current item should be the second item in the list. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that the length of `nested_list` is at least 3.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items**
