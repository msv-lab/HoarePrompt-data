According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` contains at least one item, the loop can execute. Since `flat_list` is empty, it does not affect the loop execution. At the end of the last iteration, `flat_list` will still be empty if the loop has not executed yet. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, and `item` will be the first item in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first item in the nested_list**
