The code appends `item` to `flat_list`. Since `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`, it will be added to `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` and `flat_list` is not explicitly defined, but we know `nested_list` has at least 2 items. The output state reflects the change in `flat_list` as a result of the append operation. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items; `flat_list` now includes the second item from `nested_list`.**
