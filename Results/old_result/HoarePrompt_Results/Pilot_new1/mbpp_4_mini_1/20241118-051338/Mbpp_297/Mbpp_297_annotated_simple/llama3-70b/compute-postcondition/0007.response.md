According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 element, and the loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in `nested_list`. 

To execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, and `element` must be the second element in the list. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, element is the second element in the list**
