Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items. If the second item in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, if the second item is not a list, `flat_list` includes that second item directly. This covers the cases where the second item can either be a list or a non-list value.***
