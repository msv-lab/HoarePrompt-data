Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element. If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, then `flat_list` is extended with the output of `func_1` applied to that list. If the first element is not a list, then `flat_list` contains that element as its only item. This ensures that `flat_list` will either include the flattened contents of the first element if it is a list or the first element itself if it is an individual item.***
