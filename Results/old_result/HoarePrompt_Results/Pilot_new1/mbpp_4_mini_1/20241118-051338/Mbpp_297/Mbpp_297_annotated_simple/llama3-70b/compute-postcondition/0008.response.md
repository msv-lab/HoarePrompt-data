The code attempts to extend `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(element)`. The variable `element` is the second element in `nested_list`. The previous values of `flat_list` are not specified, but we know it will be modified by the `extend` method. The value of `func_1(element)` is unknown without further context about `func_1`, but it will return a list or iterable that will be added to `flat_list`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `nested_list`, `flat_list`, and the action taken.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element in the list, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(element)`**
