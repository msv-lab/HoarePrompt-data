According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one element. At the start of the loop, `element` will be the first element of `nested_list`. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are that `nested_list` must have at least one element, and `element` should be set to the first element of `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
