The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain integers or other lists. It recursively flattens the list, returning a single list `flat_list` containing all integers from `nested_list`, regardless of how deeply nested they are. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function does not handle non-integer types explicitly, so if non-integer types are present, they will be included in the flattened list as well.
