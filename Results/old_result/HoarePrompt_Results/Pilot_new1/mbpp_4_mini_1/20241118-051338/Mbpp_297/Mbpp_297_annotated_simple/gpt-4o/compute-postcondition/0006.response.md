Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` contains `item`. In both cases, `flat_list` will have either the elements from `item` if it is a list or just `item` itself if it is not, thus ensuring that `flat_list` is populated based on the type of `item`.***
