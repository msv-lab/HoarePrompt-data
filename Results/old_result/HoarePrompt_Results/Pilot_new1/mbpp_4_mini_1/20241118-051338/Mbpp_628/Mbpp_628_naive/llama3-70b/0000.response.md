Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The `str.replace()` method is used, which efficiently handles all occurrences of spaces in the input string. 

To verify correctness, consider various test cases:
1. Input: `"Hello World"` → Output: `"Hello%20World"`
2. Input: `"  Leading and trailing spaces  "` → Output: `"%20Leading%20and%20trailing%20spaces%20"`
3. Input: `""` (an empty string) → Output: `""`
4. Input: `"NoSpaces"` → Output: `"NoSpaces"`

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, replacing spaces with '%20'. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
