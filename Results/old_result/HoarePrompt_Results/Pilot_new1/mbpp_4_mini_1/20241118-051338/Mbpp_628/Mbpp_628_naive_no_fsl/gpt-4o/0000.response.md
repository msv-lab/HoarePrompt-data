Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20' using the `replace` method. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function works as expected for the tested cases:

1. For the input 'My Name is Dawood', it correctly returns 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'.
2. For the input 'I am a Programmer', it correctly returns 'I%20am%20a%20Programmer'.
3. For the input 'I love Coding', it correctly returns 'I%20love%20Coding'.

Additionally, the function should handle edge cases such as:
- An empty string, which should return an empty string.
- A string with no spaces, which should return the string unchanged.
- A string with leading or trailing spaces, which should also be handled correctly.

Since all potential cases seem to be correctly handled by the function, I conclude that the program is correct.
