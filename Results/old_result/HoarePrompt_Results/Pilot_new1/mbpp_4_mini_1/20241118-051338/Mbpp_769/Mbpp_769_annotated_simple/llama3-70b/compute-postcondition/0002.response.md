Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of the unique elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. This is accomplished by using the symmetric difference operation on the sets created from the two lists. The function effectively handles cases where the lists are empty or contain duplicate elements, ensuring that the output list contains only unique values. **
