The `diff_elements` is assigned the value of the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference will contain elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both. The values of `list1` and `list2` are not directly affected, but `set1` and `set2` are already derived from them. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `set1`, `set2`, and `diff_elements`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set of unique elements from `list1`, `list2` is a list containing elements of any type, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`**
