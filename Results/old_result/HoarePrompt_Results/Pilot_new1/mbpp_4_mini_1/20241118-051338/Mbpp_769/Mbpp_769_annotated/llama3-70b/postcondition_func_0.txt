The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, effectively calculating the symmetric difference of the two lists. It handles cases where the lists may contain duplicate elements, as duplicates are removed in the conversion to a set. The function does not handle cases where the input types are not lists or contain non-hashable elements, which could raise a TypeError.
