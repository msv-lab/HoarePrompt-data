The provided program attempts to get the difference between two lists by using the symmetric difference of sets. However, there is a flaw in the logic that can lead to incorrect results.

The symmetric difference operation finds elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. The result is then sorted based on the index of the elements in the combined list of both input lists. This approach can lead to incorrect ordering of elements in the result, especially when the same element appears in both lists but is not in the intersection.

For example, consider the following case:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3]) == [1, 4]
```

The expected result is `[1, 4]`, which is correct. However, if we take another case:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 2]) == [1, 4]
```

The expected result is still `[1, 4]`, which is correct. But the program does not handle cases where the order of elements in the input lists affects the outcome.

For instance:

```python
assert func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
```

This works as expected. However, consider the edge case:

```python
assert func_1([10, 15, 20, 25], [25, 20, 15, 40]) == [10, 40]
```

The expected output here is `[10, 40]`, but the logic of the program may not guarantee that the order is maintained correctly based on the indices of the elements in the combined list.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
