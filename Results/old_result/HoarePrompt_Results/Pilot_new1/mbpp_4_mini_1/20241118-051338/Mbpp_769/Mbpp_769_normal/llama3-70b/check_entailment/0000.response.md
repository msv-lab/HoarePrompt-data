Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description and the output hints.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to get the difference between two lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return sorted(list(set(list1) ^ set(list2)))
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, effectively computing the symmetric difference of the two lists. It handles cases where the lists may contain duplicate elements or be empty, ensuring the result is unique and sorted.

### Initial Assessment:
The program uses the symmetric difference operator (`^`) on two sets created from the input lists. This will indeed compute the unique elements present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The result is then sorted before being returned. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Lists:** If both lists are empty, the output should be an empty list, which the code handles correctly.
2. **Lists with Duplicates:** The use of `set` ensures that duplicates within each list are ignored, which is in line with the problem description.
3. **Identical Lists:** If both lists contain the same elements, the symmetric difference should return an empty list, which the code handles correctly.
4. **One List Empty:** If one list is empty, the output should be the sorted version of the non-empty list, which the code handles correctly.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior. They mention that the function computes the symmetric difference, which is exactly what the code does. The hints also correctly state that the result is unique and sorted, which is a result of using `set` and the `sorted` function.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the function correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. There are no identified edge cases where the function fails.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the symmetric difference of the two lists, handles empty lists and duplicates appropriately, and returns a sorted list of unique elements.
