The variable `set1` is assigned the value of `set(list1)`, which converts `list1` into a set, removing any duplicate elements. The state of `list2` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `set1` based on the elements of `list1`.

Output State: **`set1` is the set of unique elements from `list1`, `list2` remains unchanged**
