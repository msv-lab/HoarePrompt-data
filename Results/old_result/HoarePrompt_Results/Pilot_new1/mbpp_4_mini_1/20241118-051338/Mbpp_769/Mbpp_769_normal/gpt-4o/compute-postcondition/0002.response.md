The operation `set1.symmetric_difference(set2)` computes the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. This means it will create a new set containing elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both. The values of `set1` and `set2` are used to determine the result, while `list2` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new variable `diff_elements` that contains the symmetric difference.

Output State: **`set1` is the set of unique elements from `list1`, `list2` remains unchanged, `set2` is the set of unique elements from `list2`, and `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`**
