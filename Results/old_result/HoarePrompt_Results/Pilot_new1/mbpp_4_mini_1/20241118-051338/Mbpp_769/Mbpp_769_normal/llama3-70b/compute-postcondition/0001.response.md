The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists containing hashable elements. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of the symmetric difference of the two lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both.**
