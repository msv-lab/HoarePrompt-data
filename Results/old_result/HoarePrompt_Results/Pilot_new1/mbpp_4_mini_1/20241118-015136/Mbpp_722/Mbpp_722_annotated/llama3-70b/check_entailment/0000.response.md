To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description.

**Problem Description:**
The program should filter a dictionary of students based on their height and weight. Specifically, it should return a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to a specified minimum height and whose weight is greater than or equal to a specified minimum weight.

**Annotated Program:**
```python
def func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_data.items() 
            if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    # The program returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height 
    # and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Logic of the Code:** 
   - The function iterates over the `student_data` dictionary items.
   - It checks if each student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and if their weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the student is included in the returned dictionary.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where no students meet the criteria by returning an empty dictionary.
   - It also correctly includes students who meet or exceed the minimum height and weight.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations state that the function returns a dictionary of students whose height and weight meet the specified minimums. This aligns perfectly with the logic in the function.
   - There are no additional edge cases mentioned in the annotations that the function fails to cover.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not account for cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., if `student_data` is not a dictionary, or if the tuples do not contain valid float values). However, the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, so this is not a violation of the requirements.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no identified cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately filters the students based on the specified height and weight criteria as described in the problem statement. All potential cases considered (including the empty dictionary case) are handled appropriately by the implementation.
