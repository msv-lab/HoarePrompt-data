The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats representing the student's height and weight. The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight thresholds, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary containing the names of students and their corresponding (height, weight) tuples for those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter and return a dictionary of students who meet the specified height and weight criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary student_dict and two floats min_height and min_weight, and returns a dictionary of student names and their (height, weight) tuples for students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
