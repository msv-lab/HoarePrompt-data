Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` where the keys are student names and the values are tuples of (height, weight). It also accepts two float parameters, `min_height` and `min_weight`. The function returns a new dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet these criteria, an empty dictionary is returned. **
