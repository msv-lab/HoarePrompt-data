The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` where each key is a student's name and each value is a tuple containing their height and weight. It also accepts two integers, `min_height` and `min_weight`. The function returns a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with their names as keys and their (height, weight) tuples as values. If no students meet the criteria, an empty dictionary is returned.
