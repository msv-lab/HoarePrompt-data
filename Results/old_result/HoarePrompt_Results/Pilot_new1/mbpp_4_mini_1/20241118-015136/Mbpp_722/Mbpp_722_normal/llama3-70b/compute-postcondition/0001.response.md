The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_data` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats representing the student's height and weight. The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats that represent the minimum height and weight thresholds, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with student names as keys and their (height, weight) tuples as values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data and two float thresholds for height and weight, returning a filtered dictionary of students who meet or exceed these thresholds.**
