The value of `count` is incremented by 1, which means that the state of `count` changes, but the previous value of `count` is not specified. The other variables, including `j` and `nums`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `count` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` has increased by 1**
