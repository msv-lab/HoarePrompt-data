Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd. If the pair (nums[i], nums[j]) satisfies this condition, `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, ensuring that `j` is always valid as `i + 2`.***
