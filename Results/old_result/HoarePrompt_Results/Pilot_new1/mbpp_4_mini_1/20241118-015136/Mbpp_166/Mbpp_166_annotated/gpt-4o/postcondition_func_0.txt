The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the number of pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers in the list. It returns the total number of these pairs, which is the sum of even pairs and odd pairs. The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, but it will return 0 in that case, as there are no pairs to count.
