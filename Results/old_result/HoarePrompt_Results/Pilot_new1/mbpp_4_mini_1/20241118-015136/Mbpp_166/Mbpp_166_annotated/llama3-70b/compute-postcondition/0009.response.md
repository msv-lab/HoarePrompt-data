According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the list `nums`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and continues while `j` is less than `len(nums)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented to `i + 2` before the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to `i + 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables (`nums` and `count`) do not change in this context.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, j is `i + 2`**
