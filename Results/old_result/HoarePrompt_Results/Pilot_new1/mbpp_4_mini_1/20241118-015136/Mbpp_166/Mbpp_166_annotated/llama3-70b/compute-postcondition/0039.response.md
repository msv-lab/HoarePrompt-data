Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to `i + 1`, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity during any iteration of the loop, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
