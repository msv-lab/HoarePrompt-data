The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, and `count` is increased by 1**
