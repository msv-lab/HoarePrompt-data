According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop iterates over the range of `len(nums)`, which means it will execute for each index `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. The loop has completed for the last index `i`, which is `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `len(nums)`. 

Since the loop has already iterated through all indices, `i` would be equal to `len(nums)` after the last iteration. Therefore, to allow for another iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `len(nums)`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 1 to allow for the loop to execute once more. 

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is equal to len(nums), and `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 1.**
