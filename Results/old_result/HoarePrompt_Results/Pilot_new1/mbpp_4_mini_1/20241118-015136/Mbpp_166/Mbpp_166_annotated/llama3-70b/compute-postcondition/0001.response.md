According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration. Since `count` is not directly involved in the loop execution, it can remain as is. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nums` must be a list with at least 1 integer, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
