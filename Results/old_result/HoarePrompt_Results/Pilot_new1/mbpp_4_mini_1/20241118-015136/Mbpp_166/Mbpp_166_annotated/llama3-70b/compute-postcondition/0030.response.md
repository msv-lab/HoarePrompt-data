The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it will increase by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, and the integers nums[i] and nums[j] have the same parity (both even or both odd), and `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, and the integers nums[i] and nums[j] have the same parity (both even or both odd), and `count` is incremented by 1.**
