To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. 

### Code Analysis:
The provided function `func_1` iterates through all pairs of integers in the list `nums` and checks if the XOR of the two integers is even. The condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` will be true if both integers are either both even or both odd, since:
- Even XOR Even = Even
- Odd XOR Odd = Even
- Even XOR Odd = Odd

The function counts such pairs and returns the count.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations state that:
- The function returns the count of pairs where both integers are either both even or both odd.
- If the length of `nums` is less than or equal to 1, it returns 0 since no pairs can be formed.
- If no valid pairs exist, it returns 0.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Case with Mixed Parities**: If the list has mixed parities (both even and odd numbers), the function correctly identifies pairs that are both even or both odd. However, it fails to consider that the problem description specifically asks for pairs that XOR to an even number, which is satisfied by both even-even and odd-odd pairs.

2. **All Odd or All Even**: If the input list is all odd or all even, the function will return the correct count of pairs, as the XOR of any two odd numbers or any two even numbers will be even.

3. **Single Element**: If the list has only one element, the function correctly returns 0, as no pairs can be formed.

4. **Empty List**: If the list is empty, the function also correctly returns 0.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to count pairs that yield an even XOR result, and the annotations accurately describe the behavior of the code in various scenarios. 

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True** 

The function handles all edge cases correctly, and the annotations confirm that it accurately counts pairs of integers that XOR to an even number.
