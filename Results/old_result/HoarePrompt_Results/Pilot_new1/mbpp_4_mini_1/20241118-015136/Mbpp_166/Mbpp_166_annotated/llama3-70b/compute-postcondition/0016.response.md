Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is len(nums) - 1, `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 1, and the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, which means both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either both even or both odd.***
