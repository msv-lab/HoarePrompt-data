Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2. If the condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` holds true, then `count` is increased by 1, indicating that the pair (nums[i], nums[j]) consists of either two even integers or two odd integers.***
