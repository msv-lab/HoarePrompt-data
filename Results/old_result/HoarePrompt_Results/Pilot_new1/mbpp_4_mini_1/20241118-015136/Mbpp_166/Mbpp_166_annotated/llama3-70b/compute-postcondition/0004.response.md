The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `nums` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
