Output State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `count` is the number of pairs (i, j) where `i` is fixed and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. If `i` is greater than or equal to `len(nums) - 1`, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to `i + 1`, the loop also does not execute and `count` remains unchanged.**
