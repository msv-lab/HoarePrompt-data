According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop is set to iterate starting from `i + 1` up to `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be less than `len(nums)` for the loop to execute again.

Since it is stated that `len(nums)` remains unchanged, we need to ensure that `j` is adjusted accordingly. If `j` is currently equal to `len(nums) - 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `len(nums)`, which is out of bounds for the loop condition. Therefore, the only way for the loop to execute again is if `i` is adjusted such that `j` can be increased.

Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the provided state, we can infer that `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 2` to allow `j` to reach a valid index. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be `len(nums) - 2` or less. 

Additionally, since the loop starts from `i + 1`, we also need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to `i + 2` for the loop to continue functioning properly.

State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`**
