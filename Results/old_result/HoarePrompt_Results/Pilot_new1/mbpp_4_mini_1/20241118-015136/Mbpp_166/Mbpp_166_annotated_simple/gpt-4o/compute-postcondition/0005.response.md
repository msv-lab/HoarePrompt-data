The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from the count of even integers (`even_count`) and 2 odd integers from the count of odd integers (`odd_count`). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers and return the sum of combinations of choosing 2 even integers and 2 odd integers from that list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers and 2 odd integers from the list.**
