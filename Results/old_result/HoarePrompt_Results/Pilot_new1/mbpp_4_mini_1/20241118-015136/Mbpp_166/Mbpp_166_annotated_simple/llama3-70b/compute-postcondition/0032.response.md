According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(nums) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, which means that `j` can take on values from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be equal to `i + 1` and ensure that `i` remains the same, as it is not incremented in this loop.

Since the state mentions that `len(nums)` remains unchanged, we do not need to adjust that. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` will now be `i + 1`, and we must ensure that `j` is less than `len(nums)`.

State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`**
