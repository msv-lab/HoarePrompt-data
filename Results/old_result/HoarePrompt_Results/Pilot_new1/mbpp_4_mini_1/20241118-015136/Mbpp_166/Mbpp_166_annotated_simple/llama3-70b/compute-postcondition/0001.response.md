According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, as it will take values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. 

So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 integer, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
