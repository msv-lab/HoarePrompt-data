According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop starts at `i + 1` and continues until `len(nums)`, so for the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `len(nums)`. This means that `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Given that `i` is currently set to `len(nums)`, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `len(nums) - 1` or lower. 

Additionally, since `j` starts at `i + 1`, we can infer that `j` will be `len(nums)` at the start of the loop, but for the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`, which is not the case if `i` remains `len(nums)`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`len(nums)` is unchanged, `count` is unchanged, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1, j is len(nums)`**
