According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 3`. Additionally, `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 3` to ensure that the loop can continue. 

Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, we can assume that `len(nums)` is at least 2. However, to execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 4 integers, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 3`**
