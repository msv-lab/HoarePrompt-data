The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1**
