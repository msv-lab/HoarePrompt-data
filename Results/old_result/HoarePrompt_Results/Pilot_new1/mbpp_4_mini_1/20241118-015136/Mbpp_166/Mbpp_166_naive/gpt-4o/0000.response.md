To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem description:** Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum((1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0))
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
```

### Analysis:
- The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd.
- The program counts the number of even integers and odd integers in the list.
- It then calculates the number of pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers using the formula for combinations (n choose 2), which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.

### Testing the logic:
1. **Even pairs:** For `even_count`, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from the total even numbers.
2. **Odd pairs:** Similarly, for `odd_count`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers.

### Example Cases:
- For the input `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]`:
  - Even numbers: `[4, 2]` (2 even numbers) → pairs = 1
  - Odd numbers: `[5, 7, 1]` (3 odd numbers) → pairs = 3
  - Total pairs = 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)

- For the input `[7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]`:
  - Even numbers: `[2, 8, 0]` (3 even numbers) → pairs = 3
  - Odd numbers: `[7, 1, 5, 11]` (4 odd numbers) → pairs = 6
  - Total pairs = 3 + 6 = 9 (Correct)

- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`:
  - Even numbers: `[2]` (1 even number) → pairs = 0
  - Odd numbers: `[1, 3]` (2 odd numbers) → pairs = 1
  - Total pairs = 0 + 1 = 1 (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- If the list is empty `[]`, there are 0 pairs → Correct.
- If the list contains only one element `[1]`, there are 0 pairs → Correct.
- If the list contains two even numbers `[2, 4]`, there is 1 pair → Correct.
- If the list contains two odd numbers `[1, 3]`, there is 1 pair → Correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers that XOR to an even number across all tested cases and edge cases. There are no identified edge cases where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
