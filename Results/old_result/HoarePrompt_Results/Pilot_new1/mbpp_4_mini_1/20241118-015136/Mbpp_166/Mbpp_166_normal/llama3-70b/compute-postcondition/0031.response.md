Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even (indicating that both numbers have the same parity), then `count` is increased by 1. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have different parities, then `count` remains unchanged. The length of `nums` is at least 2, and `i` and `j` are the indices of the last two elements in the list.***
