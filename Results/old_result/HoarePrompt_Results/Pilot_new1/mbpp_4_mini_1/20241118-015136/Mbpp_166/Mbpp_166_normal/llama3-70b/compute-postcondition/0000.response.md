The variable `count` is assigned the value `0`, but the initial state does not provide any specific values for the list `nums`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 0**
