The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it calculates the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `even_count` and 2 odd integers from `odd_count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return the sum of the combinations of choosing 2 even integers and 2 odd integers from the respective counts of even and odd integers in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers lst and returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers and 2 odd integers from the counts of even and odd integers in the list.**
