Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd. If `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This means that `count` accurately reflects the number of valid pairs based on the parity of the elements in `nums`.***
