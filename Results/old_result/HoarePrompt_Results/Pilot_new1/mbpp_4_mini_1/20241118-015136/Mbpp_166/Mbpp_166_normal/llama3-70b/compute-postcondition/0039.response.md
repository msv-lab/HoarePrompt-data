Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd. If `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop executes for each valid `j` index, incrementing `count` when `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (i.e., `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`). If `len(nums)` is exactly `i + 1`, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is less than 2, it is invalid based on the initial state, but if it were to be the case, `count` would still be unchanged and the loop would not execute.**
