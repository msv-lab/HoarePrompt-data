According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `len(nums)`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which means `j` will be initialized to 1 (since `i` is 0) before the first iteration. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Given that `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `len(nums)` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1 to ensure that `j` can be less than `len(nums)` during the first iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `count` is still 0 because the loop body is omitted. Thus, the required states are that `nums` must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 0, and `j` is initialized to 1.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
