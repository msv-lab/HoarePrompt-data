Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, and `j` is `i + 2`. If `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, it is guaranteed that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, ensuring that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are valid indices.***
