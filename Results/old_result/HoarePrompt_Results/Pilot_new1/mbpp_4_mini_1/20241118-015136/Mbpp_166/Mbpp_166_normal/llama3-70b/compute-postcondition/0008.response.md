Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is incremented by 1 if the result of the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, which occurs when both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either even or odd, resulting in `count` being 2 in this case. If the condition is not met, `count` remains 1.***
