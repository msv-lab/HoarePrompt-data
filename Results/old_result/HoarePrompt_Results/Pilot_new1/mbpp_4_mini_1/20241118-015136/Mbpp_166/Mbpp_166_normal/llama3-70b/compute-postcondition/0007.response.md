The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `count` is 1, after executing the code, `count` will be 2. The values of `nums` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 2, `j` is `i + 2`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 2, `j` is `i + 2**
