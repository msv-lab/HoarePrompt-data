Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being 3. If the XOR is odd, `count` remains 2. The relationship between `i` and `j` is maintained, with `j` being `i + 2`.***
