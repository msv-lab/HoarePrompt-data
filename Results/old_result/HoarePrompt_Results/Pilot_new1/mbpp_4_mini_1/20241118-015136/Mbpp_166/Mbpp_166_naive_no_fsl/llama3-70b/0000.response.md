To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` in relation to the problem description, which requires counting pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Understanding XOR and Evenness:
1. The XOR operation between two integers results in an even number if both integers are either even or both are odd. This is because:
   - Even XOR Even = Even
   - Odd XOR Odd = Even
   - Even XOR Odd = Odd

### Analyzing the Code:
The code iterates over all unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and checks if the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. If it is, it increments the count.

### Case Analysis:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the function behaves as expected:

1. **Test Case 1:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)
   - XORs: 3 (odd), 2 (even), 5 (odd), 1 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd)
   - Even pairs: (1,2), (2,4) â†’ Count = 2

2. **Test Case 2:** `nums = [1, 1, 1]`
   - Pairs: (1,1), (1,1)
   - XORs: 0 (even), 0 (even)
   - Count = 2 (since there are two pairs of (1,1))

3. **Test Case 3:** `nums = [2, 4, 6]`
   - Pairs: (2,4), (2,6), (4,6)
   - XORs: 6 (even), 4 (even), 2 (even)
   - Count = 3

4. **Test Case 4:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)
   - XORs: 3 (odd), 2 (even), 1 (odd)
   - Count = 1

### Conclusion:
The function correctly counts pairs of integers whose XOR is even. It handles all tested cases correctly and adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately counts the pairs of integers in the list that XOR to an even number, considering all necessary conditions.
