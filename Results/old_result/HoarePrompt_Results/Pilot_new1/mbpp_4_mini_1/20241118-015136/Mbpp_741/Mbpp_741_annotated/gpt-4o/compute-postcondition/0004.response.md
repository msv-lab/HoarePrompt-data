According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return True. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, `first_char` is the first character of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must not be empty, and `first_char` should be the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
