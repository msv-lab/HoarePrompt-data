Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. 

1. If the string is empty (`not s`), it returns `True`, which is appropriate since an empty string can be considered to have all the same characters (since there are none).
2. It assigns the first character of the string to `first_char` and iterates through each character in the string. If it finds any character that does not match `first_char`, it returns `False`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding any differing characters, it returns `True`, indicating all characters in the string are the same.

The provided assertions also confirm the correctness of the function for the tested cases:
- `func_1('python')` returns `False` (not all characters are the same).
- `func_1('aaa')` returns `True` (all characters are the same).
- `func_1('data')` returns `False` (not all characters are the same).

No edge cases are missed, and the logic is sound for all potential inputs. Thus, the function meets the problem description requirements.
