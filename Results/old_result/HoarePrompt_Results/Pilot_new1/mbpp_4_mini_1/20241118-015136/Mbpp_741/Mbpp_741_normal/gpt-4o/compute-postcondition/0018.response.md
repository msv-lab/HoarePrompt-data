Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is empty. If `s` is a non-empty string, it checks if all characters in `s` are the same as the first character; it returns `False` if any character differs. However, if all characters are the same, the function implicitly returns `None`, which is not handled in the annotations. Therefore, the function can return `True`, `False`, or implicitly return `None`. **
