According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the second character of `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `char` is updated to the next character in the string `s`. Since `char` is currently the second character, for the loop to execute again, we need `char` to be the third character in the string. Therefore, `s` must still be a non-empty string, and we need to adjust `char` to be the third character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`**
