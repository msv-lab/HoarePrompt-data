According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string and `first_char` is the first character of `s`, we know that the loop has processed at least one character already.

At the end of the last iteration, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` was equal to `first_char`, meaning the loop did not return anything and continued. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be the next character in the string `s`.

If the loop has already processed the first character, then `char` should now be the second character of `s`, and the loop will continue until all characters in `s` have been processed.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `char` should be the second character of `s`.
- The iteration index (implicit) should be updated to reflect that we are now at the second character.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
