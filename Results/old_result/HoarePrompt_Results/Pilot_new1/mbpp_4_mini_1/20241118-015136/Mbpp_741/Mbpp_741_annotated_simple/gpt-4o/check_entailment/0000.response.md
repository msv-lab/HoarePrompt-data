To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True
```

### Logic Breakdown
1. **Empty String Check**: 
   - The first `if` statement checks if the string `s` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`. This behavior is consistent with the idea that an empty string can be considered to have "all characters the same" since there are no characters to compare.
   
2. **Character Comparison**:
   - If `s` is not empty, the first character is stored in `first_char`.
   - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. If any character differs from `first_char`, the function returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, the function returns `True`.

### Edge Cases
- The program correctly handles the empty string case by returning `True`.
- For non-empty strings, it checks if all characters are the same and returns `False` if any character is different.

### Potential Case for Incorrectness
However, the program has a flaw when it comes to single-character strings. Although it correctly identifies that a string with a single character (e.g., `"a"`) should return `True`, the logic is sound. 

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering various cases including empty strings, single-character strings, and multi-character strings, I find that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. 

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly identifies whether all characters in the string are the same for all potential input cases.
