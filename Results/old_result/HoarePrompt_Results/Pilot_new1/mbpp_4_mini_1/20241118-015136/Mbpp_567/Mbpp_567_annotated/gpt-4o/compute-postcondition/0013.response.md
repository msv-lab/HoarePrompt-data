The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. 

- Case 1: If `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, it checks if each element is less than or equal to the next. If any element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `False`. If `lst` is empty or contains only one element, the function does not return anything and indicates that `lst` is unchanged.
  
- Case 2: If all elements are in non-decreasing order, the program returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and check if it is sorted in non-decreasing order, returning `True` if it is, `False` if it is not, and not returning anything if the list is empty or has only one element. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, returns `False` if it is not, and does not return anything if the list is empty or has only one element.**
