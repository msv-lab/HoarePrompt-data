The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. 

- Case 1: If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the function checks if each element is greater than the next one. If any element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `False`. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns `None`. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function also implicitly returns `None`.

- Case 2: If none of the conditions in Case 1 are satisfied (meaning all elements are in non-decreasing order), the program returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and return `False` if any element is greater than the next one when there are at least 2 elements. If `lst` has less than 2 elements or all elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns `None` or `True` respectively.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns `False` if any element is greater than the next one when there are at least 2 elements; returns `None` if lst has less than 2 elements or if the elements are in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `True`.**
