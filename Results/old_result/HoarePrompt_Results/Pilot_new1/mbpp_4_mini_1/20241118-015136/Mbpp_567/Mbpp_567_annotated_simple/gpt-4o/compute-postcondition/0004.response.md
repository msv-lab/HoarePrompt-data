According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `lst`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst` has at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. The length of `lst` does not need to change, as it already has at least 2 elements, allowing for further iterations.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
