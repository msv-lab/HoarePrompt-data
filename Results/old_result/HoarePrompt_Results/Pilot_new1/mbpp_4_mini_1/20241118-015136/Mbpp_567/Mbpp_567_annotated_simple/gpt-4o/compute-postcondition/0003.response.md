Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `lst` is greater than the second element, the function returns False. If the first element is less than or equal to the second element, the function does not return anything, which implies that the comparison does not lead to a False outcome.***
