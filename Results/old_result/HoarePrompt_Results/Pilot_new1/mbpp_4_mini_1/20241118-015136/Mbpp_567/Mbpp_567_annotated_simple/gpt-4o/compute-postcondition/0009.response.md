Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements and `i` is 2. If the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the function does not return anything, and thus the execution continues beyond this point.***
