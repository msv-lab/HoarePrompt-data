The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements that can be of any type, and `element` can also be of any type. 

In Case_1, if `arr` is a non-empty list, the function checks each element against `element`. If a match is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the matching element. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function does not return any value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no values are returned.

In Case_2, the function returns `False` and -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and it returns `True` and the index of the matching element if a match is found; if no match is found in a non-empty list, it returns no value; if the list is empty, it also returns no value; and in another case, it returns `False` and -1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`, returns `True` and the index of the matching element if a match is found. If no match is found in a non-empty list, it returns no value; if the list is empty, it returns no value; in another case, it returns `False` and -1.**
