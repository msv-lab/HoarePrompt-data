To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function should take an array and an element, returning a tuple:
1. A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
2. The index position of the element if found, or -1 if not found.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, elem):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == elem:
            return True, i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `arr` is a list with at least one element and `elem` is equal to one of its elements, the loop will return True and the index of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `arr` is a list with at least one element and `elem` is not present, the loop will finish without returning, and the state remains unchanged. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and there is no return value, leaving the state unchanged.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The function uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to go through each element in the list `arr`. 
2. If it finds an element `x` that matches `elem`, it returns `True` and the index `i`.
3. If the loop completes without finding `elem`, it correctly returns `False` and `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function correctly returns `False, -1`.
- **Element Present**: If the element is in the list, it returns `True` and the correct index.
- **Element Not Present**: If the element is not in the list, it returns `False` and `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all potential cases correctly as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
