Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least three elements, `value` is the third element of the list, and `index` is 2. If `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the index value of 2. If `value` is not equal to `element`, the function does not return any value, and the state remains unchanged.***
