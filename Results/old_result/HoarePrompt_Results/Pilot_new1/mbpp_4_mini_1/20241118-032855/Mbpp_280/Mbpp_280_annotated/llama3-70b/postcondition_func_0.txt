The function accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`. It checks if `elem` is present in `arr`. If `elem` is found, it returns `True` and the index of `elem`. If `elem` is not found, it returns `False` and -1. If `arr` is empty, it directly returns `False` and -1 as well. The function does not return any value if `elem` is not found during the iteration, which is a logical inconsistency in the annotations.
