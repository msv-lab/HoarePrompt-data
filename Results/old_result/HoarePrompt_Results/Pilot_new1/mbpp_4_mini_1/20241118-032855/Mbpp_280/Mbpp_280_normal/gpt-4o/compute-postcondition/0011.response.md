Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one element and if any element is equal to `element`, the function returns True along with the index of the first occurrence of `element`. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute and the function does not return any value. If no elements in `arr` are equal to `element`, the loop will execute for all elements without returning, indicating that the condition was not met.**
