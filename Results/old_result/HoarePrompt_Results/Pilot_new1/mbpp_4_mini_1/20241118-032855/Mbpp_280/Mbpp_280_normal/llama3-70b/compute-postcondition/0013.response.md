The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `elem`. `arr` is a list of elements, and `elem` is an element that can be of any type. 

In Case_1, if `arr` contains at least one element and `elem` is equal to an element in `arr`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `arr` is empty, the function does not execute the loop and does not return any value. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function executes the loop for all elements without returning a value, leaving the state unchanged.

In Case_2, if `arr` does not contain `elem`, the function returns `False` and -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, and return `True` with the index of `elem` if found; if `arr` is empty or `elem` is not found, it returns `False` and -1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`, returns `True` and the index of `elem` if found in `arr`; if `arr` is empty or `elem` is not found, it returns `False` and -1.**
