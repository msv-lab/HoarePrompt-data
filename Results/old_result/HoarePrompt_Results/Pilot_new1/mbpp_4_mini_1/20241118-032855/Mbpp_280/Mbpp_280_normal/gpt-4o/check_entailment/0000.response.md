To analyze the provided program and determine its correctness, let's break it down step by step.

### Problem Description
The function should take an array and an element, returning a tuple containing:
- A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
- The index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)
```

### Initial Assessment
1. The program iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value.
2. If the value matches the element, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty Array**: If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and it correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
- **Element Not Present**: The function should correctly return `(False, -1)` if the element is not in the array.
- **Multiple Occurrences**: The function returns the index of the first occurrence, which aligns with the requirement.

### Output Hints
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`.
- It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`.
- If found, it returns `True` and the index of that element; if not found, it returns `False` and -1.
- If `arr` is empty, it also returns `False` and -1, as the loop does not execute.

### Agreement Between Code and Output Hints
The output hints accurately describe the behavior of the code. The hints mention that the function returns `False` and -1 for an empty array, which is indeed handled correctly by the code.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description for every potential case:
- It correctly returns `(True, index)` when the element is found.
- It returns `(False, -1)` when the element is not found or the array is empty.

There are no edge cases where the program fails to meet the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
