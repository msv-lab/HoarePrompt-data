According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `arr` is a list with at least two elements. This means the length of `arr` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `x` should be the third element of `arr`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.
- `x` should be updated to the third element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `arr`**
