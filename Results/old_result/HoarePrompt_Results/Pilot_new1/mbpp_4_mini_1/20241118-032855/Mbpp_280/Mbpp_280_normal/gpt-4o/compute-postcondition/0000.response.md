According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `index` should be 0, and `value` should be the first element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and the initial states should be set accordingly.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, index is 0, value is the first element in the list**
