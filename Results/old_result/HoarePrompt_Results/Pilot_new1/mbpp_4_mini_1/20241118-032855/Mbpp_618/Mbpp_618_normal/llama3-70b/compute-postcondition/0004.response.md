The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and they are of the same length. After executing the function body, it returns a list that contains the results of dividing corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers of the same length and return a new list containing the results of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, which are lists of numbers of the same length, and returns a list of the results of dividing corresponding elements of list1 by list2.**
