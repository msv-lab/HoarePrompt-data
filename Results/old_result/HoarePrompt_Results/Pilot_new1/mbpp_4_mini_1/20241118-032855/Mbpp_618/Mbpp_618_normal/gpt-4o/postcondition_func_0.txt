The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a list containing the results of element-wise division of corresponding elements from `list1` by `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, the function may raise an error if division by zero is attempted.
