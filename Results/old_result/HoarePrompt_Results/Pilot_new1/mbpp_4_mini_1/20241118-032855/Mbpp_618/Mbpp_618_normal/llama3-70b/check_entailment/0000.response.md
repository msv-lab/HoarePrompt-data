To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we start by analyzing the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** The task is to divide two lists element-wise. Both lists must be of the same length, and if they are not, a ValueError should be raised. The function should return a new list containing the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        raise ValueError('Both lists must be of the same length')
    return [x / y for (x, y) in zip(list1, list2)]
```

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The function checks if the lengths of the two lists are equal and raises a ValueError if they are not. This part aligns with the problem description.
2. The function uses a list comprehension with `zip` to iterate over both lists and performs element-wise division. 

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. If `list2` contains any zeros, the division will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. The problem description does not mention how to handle zeros in `list2`.
2. If either list is empty, the function will not raise an error but will return an empty list, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description.

Now, let's evaluate the output hints.

**Output hints:** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, which must be of the same length. It raises a ValueError if the lengths are not equal. If they are equal, the function returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, this will raise a ZeroDivisionError during the division operation.

**Agreement with Output Hints:**
- The output hints correctly indicate that a ValueError is raised for unequal lengths.
- They also correctly mention that a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur if any element in `list2` is zero, which is indeed a valid case that the code does not handle.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program does not handle the case where `list2` contains zeros, and the problem description does not specify how to manage this scenario, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code is incorrect because it fails to address the case where any element in `list2` is zero, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`.
