The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and are of the same length. It is guaranteed that no element in `list2` is zero. After executing the function body, it returns a list that contains the element-wise division of the numbers in `list1` by the corresponding numbers in `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers and return a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of `list1` by `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, list1 and list2, and returns a list containing the element-wise division of the numbers in list1 by the corresponding numbers in list2.**
