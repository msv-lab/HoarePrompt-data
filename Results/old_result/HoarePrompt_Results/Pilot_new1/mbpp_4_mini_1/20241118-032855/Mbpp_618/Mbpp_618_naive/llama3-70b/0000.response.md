Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where any element in `list2` is zero. Dividing by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is not accounted for in the code. For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 0, 3]`, the program will attempt to perform the division `2 / 0`, leading to an error. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of safely dividing the two lists element-wise for all potential cases.
