Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where division by zero might occur. If `list2` contains a zero, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. For example, calling `func_1([4, 5, 6], [1, 0, 3])` would result in an error, which means it does not fulfill the requirements of dividing two lists element-wise for all potential inputs.
