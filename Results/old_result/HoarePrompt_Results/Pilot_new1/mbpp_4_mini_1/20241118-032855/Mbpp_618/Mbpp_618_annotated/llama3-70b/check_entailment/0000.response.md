Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where any element in `list2` is zero. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of numbers resulting from the element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, this will result in a ZeroDivisionError, which is not addressed in the implementation. The annotations mention this potential issue, indicating that the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError if an attempt is made to divide by zero, which means the function does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 0, 6]`, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError during the division operation, which is not an expected behavior based on the problem description. Thus, the function fails to handle this edge case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
