Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found. If `first_index` is -1 (indicating `ch` is not found in `s`), or `last_index` is -1 (indicating `ch` is not found in `s`), or if `first_index` equals `last_index` (indicating `ch` appears only once), the function returns `s` unchanged. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
