The variable `first_occ` is assigned the value of `s.find(c)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is present in `s`, `first_occ` will hold the index of that occurrence; if `c` is not present, `first_occ` will be `-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, and `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, and `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or `-1**
