To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, we will analyze the code and its behavior with various inputs.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character `c` from a string `s`.

### Annotated Program:
The function `func_1(s, c)`:
1. Finds the index of the first occurrence of `c` using `s.find(c)`.
2. Finds the index of the last occurrence of `c` using `s.rfind(c)`.
3. If both occurrences are found (i.e., both indices are not -1), it constructs a new string that excludes these occurrences.
4. If either occurrence is not found, it returns the original string `s`.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Normal Case**: If `c` appears multiple times in `s`, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.
   - Example: For `s = "banana"` and `c = "a"`, the function will return `"ban"` (removes the first and last "a").
   
2. **Single Occurrence**: If `c` appears only once in `s`, the function will return the original string.
   - Example: For `s = "apple"` and `c = "a"`, the function will return `"apple"` (only one "a" exists).

3. **No Occurrence**: If `c` does not exist in `s`, the function returns the original string.
   - Example: For `s = "orange"` and `c = "b"`, the function will return `"orange"`.

4. **Edge Case**: If `s` is empty or consists of the character `c` alone, the function should return an empty string or an empty result, respectively.
   - Example: For `s = ""` and `c = "a"`, it returns `""`.
   - Example: For `s = "a"` and `c = "a"`, it returns `""` (removes the only occurrence).

### Potential Issues:
- The function does not handle the case where `s` consists of only the character `c` multiple times correctly. For instance:
   - For `s = "aaa"` and `c = "a"`, the expected output is `""` (removing the first and last "a"), and this is indeed what the function returns.
   - However, if `s` contains only one character `c`, it should return an empty string as well, which is handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases outlined above. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected under various scenarios. Since there are no identified edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
