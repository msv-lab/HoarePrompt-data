To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found. If `first_index` is -1 (indicating `ch` is not found in `s`), or `last_index` is -1 (indicating `ch` is not found in `s`), or if `first_index` equals `last_index` (indicating `ch` appears only once), the function returns `s` unchanged. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns the string 's' with the character 'ch' removed from both its first and last occurrences
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns `s` unchanged if `ch` is not found in `s`, appears only once, or if `ch` is an empty string. Otherwise, it removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s` and returns the modified string.
```

### Analysis:
1. **Handling of `ch` not found**: If `ch` is not found in `s`, the function correctly returns `s`, which matches the requirement.
2. **Handling of single occurrence**: If `ch` appears only once, the function again correctly returns `s`, which is what the problem description requires.
3. **Handling of multiple occurrences**: The function should remove the first and last occurrences of `ch` when there are multiple occurrences. The slicing logic used (`s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]`) appears to be correct for this purpose.

### Edge Cases:
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `ch` is an empty string. According to the annotations, it states that if `ch` is an empty string, the function would return `s` unchanged. However, the code does not check for this case explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior if an empty string is passed as `ch`.
- The annotations mention that if `ch` is an empty string, the function should return `s` unchanged, but this is not enforced in the code.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `ch` is an empty string, which is a valid input scenario that the problem description does not account for. Because of this missing logic, the function does not adhere to the problem requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

The annotations influenced my reasoning, as they indicated that the function would return `s` unchanged for an empty `ch`, but the code does not enforce this check, leading to a potential failure.
