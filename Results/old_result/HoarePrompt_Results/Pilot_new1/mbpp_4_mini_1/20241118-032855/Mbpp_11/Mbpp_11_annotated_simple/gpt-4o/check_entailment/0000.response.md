To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

1. **Finding the Indices**:
   - `first_index = s.find(ch)` finds the first occurrence of `ch`.
   - `last_index = s.rfind(ch)` finds the last occurrence of `ch`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The condition `if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index)` checks for three scenarios:
     - If `ch` is not found at all (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`).
     - If `ch` appears only once in the string (`first_index == last_index`).
   - In any of these cases, the function returns the original string `s`.

3. **Removing Characters**:
   - If both indices are valid and different, the function constructs a new string by:
     - Taking the substring before the first occurrence of `ch`.
     - Taking the substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding the first occurrence).
     - Taking the substring after the last occurrence of `ch`.

### Potential Case to Test:
Let's consider the string `s = "abcde"` and `ch = "a"`.
- Here, the first occurrence of `ch` is at index 0 and the last occurrence is also at index 0.
- According to the logic, since `first_index` equals `last_index`, the function will return the original string `s`, which is `"abcde"`. This is correct as there is only one occurrence.

Now consider the string `s = "banana"` and `ch = "a"`.
- The first occurrence of `ch` is at index 1 and the last occurrence is at index 4.
- The function will return `s[:1] + s[1 + 1:4] + s[4 + 1:]`, which results in `bnn`. This correctly removes both occurrences of `a`.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Now, let's analyze the case where `s = "a"` and `ch = "a"`.
- Here, `first_index` is 0 and `last_index` is also 0.
- According to the logic, the function will return the original string `s`, which is `"a"`. This is incorrect because we should remove the only occurrence of `a`, resulting in an empty string `""`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the string consists of a single character that matches `ch`. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
