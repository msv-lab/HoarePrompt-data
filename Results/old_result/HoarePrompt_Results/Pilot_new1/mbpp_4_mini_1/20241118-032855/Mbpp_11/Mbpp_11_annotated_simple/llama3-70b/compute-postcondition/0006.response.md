Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a single character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns the string `s` unchanged. This covers the case where `c` is not present in `s`, as well as the case where `c` appears only once, resulting in no change to the string.***
