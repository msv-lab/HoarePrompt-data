To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program:

**Problem description:** Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s, c):
    first_occ = s.find(c)
    last_occ = s.rfind(c)
    if first_occ != -1 and last_occ != -1:
        return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

**Analysis:**

1. The function uses `s.find(c)` to locate the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is not found, `first_occ` will be `-1`.
2. It uses `s.rfind(c)` to find the last occurrence of the character `c`. If `c` is not found, `last_occ` will also be `-1`.
3. If both occurrences are found (i.e., `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not `-1`), it constructs a new string by:
   - Taking the substring before the first occurrence (`s[:first_occ]`).
   - Taking the substring between the first and last occurrences, excluding the first occurrence (`s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]`).
   - Taking the substring after the last occurrence (`s[last_occ + 1:]`).
4. If either occurrence is not found, it simply returns the original string `s`.

**Potential Case:**
- Consider the input `s = "abcabc"` and `c = "a"`. The expected output should be `"bc"` because the first 'a' at index 0 and the last 'a' at index 3 should be removed.
- However, the code would return `"bc"` correctly in this case.
  
- Now consider the input `s = "a"` and `c = "a"`. The expected output should be an empty string `""`, but the function will return `s` which is `"a"`.

This shows that the program does not handle the edge case where the string consists of the character to be removed only once or if the string is very short (like a single character). 

**Conclusion:**
The program fails for the case where the string consists only of the character to be removed, as it does not return an empty string in that scenario.

Correctness: **False**.
