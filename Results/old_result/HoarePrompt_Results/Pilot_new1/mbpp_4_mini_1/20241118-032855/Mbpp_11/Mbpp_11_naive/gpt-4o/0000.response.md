To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Finding First and Last Occurrences**:
   - `first_index = s.find(ch)` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of `ch`.
   - `last_index = s.rfind(ch)` correctly finds the index of the last occurrence of `ch`.

2. **Condition for No Removal**:
   - The condition `if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:` checks if:
     - The character `ch` is not found at all (both indices are -1).
     - The character appears only once (first and last indices are the same).
   - In either case, it returns the original string `s`, which is correct.

3. **Removing the Characters**:
   - The return statement constructs a new string by:
     - Taking all characters from the start up to the first occurrence of `ch` (`s[:first_index]`).
     - Skipping the first occurrence (`s[first_index + 1:last_index]`).
     - Taking all characters after the last occurrence (`s[last_index + 1:]`).
   - This logic works correctly if there are at least two occurrences of `ch`.

### Edge Cases:
- Let's consider a case where `ch` is not present in the string:
  - `func_1('hello', 'x')` should return `'hello'` (correct).
- A case where `ch` appears only once:
  - `func_1('hello', 'h')` should return `'hello'` (correct).
- A case where `ch` appears multiple times:
  - `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'` (correct).
- A case where the string is empty or `ch` is an empty string:
  - `func_1('', 'l')` should return `''` (correct).
  - `func_1('hello', '')` should return `'hello'` (correct).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program against the problem description and considering various edge cases, the program behaves correctly for all scenarios described. It handles the removal of the first and last occurrences of the specified character properly.

Correctness: **True**.
