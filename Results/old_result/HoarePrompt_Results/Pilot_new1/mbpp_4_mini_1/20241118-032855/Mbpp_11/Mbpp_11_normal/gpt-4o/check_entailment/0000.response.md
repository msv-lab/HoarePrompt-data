To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 

### Program:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]

assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found in `s`, or if `ch` appears only once in `s`. If `ch` appears more than once, it returns the string `s` with both the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Finding Indices**: The function correctly finds the first and last occurrence of the character `ch` using `find()` and `rfind()`.
2. **Handling Cases**: 
   - If `ch` is not found (i.e., `first_index == -1`), the string is returned unchanged.
   - If `ch` appears only once (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), the string is also returned unchanged.
   - If `ch` appears more than once, it constructs a new string with the first and last occurrences removed.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Character Not Present**: If `ch` is not in `s`, the function returns `s` as expected.
2. **Character Appears Once**: If `ch` appears once, the function returns `s` as expected.
3. **Character Appears Multiple Times**: The function correctly removes both the first and last occurrences.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints are consistent with the code:
- The function does return the original string if `ch` is not found or appears only once.
- The function does remove both occurrences when `ch` appears more than once.

### Potential Issues:
However, there is a potential edge case that the code does not handle correctly:
- If `s` is an empty string (`''`), the function will return `''` without any error, which is acceptable. 
- If `s` consists of only one character (e.g., `s = 'a'` and `ch = 'a'`), the function will return `s` unchanged, which is also acceptable.
- If `s` consists of the same character repeated (e.g., `s = 'aaaa'` and `ch = 'a'`), the function will remove the first and last occurrences correctly, returning `aaa`.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly handles all described cases in the problem statement and aligns with the output hints provided. After thorough analysis, I cannot find any potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
