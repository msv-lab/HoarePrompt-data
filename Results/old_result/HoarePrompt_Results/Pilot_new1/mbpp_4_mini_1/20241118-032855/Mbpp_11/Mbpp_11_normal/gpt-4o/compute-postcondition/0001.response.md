The code assigns the value of `last_index` to the result of `s.rfind(ch)`, which finds the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. The value of `last_index` will be the index of that occurrence or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. The variables `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index`, along with the newly computed `last_index`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found**
