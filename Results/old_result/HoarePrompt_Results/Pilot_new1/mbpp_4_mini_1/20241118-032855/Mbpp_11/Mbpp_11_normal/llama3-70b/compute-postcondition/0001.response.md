The code assigns `last_occ` the value of `s.rfind(c)`, which finds the last occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is found, `last_occ` will be the index of its last occurrence; if not found, it will be -1. The values of the other variables `s`, `c`, and `first_occ` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a single character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found**
