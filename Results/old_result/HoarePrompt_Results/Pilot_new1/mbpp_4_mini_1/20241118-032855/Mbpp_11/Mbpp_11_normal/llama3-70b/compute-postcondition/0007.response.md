The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `c`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `c` is a single character. After executing the function body, the function determines the indices of the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`, denoted as `first_occ` and `last_occ`, respectively. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1, indicating that `c` was found in `s`, the function returns a new string formed by removing the first occurrence of `c`, followed by the substring between the first and last occurrences of `c`, and the substring following the last occurrence of `c`. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, meaning `c` is not found in `s`, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `c`, and return a modified version of `s` based on the occurrences of `c`, or return `s` unchanged if `c` is not present.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`, returns a modified string by removing the first occurrence of `c` and including the substring between the first and last occurrences of `c`, followed by the substring after the last occurrence of `c`, or returns the original string `s` unchanged if `c` is not found.**
