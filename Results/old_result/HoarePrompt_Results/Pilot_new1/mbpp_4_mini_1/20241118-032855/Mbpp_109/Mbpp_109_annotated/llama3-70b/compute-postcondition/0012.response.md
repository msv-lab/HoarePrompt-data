Output State: **`count` is the sum of the counts of '1's in the substrings of `s` from index `i` to `i + len(s)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is the binary string repeated enough times to ensure its length is at least `n`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
