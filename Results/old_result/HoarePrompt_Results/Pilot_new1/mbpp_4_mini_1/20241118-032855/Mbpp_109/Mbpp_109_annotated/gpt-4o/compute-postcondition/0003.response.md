The variable `integer_value` is assigned the value of `int(binary_str, 2)`, which converts the binary string `binary_str` to its integer representation. The initial values of `binary_str` and `num_rotations` do not affect this operation, and `count` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the conversion process.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, and `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str`**
