The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s` multiplied by `(n // len(s) + 1)`. The expression `n // len(s)` calculates how many times the length of `s` fits into `n`, and adding 1 ensures that `s` is repeated enough times to exceed `n`. Therefore, `s` will be repeated a certain number of times based on the value of `n` and the length of `s`. The other variable `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is the binary string repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `n` is a non-negative integer**
