The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `count` has increased. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2, and `count` is increased by 1**
