The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. The parameter `binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, while `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it returns the number of times the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2 is odd after each rotation, which is stored in `count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string and a non-negative integer, and return the count of odd integer representations after performing the specified number of rotations on the binary string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter binary_str (a string of '0's and '1's) and num_rotations (a non-negative integer), and returns the count of how many times the integer representation of binary_str in base 2 is odd after each rotation.**
