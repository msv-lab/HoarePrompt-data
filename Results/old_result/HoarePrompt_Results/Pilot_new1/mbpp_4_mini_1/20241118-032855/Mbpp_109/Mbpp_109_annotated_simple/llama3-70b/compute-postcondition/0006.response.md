The variable `temp` is assigned the value of the substring `s[i:i + len(s)]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `len(s)` is the length of the binary string `s`, `temp` will contain the substring starting from index 1 to index `1 + len(s)`, which effectively takes the second character of `s` up to the length of `s`. 

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `count`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the binary string repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `temp` contains the substring `s[1:len(s)+1]`.

Output State: **`s` is the binary string repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `temp` contains the substring `s[1:len(s)+1]**
