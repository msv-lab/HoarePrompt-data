According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `count` is initialized to 0, but it does not affect the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0. Since we are not modifying `binary_str` or `count` for the loop to execute, we can state that `num_rotations` is greater than 0 and the loop will start with `_` being 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `_` is 0**
