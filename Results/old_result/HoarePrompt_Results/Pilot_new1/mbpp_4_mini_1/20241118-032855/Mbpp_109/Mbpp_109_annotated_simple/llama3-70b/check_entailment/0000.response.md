To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: if n is at least 1 then count is the sum of the odd counts of '1's in substrings of length len(s) from s, if n is 0 then count remains 0 and the loop does not execute.
    return count
    #The program returns the sum of the odd counts of '1's in substrings of length len(s) from s, or returns 0 if n is 0
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **String Expansion**: The line `s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)` ensures that the string `s` is long enough to accommodate `n` rotations without running out of bounds.
2. **Counting Odd '1's**: The loop iterates `n` times, extracting a substring of length `len(s)` starting from each index `i` in the range of `n`. It counts how many of these substrings have an odd number of '1's.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of odd '1's across all substrings.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `len(s)`. If `n` is smaller than the length of `s`, the code may not correctly compute the number of odd '1's because it will only consider the first `n` characters repeatedly, which does not represent all possible rotations.
- The program assumes that the string `s` will always be rotated `n` times, which can lead to incorrect counts if `n` is less than the length of `s`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `s = "1110"` and `n = 3`. The expected rotations would be:
- 1st rotation: "1110" (3 '1's, odd)
- 2nd rotation: "1101" (3 '1's, odd)
- 3rd rotation: "1011" (3 '1's, odd)

The expected output should be `3` since all rotations have an odd count of '1's. However, if `n` is less than `len(s)`, the program does not account for all rotations properly.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle cases where `n` is less than `len(s)`, it can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
