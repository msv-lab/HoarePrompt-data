To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` against the problem description.

The problem description requires a function that counts the number of odd integer values resulting from rotating a binary string a specified number of times.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Rotation Logic**: The program rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times by moving the last character to the front. This is correctly implemented with the line:
   ```python
   binary_str = binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]
   ```

2. **Integer Conversion**: After each rotation, the binary string is converted to an integer using:
   ```python
   integer_value = int(binary_str, 2)
   ```
   This conversion is correct for interpreting the binary string as an integer.

3. **Odd Value Check**: The program checks if the integer value is odd using:
   ```python
   if integer_value % 2 == 1:
   ```
   This correctly identifies odd integers.

4. **Counting Odd Values**: The program maintains a count of how many times an odd integer is encountered over the rotations, which is also correctly implemented.

### Testing Edge Cases:

- **Single Character Binary String**: For example, `func_1('0', 1)` should return `0` since `0` is even.
- **All Zeros**: For `func_1('0000', 4)`, it should return `0` since all rotations will still result in `0`.
- **All Ones**: For `func_1('1111', 4)`, it should return `4` since all rotations will result in `15`, which is odd.
- **Empty String**: For `func_1('', 1)`, this should be handled gracefully, ideally returning `0` or raising an error.

### Conclusion:

The function seems to handle the basic cases well, but it does not account for edge cases such as:
- An empty binary string.
- A single character binary string.

Given that the program does not handle all potential cases as described, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

### Example of Failure:
- Calling `func_1('', 1)` would raise a `TypeError` because the program attempts to access `binary_str[-1]` on an empty string, which is out of bounds. Thus, the program does not work as expected for this case.
