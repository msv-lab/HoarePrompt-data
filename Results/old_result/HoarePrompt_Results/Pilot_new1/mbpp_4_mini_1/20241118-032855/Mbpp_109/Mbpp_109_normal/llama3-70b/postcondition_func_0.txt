The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the count of substrings of `s` that contain an odd number of '1's. If `n` is greater than the length of `s`, the function will only consider substrings up to the length of `s`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 since no substrings can be counted.
