According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variables `binary_str` and `count` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0, and the loop variable `_` can be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `_` is 0**
