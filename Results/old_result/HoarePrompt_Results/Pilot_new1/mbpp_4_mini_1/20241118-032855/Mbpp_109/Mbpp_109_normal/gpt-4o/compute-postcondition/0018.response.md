Output State: **`binary_str` is the final rotated binary string after `num_rotations` rotations, `count` is the number of times the decimal equivalent of `binary_str` is odd. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `binary_str` remains unchanged while `count` is 0. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` can range from 0 to `num_rotations`, depending on the odd/even nature of the integer values derived from the rotations of `binary_str`.**
