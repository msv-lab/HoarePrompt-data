The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. The parameter `binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, while `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it returns the number of times the decimal equivalent of `binary_str` is odd after performing `num_rotations` rotations, which is represented by the variable `count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string and a non-negative integer, and return the count of how many times the decimal equivalent of the binary string is odd after the specified number of rotations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and returns the count of how many times the decimal equivalent of `binary_str` is odd after `num_rotations` rotations.**
