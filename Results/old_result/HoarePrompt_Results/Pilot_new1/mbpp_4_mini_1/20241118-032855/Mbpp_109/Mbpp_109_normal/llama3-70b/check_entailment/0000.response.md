To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** The task is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the count of substrings of `s` that contain an odd number of '1's. If `n` is greater than the length of `s`, the function will only consider substrings up to the length of `s`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 since no substrings can be counted.

### Initial Assessment

1. **Understanding of the Code:**
   - The code first extends the binary string `s` by repeating it enough times to cover `n` rotations.
   - It then iterates `n` times, creating a substring `temp` of length equal to the original string `s` starting from each index `i`.
   - It counts how many of these substrings contain an odd number of '1's.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 0, the function should return 0, which is correctly handled.
   - If `n` is larger than the length of `s`, the function should only consider substrings of length equal to `s`, which is also handled in the code.
   - The function does not account for cases where the binary string might be empty, which could lead to an issue if `s` is an empty string.

### Verification Against Output Hints

The output hints state:
- The function returns the count of substrings of `s` that contain an odd number of '1's.
- If `n` is greater than the length of `s`, only substrings up to the length of `s` are considered.
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.

The hints seem to agree with the code's logic, but we need to consider the edge case of an empty string.

### Conclusion

The code does not handle the case where the binary string `s` is empty. If `s` is empty and `n` is greater than 0, the code will attempt to create substrings, leading to an index error or incorrect results. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails when the input string `s` is empty and `n` is greater than 0, as it will not return a valid count of substrings with odd '1's.
