The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2, so after execution, `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of `binary_str`, `count` is 3, `_` is 2.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of `binary_str`, `count` is 3, `_` is 2**
