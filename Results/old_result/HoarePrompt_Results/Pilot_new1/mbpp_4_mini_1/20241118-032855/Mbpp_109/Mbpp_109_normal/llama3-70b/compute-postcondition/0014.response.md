The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. The parameter `s` is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's, while `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it returns the number of substrings of `s` that contain an odd number of '1's, based on the value of `count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the count of substrings of `s` that have an odd number of '1's. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string s and a non-negative integer n, returning the number of substrings of s that contain an odd number of '1's.**
