The value of `s` is repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times. The previous value of `s` is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's, and `n` is a non-negative integer. The length of `s` affects how many times it will be repeated, but since the exact values of `s` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of their relationship. 

Output State: **`s` is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `s` is updated to be repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times.**
