Functionality: ** The function accepts a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. It rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times to the right, converting the resulting binary string to its decimal equivalent each time. It counts and returns the number of times this decimal equivalent is odd. If `num_rotations` is 0, the function returns 0, as the binary string remains unchanged and is not evaluated. **
