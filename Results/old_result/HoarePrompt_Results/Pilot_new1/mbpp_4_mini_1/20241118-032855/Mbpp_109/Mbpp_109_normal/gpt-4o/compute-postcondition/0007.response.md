According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, and the value of `_` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `num_rotations` must remain greater than `_`.

Since `_` starts at 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be adjusted to 1. The condition that `num_rotations` is greater than 0 will still hold true as long as it is greater than 1.

State: **`binary_str` is a valid binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is 1 if `integer_value` is odd; otherwise, `count` remains 0, `_` is 1, and `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of `binary_str`.**
