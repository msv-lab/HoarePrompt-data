According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `num_rotations` is greater than the current iteration count. At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, which means it can execute again. 

To execute one more time, `num_rotations` must be adjusted to be greater than 2. The other states, such as `binary_str`, `integer_value`, and `count`, do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration since they are not directly related to the loop control variable.

State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 2, and `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of `binary_str`, `count` remains 3**
