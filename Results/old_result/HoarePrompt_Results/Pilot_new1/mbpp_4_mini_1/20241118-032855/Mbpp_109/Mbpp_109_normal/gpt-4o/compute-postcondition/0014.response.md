The variable `integer_value` is assigned the value of `int(binary_str, 2)`, which converts the binary string `binary_str` into its decimal equivalent. The previous values of `binary_str`, `num_rotations`, `count`, and `_` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `integer_value` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of `binary_str`, `count` is 2, `_` is 2**
