To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description, which states that we need to find the length of the longest sublists in a list of lists.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max((len(sublist) for sublist in lists))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists. It uses a generator expression to compute the length of each sublist and then applies the `max` function to find the longest sublist's length.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `lists` is empty (`[]`), the call to `max` will raise a `ValueError` because `max` cannot operate on an empty iterable.
   - If `lists` contains sublists of varying lengths, the function should correctly return the length of the longest one.
   - If any of the sublists are empty, those lengths will be counted as `0`, and the function should still be able to handle this without failure.

### Test Cases:

- **Case 1**: `func_1([])` should raise an error since there are no sublists to evaluate.
- **Case 2**: `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]])` should return `3` since the longest sublist is `[3, 4, 5]`.
- **Case 3**: `func_1([[1], [], [2, 3, 4, 5]])` should return `4` since the longest sublist is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- **Case 4**: `func_1([[], [], []])` should return `0` since all sublists are empty.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the edge case where `lists` is empty, leading to a potential runtime error. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
