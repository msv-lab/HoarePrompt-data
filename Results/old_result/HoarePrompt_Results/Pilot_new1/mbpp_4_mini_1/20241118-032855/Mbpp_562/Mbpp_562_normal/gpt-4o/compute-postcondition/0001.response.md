According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute. Since `max_length` is set to 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, and `sublist` will represent the first sublist in the list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list, `max_length` is 0**
