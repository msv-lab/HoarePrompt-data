The value of `max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length is determined by the number of elements it contains. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the length of `sublist` being assigned to `max_length`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`**
