Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least one sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list, and `max_length` is non-negative. If the length of `sublist` is greater than the initial value of `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. If the length of `sublist` is less than or equal to `max_length`, then `max_length` remains unchanged.***
