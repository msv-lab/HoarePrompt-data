To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function to find the length of the longest sublists from a list of lists.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max(len(sublist) for sublist in lists)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist in the list of lists 'lists'
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes a parameter `lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists.
2. It uses a generator expression to calculate the length of each sublist and then applies the `max()` function to find the maximum length among those lengths.
3. The annotation correctly states that the program returns the length of the longest sublist.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Input**: If `lists` is an empty list (`[]`), the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot operate on an empty sequence.
- **All Empty Sublists**: If `lists` contains only empty sublists (e.g., `[[], [], []]`), the `max()` function will again raise a `ValueError` because it will be trying to find the maximum of an empty sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge cases of an empty input list or a list containing only empty sublists. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
