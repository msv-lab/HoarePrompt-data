The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of `len(sublist)`, which calculates the length of the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. The previous value of `max_length` could either be the length of `sublist` or 0, but now it is updated to the actual length of `sublist`. The state of `list_of_lists` and `sublist` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list, and `max_length` is now the length of `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`**
