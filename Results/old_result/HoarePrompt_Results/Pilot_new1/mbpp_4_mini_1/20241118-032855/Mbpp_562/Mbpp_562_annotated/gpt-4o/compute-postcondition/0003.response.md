The value of `max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists` and its length is greater than `max_length`, `max_length` will now hold the value of the length of `sublist`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_length` is now equal to the length of `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_length` is now equal to the length of `sublist`.**
