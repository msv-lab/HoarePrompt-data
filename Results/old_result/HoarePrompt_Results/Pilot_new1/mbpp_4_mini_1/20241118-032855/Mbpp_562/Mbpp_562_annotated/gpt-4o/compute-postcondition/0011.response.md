According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least 4 sublists, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 4 sublists. The current `sublist` would need to be the fourth sublist in the list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 4 sublists, sublist is the fourth sublist in the list**
