According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. The `max_length` variable does not affect the ability of the loop to run but may be relevant within the loop body. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist. Therefore, we can state the conditions as follows: `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist, and `sublist` will be the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is 0**
