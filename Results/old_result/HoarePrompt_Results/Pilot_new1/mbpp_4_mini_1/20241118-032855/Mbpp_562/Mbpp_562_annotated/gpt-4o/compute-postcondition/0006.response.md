The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of `len(sublist)`, which calculates the length of the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. The initial state indicates that `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, so `sublist` is valid, and `max_length` will now hold the length of that sublist. The previous value of `max_length` was 0, but it changes based on the length of `sublist`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`**
