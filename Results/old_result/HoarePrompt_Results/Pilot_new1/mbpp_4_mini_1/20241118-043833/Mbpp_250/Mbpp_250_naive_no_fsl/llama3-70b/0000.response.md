Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as arguments and uses the `count` method of tuples to return the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple.

Here are the considerations that support the correctness:

1. **Functionality**: The `count` method is specifically designed to count occurrences of an element in a tuple, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to count occurrences of the given element.

2. **Edge Cases**: The function handles various scenarios:
   - If the tuple is empty, it will return 0, which is the expected behavior since there are no elements to count.
   - If the element is not present in the tuple, it will also return 0, which is correct.
   - If the element appears multiple times, it will accurately count and return that number.

3. **Data Types**: The function can handle any data type that can be present in a tuple, including integers, strings, and even other tuples.

Given that the function behaves correctly for all potential cases based on the problem description, there are no identified issues or edge cases that it fails to handle. Thus, the program is correct.
