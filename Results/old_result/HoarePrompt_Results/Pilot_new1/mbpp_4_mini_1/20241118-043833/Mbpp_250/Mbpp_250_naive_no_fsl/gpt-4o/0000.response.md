Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as inputs and utilizes the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element. 

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function works correctly for the tested cases:
- The first assertion checks that the element `4` occurs `0` times in the tuple, which is correct.
- The second assertion verifies that the element `10` occurs `3` times in the tuple, which is also correct.
- The third assertion confirms that the element `8` occurs `4` times in the tuple, which is accurate.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and utilizes the appropriate method to count occurrences, it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. There are no edge cases or missing logic identified that would cause the function to fail for valid inputs. Thus, the program is correct.
