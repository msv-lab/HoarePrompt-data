The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two lists: the first list contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists and return a list containing two separate lists with the first and second elements of each sublist, respectively.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of sublists containing exactly two elements each, and returns a list containing two lists: the first list with the first elements of each sublist and the second list with the second elements of each sublist.**
