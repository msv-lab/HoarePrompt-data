The code creates a new list `first_elements` that contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements, `first_elements` will be populated with the first elements of each of those sublists. The state of `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `first_elements` is a list of the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`**
