To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze both the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a list of lists, where each sublist contains two elements. It should return a list of two lists: the first list containing the first elements of each sublist, and the second list containing the second elements.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list(element[0] for element in list_of_lists), list(element[1] for element in list_of_lists)]
    # The program returns a list containing two lists: the first list contains all the first elements from each sublist in 'list_of_lists', and the second list contains all the second elements from each sublist in 'list_of_lists'.
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The code uses list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - It creates a new list containing two lists, which is what the problem description requires.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty list (`[]`), the function will return `[[], []]`, which is still a valid output since there are no sublists to extract elements from.
   - **Single Sublist**: If the input is a list with a single sublist (e.g., `[[1, 2]]`), the output will be `[[1], [2]]`, which is correct.
   - **Mismatched Lengths**: If the sublists do not have exactly two elements (e.g., `[[1], [2, 3]]`), this will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `element[1]` for the first sublist. This is a critical edge case that the function does not handle.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases where the sublists do not contain exactly two elements. Therefore, it does not meet the problem's requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
