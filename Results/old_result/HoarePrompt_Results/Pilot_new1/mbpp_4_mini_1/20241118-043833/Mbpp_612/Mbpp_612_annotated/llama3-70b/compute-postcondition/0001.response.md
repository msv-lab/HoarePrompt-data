The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two sublists: the first sublist consists of all the first elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, and the second sublist consists of all the second elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists and return a new list containing two sublists, one for the first elements and one for the second elements of the input sublists.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of sublists containing exactly two elements each, and returns a list containing two sublists: one with all the first elements and another with all the second elements from the input sublists.**
