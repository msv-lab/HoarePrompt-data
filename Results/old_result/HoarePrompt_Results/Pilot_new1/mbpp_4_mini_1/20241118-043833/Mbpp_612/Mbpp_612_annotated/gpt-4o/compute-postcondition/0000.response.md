The code assigns `first_elements` the value of a list comprehension that extracts the first element from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with each sublist containing exactly two elements, `first_elements` will contain the first elements of all the sublists. The state of `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`**
