Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum of two numbers. The function `func_1(a, b)` returns `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This correctly identifies the larger of the two inputs.

Here's the reasoning for its correctness:
- If `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns `a`, which is correct.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, the function returns `b`, which is also correct.
- The function handles all possible cases, including when `a` and `b` are equal, in which case it will return `b` (which is equal to `a`).

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential inputs (including negative numbers, zero, and equal values), it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
