Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them. It does not handle cases where both parameters are equal, but it will still return one of the equal values as the maximum. The function works for any comparable types, including integers, floats, and strings, as long as they are of the same type. **
