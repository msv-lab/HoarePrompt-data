Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the maximum of two numbers. It utilizes Python's built-in `max` function, which is designed to return the largest of the input values. 

This implementation will work for all potential cases, including:

1. Both numbers being positive.
2. Both numbers being negative.
3. One number being positive and the other being negative.
4. Both numbers being zero.
5. Both numbers being the same.

In every case, the `max` function will accurately return the maximum value as expected. Since I cannot identify any case where the function would fail to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
