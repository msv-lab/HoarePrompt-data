The provided program is designed to find the maximum of two numbers. The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if `a` is greater than `b` and returns `a` if true; otherwise, it returns `b`. This logic seems straightforward and aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should find the maximum of two numbers.

However, we need to examine potential edge cases. The problem description does not specify how to handle cases where both numbers are equal. The function will return either `a` or `b` in such cases, which is acceptable since they are the same. 

Now, let's analyze the output hints: they state that the function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater of the two values. They also mention that in the case where both values are equal, it returns either `a` or `b`, which aligns with the function's behavior. 

After reviewing the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I find no edge cases that the code does not handle correctly. The function works as intended for all specified cases, including when the two numbers are equal.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum of two numbers and handles all potential cases as described.
