Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `num`, which can be a string or a number convertible to a complex number, and returns the polar coordinates (r, theta) of the complex number created from `num`, where r is the magnitude and theta is the phase angle. It does not handle cases where `num` is not convertible to a complex number, which could raise a ValueError. **
