Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes a complex number `c` as input and returns a tuple containing the absolute value and the phase (angle) of the complex number. The annotations confirm that the function is designed to return these two values, which aligns with the problem description.

The function uses `abs(c)` to compute the absolute value (magnitude) of the complex number and `cmath.phase(c)` to compute the phase (angle) of the complex number, both of which are correct operations for complex numbers. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The annotations also do not present any contradictions or missing cases, as they accurately describe the function's behavior.

Thus, since the implementation is correct for all potential cases, the final conclusion is that the program is correct.
