Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it only retains uppercase characters. This does not fulfill the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output should be "HW" (removing the lowercase substrings "ello" and "orld"). However, if the input string is "abcDef", the expected output should be "D", but the program will return "D" which is correct. 

However, if the input string is "abc", the expected output should be an empty string "", since all characters are lowercase, but the program will return an empty string as well, which is correct. 

The program does not handle the case where it should remove entire substrings of lowercase letters; it only removes individual lowercase characters. Therefore, it does not satisfy the requirement of removing lowercase substrings as described. 

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements in all potential cases.
