Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the function should "remove lowercase substrings from a given string." However, the provided program does not fulfill this requirement. Instead, it returns a string that contains only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`, effectively filtering out all characters that are not uppercase.

The annotations state that the function "returns a string containing only the uppercase characters from the string 's'," which aligns with what the code does. However, this does not match the problem description that explicitly requires the removal of lowercase substrings, not just filtering out lowercase characters. 

For example, consider the input string "Hello World". The expected output based on the problem description would be "H W", which removes the lowercase substrings "ello" and "orld". However, the actual output of the program would be "HW", which does not satisfy the requirement of removing lowercase substrings.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
