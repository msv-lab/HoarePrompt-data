The provided program is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, returning a new string that contains only the uppercase characters. 

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string `s`, and it checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it is included in the new string; otherwise, it is ignored.

Now, let's consider the output hints:
- The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string that contains only the uppercase characters from `s`.
- It does not handle any specific edge cases such as empty strings, but it will simply return an empty string if there are no uppercase characters present.

### Assessment:
1. The code correctly removes lowercase characters and retains uppercase characters as per the problem description.
2. The output hints agree with the code's functionality. They confirm that the function will return an empty string if there are no uppercase characters, which is the expected behavior.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty string input `''` would return `''`, which is correct.
- A string with only lowercase characters, such as `'abc'`, would also return `''`, which is correct.
- A string with no lowercase characters, such as `'ABC'`, would return `'ABC'`, which is correct.

Since the code handles these cases correctly and aligns with the problem description and output hints, I do not see any potential cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly implements the requirement to remove lowercase substrings, returning only the uppercase characters, and it handles edge cases appropriately.
