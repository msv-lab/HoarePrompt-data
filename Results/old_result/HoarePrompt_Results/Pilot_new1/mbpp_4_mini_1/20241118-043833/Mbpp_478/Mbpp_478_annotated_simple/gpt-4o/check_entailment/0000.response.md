Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program only retains uppercase characters and discards all other characters, including lowercase letters and non-alphabetic characters. 

For example, consider the input string "Hello World!". The expected output, according to the problem description, would be "H W" (removing the lowercase substrings "ello" and "orld"). However, the program would return "HW", which does not align with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description in every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
