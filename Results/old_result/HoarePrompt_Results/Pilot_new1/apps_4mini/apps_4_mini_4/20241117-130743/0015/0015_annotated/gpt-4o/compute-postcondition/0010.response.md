The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation. The initial conditions regarding the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` remain valid. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is not equal to 0; either `(b - a) % c != 0` or `(b - a) / c < 0` (or both); and the output is 'NO'**.
