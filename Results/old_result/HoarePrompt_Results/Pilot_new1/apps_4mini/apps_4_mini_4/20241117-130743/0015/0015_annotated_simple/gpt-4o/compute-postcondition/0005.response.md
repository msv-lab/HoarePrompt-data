The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed message.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0; and 'NO' is printed.**
