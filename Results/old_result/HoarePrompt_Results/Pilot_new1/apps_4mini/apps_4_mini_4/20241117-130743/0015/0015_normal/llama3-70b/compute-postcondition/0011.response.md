The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, and the output is 'NO'**
