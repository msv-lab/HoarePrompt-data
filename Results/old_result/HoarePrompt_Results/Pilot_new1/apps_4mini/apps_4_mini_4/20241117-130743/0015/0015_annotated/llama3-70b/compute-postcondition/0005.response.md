The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the value of `c` is 0; `a` is not equal to `b`; and 'NO' is printed.**
