The code prints 'YES', but does not change the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. Since `b` is equal to `a`, we can state that `b` is also equal to `a`. The output state reflects that the print operation has occurred, but the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the value of `b` is equal to the value of `a`; 'YES' is printed**.
