The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integers based on user input, which is split into three parts and converted to integers. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by the input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now new integers based on the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers based on input**
