The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`, which remain integers within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print operation occurred.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; the output is 'NO'**
