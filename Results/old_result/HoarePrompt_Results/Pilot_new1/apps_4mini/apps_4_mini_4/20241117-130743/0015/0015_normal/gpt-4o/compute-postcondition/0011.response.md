Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, where `c` is not equal to 0 and `b` is not equal to `a`. If `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, the output is 'NO'.***
