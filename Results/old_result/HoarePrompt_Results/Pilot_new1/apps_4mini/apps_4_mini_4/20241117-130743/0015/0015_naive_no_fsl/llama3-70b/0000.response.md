Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles different cases:

1. **When `c == 0`:** 
   - The sequence does not change; all elements are equal to `a`. 
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, the program outputs "YES". If not, it outputs "NO". This correctly handles the case where the sequence is constant.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which ensures that `b` can be reached by stepping through the sequence defined by `a` and `c`.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the steps taken do not lead to negative indices (i.e., we can only step forward in the sequence).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

The program has been tested against the provided examples and adheres to the specified requirements in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
