The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program prints 'YES' while the initial conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of (b - a) / c is non-negative; the program prints 'YES'.**
