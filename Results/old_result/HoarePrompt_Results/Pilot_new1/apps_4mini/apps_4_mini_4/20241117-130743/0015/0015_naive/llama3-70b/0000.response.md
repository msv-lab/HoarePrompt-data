To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The program checks if a favorite integer `b` appears in a sequence starting from `a` with a common difference `c`. The sequence can be expressed as:
- \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \)

The program handles two cases:
1. When `c == 0`: It checks if `a` is equal to `b`, since all elements in the sequence will be equal to `a`.
2. When `c != 0`: It checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and that the result is non-negative, which indicates that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` a certain number of times.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- If `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`, the output should be "YES" (as all terms are 0).
- If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 0`, the output should be "YES" (since the sequence is constant).
- If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 1`, the output should be "YES" (since the sequence is 1, 2, 3, ...).
- If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 2`, the output should be "NO" (sequence is 1, 3, 5, ...).
- If `a = 1`, `b = 3`, and `c = 1`, the output should be "YES" (sequence is 1, 2, 3, ...).
- If `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `c = 0`, the output should be "YES".

All of these checks are handled correctly by the program. 

However, let's consider a case where the logic might fail:
- If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = -1`, the program will output "NO" because `(b - a) / c` will be negative. However, the sequence is `1, 0, -1, -2, ...`, and `2` is not in the sequence. The program incorrectly allows for a positive result when `c` is negative but does not account for the direction of the sequence.

Given this analysis, we find that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
