Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; otherwise, 'NO' is printed if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or is negative.***
