The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained to be between -10^9 and 10^9. The function likely returns a value based on these integers, but the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully determined without additional information on what the function returns based on `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes three integers a, b, and c, which are constrained between -10^9 and 10^9. The specific return value is not defined in the given information.**
