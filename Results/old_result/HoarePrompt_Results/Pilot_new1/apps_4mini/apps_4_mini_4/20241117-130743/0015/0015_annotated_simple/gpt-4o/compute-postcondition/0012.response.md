Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; otherwise, 'NO' is printed if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or is negative.***
