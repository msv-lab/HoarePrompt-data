Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes cases where `c` is positive or negative, and checks for the divisibility and non-negativity of the difference `(b - a)`.***
