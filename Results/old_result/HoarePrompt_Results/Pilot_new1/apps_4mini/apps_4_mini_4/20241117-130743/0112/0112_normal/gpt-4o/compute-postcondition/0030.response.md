Output State: **`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cubes have been used; if all digits in `digits` are found in `cube_faces`, then `used_cubes` will have True values for those cubes. If any digit cannot be matched with an unused cube, the function will return False. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all False). If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all False).**
