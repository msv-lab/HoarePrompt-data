The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. Since `n` is either 2 or 3, `cube` will contain at least 2 integers (as it is the second list in `cubes`). The previous values of `cube` and `digits` are not specified, but `digits` will now include the string representations of the integers present in `cube`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `digits` has been updated with new string values, but we cannot specify the exact contents of `cube` or the resulting `digits` without knowing the specific integers in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
