According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n` times, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which indicates that the loop has executed once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and we need to ensure that `i` remains less than `n`. Since `n` can be at most 3, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is at least 2 to allow another iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `used_cubes`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, and `digit` are not directly affected by the loop iteration count in this context.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, and `i` is 1**
