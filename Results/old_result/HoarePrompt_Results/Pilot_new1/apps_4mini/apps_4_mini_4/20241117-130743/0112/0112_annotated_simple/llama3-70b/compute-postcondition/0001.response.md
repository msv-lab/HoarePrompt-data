The statement initializes a list called `cubes` by taking input `n` times. Each input is split into integers and mapped into a list. The value of `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, meaning that `cubes` will be a list containing either one, two, or three lists of integers, based on user input. The state of `n` remains unchanged, but the state of `cubes` will depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on user input**
