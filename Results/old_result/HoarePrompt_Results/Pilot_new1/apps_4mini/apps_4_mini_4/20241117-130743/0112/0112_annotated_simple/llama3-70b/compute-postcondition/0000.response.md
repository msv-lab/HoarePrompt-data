The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 3\). Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
