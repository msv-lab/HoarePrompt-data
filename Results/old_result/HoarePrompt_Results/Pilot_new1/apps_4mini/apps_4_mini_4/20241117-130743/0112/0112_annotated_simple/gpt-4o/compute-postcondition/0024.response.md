Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean elements indicating whether each cube has been used. If `found` is False after checking the cubes, the function returns False. If `found` is True, the function does not execute this return statement, and the state of `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged with `found` set to False. Additionally, if `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces`, `found` will also remain False, leading to the return of False. Thus, if no cubes match the `digit`, the function returns False.***
