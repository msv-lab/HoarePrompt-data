Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of all integers found in the lists within `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, the loop executes for each list in `cubes`, updating `digits` accordingly. The value of `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with a length between 0 and 3.**
