The `digits` set is updated with string representations of each element in the `cube` list. The `cube` list is the third list in `cubes`, and since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, we can assume that `cubes` contains at least three lists, allowing `cube` to exist. 

The elements of `cube` will be converted to strings and added to `digits`. The previous state of `digits` is not specified, but it will now include the new string representations of the elements from `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of elements in `cube`.**
