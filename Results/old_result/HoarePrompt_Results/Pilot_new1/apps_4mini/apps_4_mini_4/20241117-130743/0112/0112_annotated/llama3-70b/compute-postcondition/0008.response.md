The `digits` variable is updated to contain string representations of integers in the `cube` list. The previous value of `cube` is not specified, but it is known that `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, which contains integers. 

Assuming `cube` is a list of integers, the `update` method will add the string representations of each integer in `cube` to the `digits` set. The state of `n` and `cubes` remains unchanged, and the variable `digits` now contains the string representations of all integers from `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`**.
