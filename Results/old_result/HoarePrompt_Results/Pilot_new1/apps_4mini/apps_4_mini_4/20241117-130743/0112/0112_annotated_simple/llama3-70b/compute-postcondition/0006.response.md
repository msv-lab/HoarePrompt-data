The code updates the `digits` variable with string representations of each element in the `cube` list. The value of `n` is an integer from 1 to 3, and `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, with `cube` being the second list. The specific values of `cube` are unknown, but they will be converted to strings and added to `digits`. 

Since `digits` is updated with string representations of the elements in `cube`, the output state reflects the new contents of `digits`. The previous values of `digits` are not specified, so we assume it was empty or had some initial values which will be combined with the new string representations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of elements in `cube`.**
