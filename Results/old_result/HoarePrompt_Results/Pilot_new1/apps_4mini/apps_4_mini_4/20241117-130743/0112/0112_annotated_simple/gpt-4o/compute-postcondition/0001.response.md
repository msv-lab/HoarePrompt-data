The code initializes a list `used_cubes` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The value of `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Therefore, `used_cubes` will be a list containing either 1, 2, or 3 elements, all of which will be `False`. The other variable `num` is not defined and is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of n elements, all set to False.**
