Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, and `i` is 0. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains False.***
