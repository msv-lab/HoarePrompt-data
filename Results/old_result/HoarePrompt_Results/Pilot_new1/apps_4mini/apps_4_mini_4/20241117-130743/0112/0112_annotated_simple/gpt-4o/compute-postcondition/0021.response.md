Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean elements indicating whether each cube has been used; if a cube is found to match the `digit`, it is set to True and `found` is set to True. If no match is found after checking all `n` cubes, `found` remains False. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` is False. If `digit` is not in any of the `cube_faces`, `found` will also remain False regardless of the state of `used_cubes`. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True before execution, it does not change, and the loop continues checking subsequent cubes.**
