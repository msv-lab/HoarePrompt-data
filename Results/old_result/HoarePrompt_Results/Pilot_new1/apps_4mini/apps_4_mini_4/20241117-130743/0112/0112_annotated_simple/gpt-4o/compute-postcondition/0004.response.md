According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, this means that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The state of `used_cubes` does not affect the execution of the loop but will be relevant during the iterations. The state of `found` being False indicates that no condition to exit the loop has been met yet.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to its starting value, which is 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
