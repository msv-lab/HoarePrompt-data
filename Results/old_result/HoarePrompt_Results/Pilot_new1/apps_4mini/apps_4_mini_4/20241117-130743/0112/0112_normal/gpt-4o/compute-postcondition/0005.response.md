Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is 0. The `i`-th cube face has not been used (`used_cubes[i]` is False) and the `digit` is present in the `i`-th list of `cube_faces`.***
