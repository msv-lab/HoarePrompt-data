The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`. The other variables (`n`, `used_cubes`, `digits`, `i`, and `digit`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list where the first element is True and the rest are False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list where the first element is True and the rest are False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`**
