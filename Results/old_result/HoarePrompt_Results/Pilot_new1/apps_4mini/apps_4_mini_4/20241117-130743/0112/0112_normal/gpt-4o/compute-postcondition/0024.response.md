Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean value. If `found` is False, the function returns False, indicating that `digit` was not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists or all cubes were already used. If `found` is True, the function does not execute the return statement, and the state remains unchanged. Thus, if the loop does not execute due to `n` being less than 1, `found` remains False and `used_cubes` remains unchanged.***
