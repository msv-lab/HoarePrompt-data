The value of `found` is assigned `True`, changing its previous state from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is now True.
