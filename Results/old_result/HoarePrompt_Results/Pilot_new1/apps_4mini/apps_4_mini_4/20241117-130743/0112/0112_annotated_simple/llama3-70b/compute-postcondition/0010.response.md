Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all unique integers found in the lists within `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, the loop executes at least once, and `digits` is updated accordingly. `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least `n` lists.**
