Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all unique integers found in the lists within `cubes`, except '0' if it was present. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, `digits` is updated accordingly, and `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. If '0' was in `digits`, it has been removed; otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged.***
