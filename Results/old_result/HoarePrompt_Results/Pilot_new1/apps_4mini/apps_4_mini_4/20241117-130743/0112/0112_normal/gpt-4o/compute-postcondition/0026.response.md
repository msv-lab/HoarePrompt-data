The value of `found` is reassigned to `False`, but it is already `False`, so there is no change in its state. The state of the other variable, `digits`, is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit.

Output State: **`found` is False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit**
