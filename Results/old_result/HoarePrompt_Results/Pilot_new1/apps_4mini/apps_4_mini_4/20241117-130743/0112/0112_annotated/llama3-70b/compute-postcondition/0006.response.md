The code updates the `digits` variable to contain string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. Since `n` is either 2 or 3, `cube` will have at least 2 integers (as it is the second list in `cubes`). The `digits` list will now include the string versions of those integers.

Assuming `cube` contains integers, `digits` will reflect those integers converted to strings.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`.**
