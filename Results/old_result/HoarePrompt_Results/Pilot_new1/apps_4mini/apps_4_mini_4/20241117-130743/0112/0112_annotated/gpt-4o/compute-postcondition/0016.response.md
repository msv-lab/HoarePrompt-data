The value of `i` is `n`, which is greater than 1. The code sets `used_cubes[i]` to `True`. However, since the index `i` is equal to `n`, this would result in an index out of range error for the list `used_cubes`, which only has indices from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the output state indicates that an error occurs due to the attempt to access an index that does not exist in the list.

Output State: **Error: index out of range for `used_cubes`**
