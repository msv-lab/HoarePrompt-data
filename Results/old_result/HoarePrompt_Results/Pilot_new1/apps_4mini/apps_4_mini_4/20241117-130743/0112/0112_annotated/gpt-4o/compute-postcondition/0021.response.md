Output State: **`used_cubes` will have at least one True value if `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` lists corresponding to the indices checked, and `found` will be True. If `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists or if all corresponding `used_cubes` values are already True, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all False) and `found` remains False. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains all False and `found` remains False. If `n` is greater than 3, it is an invalid state as per the initial conditions.**
