The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is 1, `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
