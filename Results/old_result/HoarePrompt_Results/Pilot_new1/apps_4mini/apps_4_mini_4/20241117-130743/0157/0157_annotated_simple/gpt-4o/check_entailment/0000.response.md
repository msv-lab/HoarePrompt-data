To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons, apples, and pears. The fruits must be used in a specific ratio to make a compote: for every 1 lemon, he needs 2 apples and 4 pears. The goal is to find out the maximum total number of fruits that can be used while adhering to this ratio.

### Annotations in the Code:
The annotations provided in the code correctly describe the logic. The code reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) based on the available fruits and their required ratios. The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.

### Code Review:
1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Ratio Calculation**: The calculation of `max_lemons` uses the `min` function to ensure that the number of lemons, apples (divided by 2), and pears (divided by 4) do not exceed the required ratios.
3. **Total Calculation**: The total number of fruits is then calculated using the correct formula based on the ratio.

### Edge Cases:
- If Nikolay has no lemons, apples, or pears, the program will correctly output 0 since `max_lemons` will be 0.
- The program accounts for all cases where the number of lemons, apples, or pears might not be enough to form even one complete set of the required ratio.

### Testing with Examples:
1. For input `2, 5, 7`, the output is `7`, which is correct.
2. For input `4, 7, 13`, the output is `21`, which is correct.
3. For input `2, 3, 2`, the output is `0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I find that the program accurately implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. There are no edge cases or inputs where the program would fail to produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
