To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we must analyze both the code and the annotations to ensure they align with the requirements of the task.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The fruits must be used in a specific ratio for the compote:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

The objective is to find out the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, adhering to this ratio.

### Code Analysis:
The code reads the counts of lemons, apples, and pears, and then calculates the maximum number of complete sets of the fruit ratio that can be made:
```python
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```
- `min_lemon` calculates how many complete sets can be made based on the available fruits.
- The total number of fruits used is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations state that the function calculates the minimum number of complete sets of lemonade that can be made using the available fruits and prints the total number of ingredients needed for those sets.

### Edge Cases and Examples:
1. **Example Input:**
   ```
   2
   5
   7
   ```
   - Calculation: `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Total fruits used: `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct)

2. **Example Input:**
   ```
   4
   7
   13
   ```
   - Calculation: `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Total fruits used: `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (Correct)

3. **Example Input:**
   ```
   2
   3
   2
   ```
   - Calculation: `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Total fruits used: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (Correct)

### Potential Issues:
The code correctly calculates the number of complete sets based on the available fruits and adheres to the required ratios. However, we must ensure that it handles all edge cases:
- The code assumes that `a`, `b`, and `c` are always positive integers as per the input constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000). If `a`, `b`, or `c` were to be less than the required amounts for even one set (e.g., no lemons or not enough apples or pears), the code would return 0, which is the expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, annotations, and the examples provided in the problem description, I can confirm that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases described. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
