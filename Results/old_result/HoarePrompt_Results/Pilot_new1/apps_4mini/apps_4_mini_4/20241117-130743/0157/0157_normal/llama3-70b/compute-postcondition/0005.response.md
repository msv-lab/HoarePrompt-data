The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any parameters in the signature. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on three positive integer values: `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The function is expected to return a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. 

Since there is no output description given, we cannot determine the exact functionality of the function. Therefore, we can only state that the function is intended to work with three positive integers within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, where each integer is between 1 and 1000. The specific return value is not provided.**
