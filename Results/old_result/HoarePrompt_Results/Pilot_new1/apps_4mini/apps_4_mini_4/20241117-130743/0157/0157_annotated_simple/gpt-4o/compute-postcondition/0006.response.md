The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value.
