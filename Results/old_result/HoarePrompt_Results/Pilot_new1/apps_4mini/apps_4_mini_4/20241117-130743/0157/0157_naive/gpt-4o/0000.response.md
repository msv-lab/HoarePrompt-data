Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. The logic works as follows:

1. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is constrained by the available lemons (`a`), apples (`b` divided by 2), and pears (`c` divided by 4). This is done using the `min` function.
2. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote based on the number of lemons that can be utilized.
3. The total is computed as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which correctly reflects the ratio of fruits.

The program also handles the edge case where not enough fruits are available to meet the ratio requirements, returning `0` in such cases. Thus, it adheres to the problem description for all potential inputs within the specified range.
