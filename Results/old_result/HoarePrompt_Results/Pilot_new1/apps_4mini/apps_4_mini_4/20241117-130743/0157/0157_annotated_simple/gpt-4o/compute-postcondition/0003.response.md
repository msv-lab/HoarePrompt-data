In this code snippet, `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum of three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. Therefore, `max_lemons` will be determined based on the values provided for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The output state will reflect the input values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the calculated value of `max_lemons`. Since the exact input values are not provided, the output state will indicate that `max_lemons` is the minimum of those three expressions.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of (a, b // 2, c // 4)**
