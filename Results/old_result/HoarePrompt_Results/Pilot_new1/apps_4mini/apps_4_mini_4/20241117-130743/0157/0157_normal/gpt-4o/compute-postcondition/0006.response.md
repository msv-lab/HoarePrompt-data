The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All three parameters are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any value as per the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three positive integer parameters representing quantities of fruits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.**
