Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers from input, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - One-fourth the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
   
   This is stored in the variable `min_lemon`.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits Used**: The program then computes the total number of fruits used in the compote based on the number of lemons (`min_lemon`), apples (`min_lemon * 2`), and pears (`min_lemon * 4`), and prints this total.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles cases where Nikolay cannot use any fruits. For example, if there are not enough pears (less than 4), the `min_lemon` will be zero, resulting in a total output of zero.

The program adheres to the problem requirements and correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in every case. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the problem's requirements. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed, and it is accurate for all potential inputs within the specified range.
