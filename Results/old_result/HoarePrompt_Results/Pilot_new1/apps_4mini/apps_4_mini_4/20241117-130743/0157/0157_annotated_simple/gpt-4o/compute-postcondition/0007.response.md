Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs from the user, representing the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the constraints of using half the apples and a quarter of the pears. The total number of fruits is then calculated as the sum of the maximum lemons, apples, and pears used, specifically returning the total fruit count as a printed output. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
