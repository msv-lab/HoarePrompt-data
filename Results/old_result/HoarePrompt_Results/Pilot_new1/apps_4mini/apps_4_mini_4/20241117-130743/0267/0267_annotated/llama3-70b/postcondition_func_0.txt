The function accepts two integers `l` and `r`, and an integer `k`, and returns the count of numbers in the range [1, r] that satisfy a condition defined by `k`, minus the count of numbers in the range [1, l-1] that satisfy the same condition, all computed modulo `MOD`. It does not handle potential edge cases where `l` could be greater than `r`, or where the counts could be negative before applying the modulo operation.
