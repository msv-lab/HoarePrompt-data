The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The variable `num` has a value of `l`, and since `total_sum` is initially 0, after the operation, `total_sum` will be equal to `l % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returning true does not affect the state of the variables in this context.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
