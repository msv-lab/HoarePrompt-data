To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact on the variable `dp[n, k]`.

1. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is given as `9 * 10`.
2. The variable `i` is 2.
3. The expression `10 ** (i - 1)` evaluates to `10 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `10 ** 1` or `10`.
4. The expression `10 ** (k - i)` evaluates to `10 ** (k - 2)`. Since `k` is between 2 and 10, this value will vary depending on the specific value of `k`.
5. Thus, `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2) - 10`. 

Now we can calculate the increment to `dp[n, k]`:

- The increment is `9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`.
- Therefore, the new value of `dp[n, k]` will be:

\[
dp[n, k] = 9 * 10 + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
dp[n, k] = 9 * 10 * (1 + (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)) = 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 9)
\]

The other variables `l`, `r`, and `n` remain unaffected by this operation.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 9)`; `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and `n` is unchanged.**
