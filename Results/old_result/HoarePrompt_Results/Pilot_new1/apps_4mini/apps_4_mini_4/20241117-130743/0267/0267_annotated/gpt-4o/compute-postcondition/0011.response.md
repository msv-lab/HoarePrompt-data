To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `num` in the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `r` has been increased by 1. This means that if `r` was `x` before the increment, it is now `x + 1`.
2. The loop will execute for `num` values starting from `l` up to `r + 1`. Since `r` is now `x + 1`, the loop will iterate for `num` values from `l` to `x + 1`.
3. To execute one more time, we need to ensure that `num` can take on the next value after the last iteration. The last value of `num` in the previous iteration would have been `r`, which is `x`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `num` needs to be `r + 1`, which is `x + 1`.
4. The state of `l` and `k` remains unchanged, as they do not affect the iteration condition.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be adjusted to reflect that it can accommodate one more iteration.

State: **`l` remains unchanged, `r` is increased by 1, `k` remains unchanged**
