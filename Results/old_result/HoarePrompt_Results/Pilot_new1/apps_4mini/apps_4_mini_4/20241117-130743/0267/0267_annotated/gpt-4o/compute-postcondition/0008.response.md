According to the code, the loop is dependent on the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` would be equal to `r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to `r + 1`, which is outside the current range.

Since `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, and `total_sum` is initialized to 0, there are no changes needed for `l`, `k`, or `total_sum` for the next iteration. However, we need to adjust `r` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

To summarize, `r` needs to be adjusted to allow for the next iteration, and `num` should be set to `r + 1`.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is adjusted to `r + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `r + 1`**
