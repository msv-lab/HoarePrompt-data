According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 1`.

Since `l` is defined such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, and `num` is defined as `l + 1`, the current value of `num` is `l + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented to the next integer, which will be `l + 2`. 

Additionally, we need to ensure that `num` remains within the bounds defined by `r`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `num` is `l + 2`, and we must verify that `l + 2` is still less than or equal to `r`. This means we need to adjust `r` to be at least `l + 2` to allow for one more iteration.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, l is such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, num is l + 2, r is at least l + 2**
