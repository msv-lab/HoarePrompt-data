The function accepts an integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns True if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. It correctly handles cases where `n` has fewer unique digits than `k` as well as when `k` is zero, in which case it will only return True if `n` has no unique digits (i.e., `n` is 0).
