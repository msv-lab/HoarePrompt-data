To analyze the code snippet provided, we need to break down the expression and understand how it affects the variable `dp[n, k]`.

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `dp[n, k]` is initially -720.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression being executed is:
     ```
     dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
     ```
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `i - 1` is `2 - 1 = 1`.
     - `k - i` is `3 - 2 = 1`.
   - Therefore, we can rewrite the expression:
     ```
     dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** 1 * (10 ** 1 - 10 ** 1)
     ```
   - This simplifies to:
     ```
     dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (10 - 10)
     ```
   - Since `(10 - 10)` equals `0`, the entire multiplication results in `0`:
     ```
     dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * 0 = 0
     ```
   - Thus, `dp[n, k]` remains unchanged at -720.

3. **Output State**:
   - The value of `dp[n, k]` is still -720, and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is -720, `k` is 3, `i` is 2**
