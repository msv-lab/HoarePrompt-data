Postcondition: ***`s` is a string and `target` is a string. If `s` contains all characters from `target` in order, then `j` is 26, `i` is the length of `s`, and the function prints `target`. If `s` does not contain all characters from `target` in order, then `j` is less than 26, `i` is the length of `s`, and the function prints -1. If `s` is empty or does not match, the loop does not execute, resulting in `i` being 0 and `j` being 0.***
