Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` by replacing each occurrence of the characters 'a' to 'z' in `s` with the next character in the alphabet, and collects these characters in order. If `s` contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value.**
