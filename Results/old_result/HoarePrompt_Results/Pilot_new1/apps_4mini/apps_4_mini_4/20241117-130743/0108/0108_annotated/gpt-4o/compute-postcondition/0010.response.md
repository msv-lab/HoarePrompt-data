Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `i` is less than `len(s)`; `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, indicating a match; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. The value of `j` will be either 1 (if it was originally 0 and a match was found) or 0 (if it was originally 0 and no match was found). If `j` was originally 1, it will be 2 if a match is found, and it will remain 1 if no match is found. Thus, `j` can only take values 0, 1, or 2 after execution, depending on the comparison outcome.***
