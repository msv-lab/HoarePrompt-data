Postcondition: ***If `s` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'z', and `res` is a string consisting of each character in `s` replaced by the next character in the alphabet with a length of 26, the function prints `res`. If `s` does not contain all 26 letters of the alphabet or if `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', `s` remains unchanged, `res` is an empty string, and the function prints -1.***
