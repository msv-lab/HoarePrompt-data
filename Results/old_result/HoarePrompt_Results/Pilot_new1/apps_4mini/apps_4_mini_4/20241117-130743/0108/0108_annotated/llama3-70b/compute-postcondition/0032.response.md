The value of `res` is updated by appending the value of `char`. Since `res` is updated by adding `char` to it, the previous value of `res` is retained and `char` is added to it. The variable `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` with the appended `char`.

Output State: **`res` is updated by appending `char`, `s` contains `chr(ord(char) + 1)`**
