The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1. The values of `s` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1, `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2, `j` is either 0 or 1**
