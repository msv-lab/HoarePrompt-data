To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop operates. The loop will continue as long as both conditions are met: `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`.

1. The variable `i` is currently 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `len(s)` is at least 1. Therefore, as long as `len(s)` is greater than 1, `i` can remain 1 for the next iteration.

2. The variable `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `target_len`, which is 26. If `j` is 0 or 1, this condition is satisfied.

Given that both conditions (`i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`) are satisfied at the end of the previous iteration, we do not need to adjust any states. The loop can indeed execute one more time.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is either 0 or 1**
