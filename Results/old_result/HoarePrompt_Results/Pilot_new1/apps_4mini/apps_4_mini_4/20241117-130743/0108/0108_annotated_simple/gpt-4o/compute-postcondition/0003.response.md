The variables `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0. The values of `s`, `target`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `i` and `j` without affecting any other variables.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
