The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'aa', and `char` is 'b'. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 'aab'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'**
