The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The value of `char` is 'b', so `chr(ord('b') + 1)` gives us 'c'. Since `s` is 'b', the first occurrence of 'b' will be replaced by 'c'. 

After the execution:
- `s` becomes 'c'
- `alphabet`, `res`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'**
