Output State: **`if char is in s then res contains the concatenated occurrences of char from s, and s is updated by replacing the first occurrence of char with the next character in ASCII, and char becomes the next character in the alphabet. If char is not in s initially, the loop does not execute, and both res and s remain unchanged.`**
