According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is confirmed to be in `s`, so the loop can proceed without any modifications. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with `new_char`, and `char` is in `s`**
