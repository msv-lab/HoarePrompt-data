The statement `res += char` appends the value of `char` to `res`. The variable `res` will now contain the previous value of `res` concatenated with `char`. The initial state indicates that `s` remains unchanged, and `char` is a valid character present in `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` after the concatenation, while `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `res` is updated by appending `char`**
