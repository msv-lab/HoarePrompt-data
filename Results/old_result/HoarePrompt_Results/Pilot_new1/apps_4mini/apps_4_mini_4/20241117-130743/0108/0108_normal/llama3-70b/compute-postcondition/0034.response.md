According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has been updated to include `char`, and `s` has been modified to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the character following it in the ASCII table.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `char` must still be present in `s`. Since `s` has been modified, we need to consider that `char` should not have been replaced completely. Therefore, `s` must still contain at least one occurrence of `char`.

State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, and `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`**
