Output State: **`if s contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then j is 26 and i equals len(s) at the end. If s is shorter than 26 characters or does not contain all letters in order, then j is less than 26 and i equals len(s). If s is empty, the loop doesn't execute and both j and i remain 0.**
