`res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'aa', and `char` is 'a', so after execution, `res` becomes 'aaa'. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one 'b' and at least one 'a'; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'aaa'; `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'b' and at least one 'a'; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'aaa'; `char` is 'a'**
