The variable `res` is updated to include `char`, meaning that the value of `char` is appended to `res`. Since the state of `s` and `char` is not directly affected by this operation, we will focus on the change to `res`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` after appending `char`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`**
