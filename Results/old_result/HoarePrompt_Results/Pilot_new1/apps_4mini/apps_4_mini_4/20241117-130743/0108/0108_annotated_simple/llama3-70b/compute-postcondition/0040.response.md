Postcondition: ***`s` contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z', `res` is not equal to the concatenation of all characters from 'a' to 'z', and `res` may be empty or contain a subset of those characters found in `s` in alphabetical order. Additionally, `s` may still contain characters from 'a' to 'z' that were not included in `res`, and may also contain characters outside of 'a' to 'z' which do not affect the state of `res`.***
