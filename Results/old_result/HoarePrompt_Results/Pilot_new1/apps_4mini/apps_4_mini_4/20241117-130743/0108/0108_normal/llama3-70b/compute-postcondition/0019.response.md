The `replace` method is called on the string `s`, which contains 'a' and 'b'. The `char` variable is 'b', and the `replace` method is instructed to replace the first occurrence of 'b' in `s` with the character that comes after 'b' in the ASCII table. The `ord(char)` function gets the ASCII value of 'b', which is 98, and `chr(ord(char) + 1)` converts 99 back to the character 'c'. Thus, the first 'b' in 'ab' is replaced with 'c'. 

After this operation, `s` becomes 'ac', and `res` is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 'ac', `char` is 'b', `res` is updated by appending 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is 'ac', `char` is 'b', `res` is updated by appending 'b'**
