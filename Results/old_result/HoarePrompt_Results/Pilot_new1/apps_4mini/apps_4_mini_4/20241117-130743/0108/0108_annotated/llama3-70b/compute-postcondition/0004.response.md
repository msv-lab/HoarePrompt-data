The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res` concatenated with `char`. Since `res` is initially an empty string and `char` is 'a', after execution, `res` will be 'a'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'a'; `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'a'; `char` is 'a'**
