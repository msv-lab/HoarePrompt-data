Postcondition: ***`res` contains the occurrences of each character from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`. If `res` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', then `s` contains only characters greater than 'z', and the function prints `res`. If `res` does not contain all lowercase letters, it has a length less than 26, and `s` is modified to contain only characters greater than the last character found in `s`. If `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, `res` remains an empty string and `s` remains unchanged, and the function prints -1.***
