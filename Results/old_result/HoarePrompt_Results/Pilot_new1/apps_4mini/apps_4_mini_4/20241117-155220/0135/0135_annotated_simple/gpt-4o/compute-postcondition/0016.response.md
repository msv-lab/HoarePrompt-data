The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case_1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return any value.
- In Case_2, if `k` is at least 1, the function calculates unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, but does not return any value until the next case is fulfilled.
- In Case_3, if certain conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n` and certain conditions are satisfied, it will return 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, or if `k` is less than `n` without fulfilling the conditions for 'Yes', it does not return any value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n` and certain conditions are satisfied, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1 or if `k` is less than `n` without fulfilling the conditions for 'Yes', it does not return any value.**
