Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if `k` is 2 or more after the first iteration of the loop (since the remainder 0 will be found in seen_remainders). If `k` is less than `n` and does not meet these conditions, it returns 'Yes'. Note that if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the function will implicitly return `None`, which is not handled in the annotations.**
