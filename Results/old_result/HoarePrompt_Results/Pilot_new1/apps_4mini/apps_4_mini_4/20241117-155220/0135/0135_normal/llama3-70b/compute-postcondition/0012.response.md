The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops executing. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and 'No' is printed, and the program exits.
