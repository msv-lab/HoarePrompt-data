The code adds `remainder` to the set `seen`. The initial state indicates that `seen` contains 0, and `remainder` can be either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the function would have printed 'No' and exited, but since we are adding `remainder` to `seen`, we need to check its value.

1. If `remainder` is 0, then `seen` already contains 0, and the function would have printed 'No' and exited before this line.
2. If `remainder` is 1, then `seen` does not contain 1, and it will be added to `seen`.

Since the code snippet does not print 'No' or exit, it implies that `remainder` must be 1 in this context. Therefore, the output state reflects that `seen` now contains both 0 and 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains 0 and 1, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 1**
