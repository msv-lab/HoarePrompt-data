The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function prints 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function prints 'No'**
