Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, the function does not return 'No', indicating that the program can continue executing without encountering a previously seen remainder.***
