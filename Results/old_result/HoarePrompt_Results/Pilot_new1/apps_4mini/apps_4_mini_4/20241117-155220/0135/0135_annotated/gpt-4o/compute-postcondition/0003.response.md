The code initializes `seen_remainders` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, and since no return statement is present in this code snippet, we only note the new state of the variable. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
