To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic based on the problem description.

1. The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. It then initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the remainders.
3. The program iterates through all integers `i` from 1 to `k`, calculates `n % i`, and checks if this remainder has already been seen.
4. If a remainder is found in the `seen` set, it prints "No" and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
5. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints "Yes".

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- When `k` is 1, the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always 0. The program correctly handles this case by returning "Yes" since there are no other remainders to compare.
- For larger values of `k`, we need to check if the program properly identifies when remainders are distinct or not.

### Critical Case Analysis:
Let's consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 5`. The remainders would be:
- `5 % 1 = 0`
- `5 % 2 = 1`
- `5 % 3 = 2`
- `5 % 4 = 1` (duplicate found here)
- `5 % 5 = 0` (duplicate found here)

In this case, the program would output "No" because both `5 % 2` and `5 % 4` produce the same remainder of 1, and `5 % 1` and `5 % 5` produce the same remainder of 0.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where multiple values of `i` can produce the same remainder correctly when `k` is larger than or equal to `n`. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that for any `n`, the remainders will start repeating once `i` exceeds `n`.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle scenarios where remainders are not distinct for all values of `i` from 1 to `k`.

Correctness: **False**.
