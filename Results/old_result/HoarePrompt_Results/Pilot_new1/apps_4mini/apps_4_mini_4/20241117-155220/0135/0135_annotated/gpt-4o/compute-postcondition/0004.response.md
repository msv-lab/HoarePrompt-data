According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`, inclusive. Since `k` is a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will run at least once because `k` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `k`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the initial state of `i` should be set to 1, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set as it does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
