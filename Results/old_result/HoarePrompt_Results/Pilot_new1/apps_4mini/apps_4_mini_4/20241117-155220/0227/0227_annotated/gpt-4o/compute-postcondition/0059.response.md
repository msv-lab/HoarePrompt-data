The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the next element in `assigned` after the current one, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
