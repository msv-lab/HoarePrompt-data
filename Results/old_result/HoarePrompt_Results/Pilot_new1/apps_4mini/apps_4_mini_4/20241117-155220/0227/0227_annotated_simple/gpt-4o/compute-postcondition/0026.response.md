The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `assigned`, `m`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `can_form` is now `False`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`assigned` now contains the element `a[i + 1]`, `m` has been increased by 1 if it wasn't changed since the last check, and `n`, `i`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged; `can_form` is False**.
