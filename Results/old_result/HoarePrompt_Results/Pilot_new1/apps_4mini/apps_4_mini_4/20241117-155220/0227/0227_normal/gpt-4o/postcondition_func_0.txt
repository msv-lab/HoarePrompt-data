The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and counts how many unique elements cannot be formed by the differences between previously assigned elements. If `n` is 1, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count of unique elements that cannot be formed by the differences of previously assigned elements in the list.
