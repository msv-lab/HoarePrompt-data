The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, which means it remains `True`. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned`**
