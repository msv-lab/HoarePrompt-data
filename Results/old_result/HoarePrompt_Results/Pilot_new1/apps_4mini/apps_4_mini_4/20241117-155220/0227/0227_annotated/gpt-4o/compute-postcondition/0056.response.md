Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, the loop or if statement is exited immediately. If this condition is not met, the program continues without changing the state of `can_form`, `m`, or `assigned`.***
