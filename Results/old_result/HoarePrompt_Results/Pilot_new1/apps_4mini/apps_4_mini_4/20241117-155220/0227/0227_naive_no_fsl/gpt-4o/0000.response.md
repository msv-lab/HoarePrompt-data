To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have a sequence of distinct positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. We need to perform a series of operations that involve assigning values to variables `b_1, b_2, ..., b_m` where initially all variables are set to zero.
3. The first operation assigns `a_1` to some variable `b_x`, and subsequent operations must assign values that are sums of previously assigned variables, matching the values in the list `a`.

### Program Logic:
- The program starts by sorting the array `a`, which is unnecessary since the order of operations matters.
- It initializes a set `assigned` to keep track of values that have been assigned to the variables.
- It iterates through each value in `a` (after the first one) and checks if the current value can be formed by summing any two previously assigned values.
- If it cannot be formed, it increments `m` (the count of variables used) and adds the current value to the `assigned` set.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Sorting of `a`**: The program sorts `a`, which changes the order of operations. The ability to form a number from previous sums depends on the order in which numbers are processed. Sorting could lead to incorrect results.
2. **Edge Cases**: The logic does not handle the case when the sum of two smallest elements might not equal the required next element. For instance, if the sequence contains `1, 2, 3, 6`, the program would work, but if we had `1, 2, 4`, it would fail since `4` cannot be formed by any sums of `1` and `2`.
3. **Output of -1**: The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to complete the sequence correctly. It should return `-1` if the operations cannot be performed with any number of variables.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 4 8 16
```
- The program would sort this to `1, 2, 4, 8, 16`.
- It would incorrectly conclude that it can perform the operations with just two variables, but in reality, you cannot form `4` from `1` and `2` because you need an additional variable to store `2` before you can sum it with `1` to get `3`.

### Conclusion:
Due to the sorting of the sequence and the failure to account for the impossibility of forming certain numbers, the program does not adhere to the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
