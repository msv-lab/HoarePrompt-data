Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains at least two elements, `i + 1` is a valid index for `a`, and `m` and `n` remain unchanged. If the value of `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` retains its previous value, and the program continues without any changes to `m` or `n`.***
