The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer \(a_k\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_k \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns the count of elements in the list `a` that could not be formed from the differences, denoted as `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a`, and return the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed from the differences. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`, and returns the count of elements in `a` that could not be formed from the differences.**
