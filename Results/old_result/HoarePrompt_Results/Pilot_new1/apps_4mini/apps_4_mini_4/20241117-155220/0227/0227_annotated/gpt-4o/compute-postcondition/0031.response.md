Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, which means that the condition for forming has been met, and `m` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, `m` remains increased by 1, and the execution continues past this point without breaking out of the loop.***
