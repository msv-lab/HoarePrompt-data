The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least three distinct integers, `m` is 1, `x` is one of the elements in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
