The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and since `m` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 2**
