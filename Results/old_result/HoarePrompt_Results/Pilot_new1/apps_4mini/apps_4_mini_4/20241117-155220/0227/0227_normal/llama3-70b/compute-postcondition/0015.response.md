Output State: **`m` represents the count of elements in the list `a` that are not equal to double the previous element. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop executes `n-1` times, and `m` will be at least 1 (initial value). If all elements satisfy the condition `a[i] == a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` remains 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains 1. Therefore, `m` can range from 1 to `n` depending on the values in the list `a`.**
