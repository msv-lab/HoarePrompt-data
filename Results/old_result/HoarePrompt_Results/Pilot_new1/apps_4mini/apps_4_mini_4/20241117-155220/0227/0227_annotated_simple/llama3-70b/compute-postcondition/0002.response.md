The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n` and the elements of `a` are not affected by the sorting operation itself, but the order of the elements in `a` changes. The initial state indicates that `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and the sorting operation will arrange these integers from the smallest to the largest. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorted order of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9 based on user input**
