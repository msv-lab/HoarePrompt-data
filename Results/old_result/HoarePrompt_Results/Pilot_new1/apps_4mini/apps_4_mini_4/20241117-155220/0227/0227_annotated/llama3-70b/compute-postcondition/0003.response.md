The variable `m` is assigned the value `1`. The previous state of the other variables is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is 1**
