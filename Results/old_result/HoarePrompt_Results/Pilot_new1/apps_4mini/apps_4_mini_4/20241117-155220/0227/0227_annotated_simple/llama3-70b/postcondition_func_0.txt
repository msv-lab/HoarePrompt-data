The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list `a` are not double the previous element. If the count is less than or equal to 23, it prints that count; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 1, the function will always print 1 since there are no elements to compare against. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or where the input values do not meet the specified constraints.
