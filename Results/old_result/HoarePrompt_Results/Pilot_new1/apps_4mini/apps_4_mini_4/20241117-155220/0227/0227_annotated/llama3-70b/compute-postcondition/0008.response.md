According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and will iterate while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently 1, and since `n` is at least 2, `i` can be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being incremented to 2.

The variable `m` does not affect the loop condition, but it is noted that `m` is 2 if `a[1]` is not equal to `a[0] * 2`, or remains 1 if it is equal. However, since the loop condition is based solely on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where `n` is at least 2, `m` is 2, `i` is 2**
