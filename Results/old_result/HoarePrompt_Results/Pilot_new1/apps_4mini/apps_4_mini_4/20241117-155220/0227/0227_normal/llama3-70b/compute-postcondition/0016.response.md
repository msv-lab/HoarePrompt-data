The code checks the value of `m` and prints `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. Since `m` represents the count of elements in the list `a` that are not equal to double the previous element, it can range from 1 to `n`. The exact value of `m` is not provided, but we know it is at least 1.

If `m` is less than or equal to 23, it will be printed. If `m` is greater than 23, -1 will be printed. Therefore, depending on the actual value of `m`, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`m` is either between 1 and 23 (inclusive) and printed, or `m` is greater than 23 and -1 is printed.**
