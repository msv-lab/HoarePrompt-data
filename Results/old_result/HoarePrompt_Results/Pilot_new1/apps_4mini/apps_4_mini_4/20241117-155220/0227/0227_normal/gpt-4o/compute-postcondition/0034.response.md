The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `n` remains at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in `assigned, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
