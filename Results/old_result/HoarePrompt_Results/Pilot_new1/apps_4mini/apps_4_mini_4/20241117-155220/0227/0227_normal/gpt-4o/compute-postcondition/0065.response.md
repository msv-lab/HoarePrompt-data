Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, if `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1, making `m` at least 4. The variable `assigned` contains at least one element, and `i` is 2. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop executes but may not find a valid `x`, leaving `can_form` as False.***
