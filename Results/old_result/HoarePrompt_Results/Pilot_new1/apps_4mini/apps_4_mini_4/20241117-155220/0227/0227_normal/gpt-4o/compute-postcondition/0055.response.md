The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains at least 3, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
