To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have a sequence of distinct positive integers.
2. We need to perform a series of operations using a minimum number of variables.
3. The first operation assigns the first number in the sequence to a variable.
4. Subsequent operations assign sums of previously assigned variables to new variables, ensuring that the assigned values match the sequence.
5. We need to find the minimum number of variables required or return -1 if it's impossible.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. The input is read and stored in a list `a`, which is sorted.
2. The variable `m` is initialized to 1, representing the minimum number of variables needed.
3. The code iterates through the sorted list starting from the second element. If the current element is not double the previous element, it increments `m`.
4. Finally, it checks if `m` is less than or equal to 23 and prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for incrementing `m` is based solely on checking if each element is double the previous one. However, this does not account for all possible sequences of operations that might be required to form the given sequence.
- The requirement that the assigned values must match the sequence is not fully addressed. There can be cases where the sequence cannot be formed using the current logic.
  
### Test Cases:
Let's consider a few test cases to check if the program handles all scenarios correctly.

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `3\n3 6 5`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - The program correctly identifies that it cannot form the sequence since 5 cannot be formed by doubling or summing previous variables.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5\n1 2 3 6 8`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program should be able to form the sequence correctly and would return 2.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6\n2 4 8 6 10 18`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The program should return 3, which it does.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4\n1 2 3 7`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - The program does not account for cases where a number cannot be formed from the previous variables. Here, 7 cannot be formed from 1, 2, or 3.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where the sequence cannot be formed due to the constraints of summing previous variables. Therefore, it fails for sequences where the required operations cannot be performed.

Correctness: **False**
