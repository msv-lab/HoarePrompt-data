Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `m` is 1 initially. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is incremented by 1, resulting in `m` being 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` remains 1. Thus, after execution, `m` will be either 1 or 2 depending on the comparison of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1] * 2`. Additionally, since `a` contains distinct positive integers, the condition will not lead to any edge cases concerning duplicates or non-positive integers.***
