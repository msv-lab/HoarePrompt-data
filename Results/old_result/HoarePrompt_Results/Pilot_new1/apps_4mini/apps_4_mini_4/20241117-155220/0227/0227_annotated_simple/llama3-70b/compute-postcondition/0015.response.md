Output State: **If n is at least 2, m is equal to the count of elements in a that are not double the previous element, starting from 1. If n is 1, the loop does not execute and m remains 1. If a is sorted and contains distinct integers, m will be at least 1 and at most n. If all elements satisfy the condition a[i] = a[i - 1] * 2, then m remains 1.**
