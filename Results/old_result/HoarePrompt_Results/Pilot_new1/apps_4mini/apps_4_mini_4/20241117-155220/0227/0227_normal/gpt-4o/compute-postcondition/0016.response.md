The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is [a[0], a[1], a[2]], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a[1], and `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is [a[0], a[1], a[2]], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a[1], and `can_form` is True**
