Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of variables `m` needed to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem statement. 

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Variables**: The program increments `m` whenever the current value `a[i]` is not double the previous value `a[i - 1]`. This approach does not accurately reflect the conditions under which the variables can be used to generate the required sums. The actual requirement is to ensure that each `a[t]` can be formed as a sum of previously assigned variables, not just by checking if it's double the previous one.

2. **Failure to Handle Cases Where Operations Cannot Be Performed**: The program does not check whether it is possible to perform the required operations with the given values. For example, if the sequence contains numbers that cannot be formed by summing any combination of previously defined variables, the program should return `-1`, but it does not account for this scenario.

### Example Input Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The expected output is `-1` because it's impossible to create the number `5` using the previous numbers `3` and `6` through any combinations of summing the variables. However, the provided program would incorrectly calculate the number of variables needed.

Due to these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
