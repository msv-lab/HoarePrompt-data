The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, and the list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` based on user input while maintaining the state of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9**
