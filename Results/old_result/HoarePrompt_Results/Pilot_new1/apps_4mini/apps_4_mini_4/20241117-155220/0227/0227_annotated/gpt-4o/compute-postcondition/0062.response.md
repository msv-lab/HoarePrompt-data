Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, and `i` is 1 or 2 depending on the iteration. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, and `assigned` still includes `a[n-1]`.**
