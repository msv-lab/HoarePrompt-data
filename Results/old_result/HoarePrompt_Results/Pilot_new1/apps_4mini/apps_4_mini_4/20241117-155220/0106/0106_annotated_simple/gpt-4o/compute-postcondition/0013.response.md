The function `func_1` accepts the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. Additionally, `a` and `b` are distinct integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. After executing the function body, it returns the total time calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, and returns the total time calculated as the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
