Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are input integers; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` and `b_block` are dependent on an undefined variable `b`, thus cannot be calculated. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is computed as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is computed as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In both cases, since `b_floor` is undefined, `min_floor_time` cannot be definitively calculated, leading to uncertainty in the final value.***
