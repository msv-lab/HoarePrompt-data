The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` numbers based on the apartment number's position in a building layout defined by parameters `m` (number of floors per block) and `k` (number of apartments per floor). It returns a tuple containing the calculated `block` and `floor`. However, the function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are zero, which could lead to division by zero errors.
