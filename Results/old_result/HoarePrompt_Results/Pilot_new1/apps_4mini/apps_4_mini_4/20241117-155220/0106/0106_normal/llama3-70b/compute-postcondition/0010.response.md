The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned the value of `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. However, `b_floor` is dependent on the undefined variable `b`, which means `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are input integers; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is dependent on an undefined variable `b`; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` cannot be calculated.
