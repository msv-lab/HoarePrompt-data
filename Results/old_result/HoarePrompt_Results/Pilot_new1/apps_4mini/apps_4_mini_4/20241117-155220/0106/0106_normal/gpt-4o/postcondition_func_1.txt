The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` in a building layout based on the apartment number. It returns a tuple containing these values. Note that the function assumes `m` and `k` are defined globally, which may lead to errors if they are not initialized. Additionally, if `apartment` is less than 1, the calculations may yield unexpected results, as the function does not handle negative or zero apartment numbers.
