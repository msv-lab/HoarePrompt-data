To determine the output state, we will analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state includes values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` that are assigned from input.
2. The calculations for `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` are based on the values of `a` and `b` as follows:
   - `a_floor` = (a - 1) % m + 1
   - `a_block` = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
   - `b_floor` = (b - 1) % m + 1
   - `b_block` = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
3. The code snippet calculates `min_block_time` using the formula:
   - `min_block_time` = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute numerical values for `a_block`, `b_block`, or `min_block_time`. However, we can express the relationships and calculations based on the initial state.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_block`, `b_block`, and the calculated `min_block_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input; `a`, `b` are the two integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15**
