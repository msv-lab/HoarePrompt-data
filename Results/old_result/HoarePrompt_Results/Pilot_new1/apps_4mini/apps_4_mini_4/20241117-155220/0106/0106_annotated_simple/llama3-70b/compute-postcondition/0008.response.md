Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` and `b` are integers assigned from input; `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated values; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10.**
