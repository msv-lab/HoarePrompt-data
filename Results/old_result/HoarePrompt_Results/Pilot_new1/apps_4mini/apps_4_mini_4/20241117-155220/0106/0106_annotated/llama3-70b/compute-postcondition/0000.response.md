The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which is split and converted to integers. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, their exact values will depend on the user input. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input, and `a`, `b` remain distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.**
