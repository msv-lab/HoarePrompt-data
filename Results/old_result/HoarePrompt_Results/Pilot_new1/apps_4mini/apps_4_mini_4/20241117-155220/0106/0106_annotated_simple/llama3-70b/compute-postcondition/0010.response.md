The value of `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the difference between `b_floor` and `a_floor`. The formula used is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `b_floor`, `a_block`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` are not directly affected by this calculation, but `min_floor_time` is now defined based on the existing values of `b_floor` and `a_floor`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this new calculation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers; `a` and `b` are integers; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**
