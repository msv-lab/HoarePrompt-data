The variable `block` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `m` and `k` are positive integers, and `apartment` is a distinct integer representing an apartment number within the range given. The calculation of `block` depends on the specific value of `apartment`, which is not provided, but the formula will yield a positive integer since `m` and `k` are positive integers.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `block` based on the calculated value, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
