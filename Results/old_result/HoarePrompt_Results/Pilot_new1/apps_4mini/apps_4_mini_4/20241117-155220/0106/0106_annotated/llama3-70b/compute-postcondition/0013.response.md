The function `func` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are distinct integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function's behavior based on these inputs is not described in detail, but it will process these parameters according to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers), and a, b (distinct integers), and processes them based on the given constraints.**
