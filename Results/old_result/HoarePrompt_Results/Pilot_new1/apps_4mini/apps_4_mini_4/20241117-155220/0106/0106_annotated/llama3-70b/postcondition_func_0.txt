The function accepts five integers: `n`, `m`, `k` (which are derived from the first input line), and `a`, `b` (which are derived from the second input line). It calculates the minimum time required to traverse blocks and floors between two points `a` and `b` based on their respective block and floor positions. The function prints the total time, which is the sum of the time required to move between blocks and the time required to move between floors. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input values are not valid integers or if `a` and `b` are not distinct.
