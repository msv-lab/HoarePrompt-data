According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions of `d_queue` and `r_queue`. The loop can execute again as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `d_queue` and `r_queue` have one less element each. This means that both queues must have had at least one element before the last iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must have at least one element remaining. Since they both had one less element, they must have originally had at least 2 elements each before the last iteration. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that both queues currently have at least 1 element.

State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element, `r_queue` has at least 1 element**
