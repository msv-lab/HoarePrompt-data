Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` followed by a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the votes in a way that simulates a competition between the two characters. The function maintains two queues for the indices of 'D' and 'R' votes. It repeatedly compares the indices from both queues and appends the index of the character that appears first back into its queue after a set number of rounds. The process continues until one of the queues is empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is non-empty, or 'R' if the 'R' queue is non-empty. If `n` is 0 (i.e., an empty string for votes), the function will not perform any operations and will not print anything.**
