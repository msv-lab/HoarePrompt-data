The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The variables `d_index` and `n` are integers, but their specific values are not provided. The state of `r_index` and `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that a new element has been added to `d_queue`, but the specific values of `d_index` and `n` are unknown.

Output State: **`d_index` is an integer, `r_index` is an integer, `d_queue` is a modified queue with elements after removing the first element and now has an additional element `d_index + n`, `r_queue` is a modified queue with elements after removing the first element, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.**
