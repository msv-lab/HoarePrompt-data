The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `d_queue` is newly created, it starts as an empty list. The other variables, `n` and `votes`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list**
