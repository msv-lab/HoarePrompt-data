The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The initial state indicates that `r_index` was originally the first element of `r_queue`, and now it will be updated to the value of the first element before it is removed. The second element of `d_queue` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`d_index` is the second element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `r_index` is updated to the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it is removed.**
