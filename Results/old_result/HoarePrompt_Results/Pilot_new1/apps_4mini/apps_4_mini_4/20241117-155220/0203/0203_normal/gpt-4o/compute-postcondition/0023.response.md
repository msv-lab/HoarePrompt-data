The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The current state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element, and `r_queue` is one element smaller, but the exact values of `d_index` and `n` are not provided. However, since `d_index` is known to be less than `r_index`, we can conclude that `d_index + n` will yield a new value that will be added to `d_queue`.

The states of `r_queue` and `r_index` are not affected by this operation, and the only change occurs in `d_queue`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new element added to `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (which is `d_index + n`), `r_queue` is one element smaller, `r_index` is the value of the popped element from `r_queue`, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.**
