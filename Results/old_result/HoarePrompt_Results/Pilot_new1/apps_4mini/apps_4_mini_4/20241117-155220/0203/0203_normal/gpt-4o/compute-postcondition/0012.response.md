The value of `i` is `n - 1`, which is a non-negative integer since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is a list, `r_queue` now contains the value `i`, and `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is a list, `r_queue` now contains the value `i`, and `i` is `n - 1**
