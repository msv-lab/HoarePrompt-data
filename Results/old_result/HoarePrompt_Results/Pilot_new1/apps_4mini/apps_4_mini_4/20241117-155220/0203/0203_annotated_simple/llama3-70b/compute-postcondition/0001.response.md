The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as the input operation does not affect its value. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string**
