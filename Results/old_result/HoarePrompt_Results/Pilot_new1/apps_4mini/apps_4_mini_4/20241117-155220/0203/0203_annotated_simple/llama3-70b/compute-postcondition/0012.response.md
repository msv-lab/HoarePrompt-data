The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `fraction`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the next character in the string, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the next character in the string, and `remocrats` is increased by 1**
