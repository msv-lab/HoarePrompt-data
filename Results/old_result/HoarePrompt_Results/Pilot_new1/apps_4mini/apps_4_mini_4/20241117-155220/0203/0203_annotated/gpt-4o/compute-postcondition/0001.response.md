The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state indicates that `votes` is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. Since the input is taken from the user, the specific value of `votes` will depend on that input. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change to `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', updated to the user input after stripping whitespace.**
