The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of votes and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the indices of 'D' and 'R' votes, simulating a voting process where the indices are compared in a loop until one of the queues is empty. The function prints 'D' if there are remaining 'D' votes, 'R' if there are remaining 'R' votes, and does not handle the case of a tie, which is a potential missing functionality. If no votes are provided, 'R' is printed by default.
