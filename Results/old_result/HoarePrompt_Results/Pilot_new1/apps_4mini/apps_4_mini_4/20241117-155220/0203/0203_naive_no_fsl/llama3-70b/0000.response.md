Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the voting logic as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) and declares the winner based on which count is higher. However, the problem states that the voting process is dynamic, with employees being able to deny others the right to vote based on the order of statements. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5
DRDRD
```

In this case, the first employee (D) can deny the second employee (R), and then the second employee (R) can deny the fourth employee (R). The process continues, and it is possible for the depublicans to ensure that they are the last remaining voter. The program, however, does not account for this dynamic interaction and simply assumes that the outcome can be determined by counting the initial votes, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to account for the complex interactions of the voting process, leading to incorrect outcomes in certain scenarios.
