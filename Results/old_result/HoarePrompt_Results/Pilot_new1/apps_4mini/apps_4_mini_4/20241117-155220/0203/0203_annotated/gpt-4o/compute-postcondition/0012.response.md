The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the `r_queue`. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `r_queue` and the unchanged `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `d_queue` will contain the index `0` if the second character of `votes` (`v`) is 'D', otherwise `d_queue` will be empty; `r_queue` now contains the index `1`; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character of `votes`.**
