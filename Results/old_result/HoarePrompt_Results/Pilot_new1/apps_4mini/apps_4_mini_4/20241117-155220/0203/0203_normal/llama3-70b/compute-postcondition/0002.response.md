The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. Since there are no other operations affecting `n` or `fractions`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 0**
