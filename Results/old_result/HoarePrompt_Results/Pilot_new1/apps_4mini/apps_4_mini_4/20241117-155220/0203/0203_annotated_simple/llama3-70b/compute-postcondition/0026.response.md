Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input `n` (which is the length of the following string) and a string `fractions` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D' characters is greater than that of 'R' characters, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `fractions` is an empty string (which can happen if `n` is 0), the function will still print 'R' since there are no 'D' characters. The function does not return any value.**
