The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
