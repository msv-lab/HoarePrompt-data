The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), but the exact value of `n` after the input is not specified. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000)**
