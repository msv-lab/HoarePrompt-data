Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string with at least 2 characters. If the current character being processed is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 (resulting in at least 2 if it was initially 1), and `remocrats` remains unchanged. If the current character is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 (resulting in at least 1 if it was initially 0), and `depublicans` remains unchanged.***
