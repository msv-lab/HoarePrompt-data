The variable `r_queue` is assigned an empty list. The initial state of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
