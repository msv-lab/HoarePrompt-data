The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one, and `depublicans` is increased by 1**
