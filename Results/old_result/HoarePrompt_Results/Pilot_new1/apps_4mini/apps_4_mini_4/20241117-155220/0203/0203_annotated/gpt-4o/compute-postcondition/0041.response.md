Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is a non-empty queue, `r_queue` can be either empty or non-empty, and both queues have been modified by removing their first elements and potentially adding either `d_index + n` or `r_index + n` based on their comparison. If `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are empty before the loop starts, but since the if condition is satisfied, `d_queue` must contain elements.***
