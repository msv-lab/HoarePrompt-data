The code executes a print statement that outputs the character 'R'. The state of the variables `depublicans` and `remocrats` remains unchanged, as the print statement does not alter them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates the printed output.

Output State: **`depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are non-negative integers; printed output is 'R'**
