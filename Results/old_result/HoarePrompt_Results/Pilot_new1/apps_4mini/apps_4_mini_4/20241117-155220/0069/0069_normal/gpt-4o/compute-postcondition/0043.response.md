The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` retrieves a value from the `data` list at the position specified by `index`, and `int` converts that value to an integer. The other variables (`balance`, `x`, `results`, and `T`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the newly assigned value of `n`.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` reflects the last appended value, `T` is greater than `current_iteration`, and `n` is int(data[index])**
