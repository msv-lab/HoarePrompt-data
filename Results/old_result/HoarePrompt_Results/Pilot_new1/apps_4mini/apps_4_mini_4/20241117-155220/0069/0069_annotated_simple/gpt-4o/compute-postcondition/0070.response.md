The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and the loop will start over with `b` being the first element in the list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and the loop will start over with `b` being the first element in the list.**
