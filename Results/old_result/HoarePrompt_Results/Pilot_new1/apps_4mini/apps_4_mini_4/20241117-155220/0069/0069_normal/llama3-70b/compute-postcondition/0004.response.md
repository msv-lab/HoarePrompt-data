`cnt0` is assigned the value of the count of '0' characters in the string `s`, and `cnt1` is assigned the value of the count of '1' characters in the string `s`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s**
