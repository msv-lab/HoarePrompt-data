The `print(result)` statement outputs the value of `result`, which is the third element in the `results` list. The initial state indicates that `results` contains at least 3 elements, so `result` has a valid value. The other variables (`index`, `T`, and `n`) are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and includes the printed value of `result`.

Output State: **`results` contains at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the function prints the value of `result`**.
