The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The state of the other variables, including `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `n`, and `T`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been added to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums, `balance` is 0, `n` is at least 1 or less, `T` remains greater than 0, and `results` now contains -1.**
