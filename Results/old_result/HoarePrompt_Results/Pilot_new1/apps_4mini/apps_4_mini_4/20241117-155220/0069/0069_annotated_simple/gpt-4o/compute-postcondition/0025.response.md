Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0; `balance` is 0; if `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1`; otherwise, if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes an additional element `0`.***
