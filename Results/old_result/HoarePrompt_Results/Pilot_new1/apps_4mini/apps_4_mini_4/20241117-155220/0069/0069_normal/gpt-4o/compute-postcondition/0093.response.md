Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums calculated based on the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the number of '0's minus the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 initialized to all zeros. Additionally, `T` remains greater than 0 throughout the execution as long as it is initially greater than the current iteration count.**
