Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums with at least 1 element, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `n` is less than 1, `T` is greater than 0, and `count` remains unchanged at 1 unless `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, in which case `count` is increased to 2.***
