The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `s`, `data`, `results`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of substrings from input, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of substrings from input, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])**
