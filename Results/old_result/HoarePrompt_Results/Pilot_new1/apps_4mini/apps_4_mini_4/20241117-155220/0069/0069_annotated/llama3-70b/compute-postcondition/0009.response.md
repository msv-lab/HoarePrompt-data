Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by the difference `(cnt0 - cnt1)`***
