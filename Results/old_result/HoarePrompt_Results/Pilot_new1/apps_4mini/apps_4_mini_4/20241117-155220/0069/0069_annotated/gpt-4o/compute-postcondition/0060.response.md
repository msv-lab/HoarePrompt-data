Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums of '0's and '1's up to index `n`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is assigned a value that is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `index` is increased by 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, then `prefix_balances[i]` reflects the cumulative balance at index `i`, which is either incremented or decremented based on the character in `s[i - 1]`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
