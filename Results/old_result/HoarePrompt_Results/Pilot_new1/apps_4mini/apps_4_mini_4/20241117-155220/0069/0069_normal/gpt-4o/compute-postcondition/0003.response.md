The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` contains the entire input read from standard input, `data` is a list of substrings derived from that input, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `index` is 1.

Output State: **`input` contains the entire input read from standard input, `data` is a list of substrings derived from that input, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `index` is 1**
