Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `n` is 0, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and `x` is an integer. If the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient of this difference divided by `balance` is non-negative, then `count` is increased by 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
