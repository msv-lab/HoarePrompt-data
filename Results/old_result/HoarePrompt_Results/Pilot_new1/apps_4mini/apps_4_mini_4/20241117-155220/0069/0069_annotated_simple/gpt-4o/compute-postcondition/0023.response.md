Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0. The value of `balance` is 0, indicating that the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring is equal. `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and if `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times with `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1.`***
