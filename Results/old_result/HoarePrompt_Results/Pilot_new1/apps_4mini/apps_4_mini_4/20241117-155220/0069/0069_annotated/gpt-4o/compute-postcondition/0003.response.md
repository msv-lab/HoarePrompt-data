The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the state of `data` and `T` remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `index` is 1.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `index` is 1**
