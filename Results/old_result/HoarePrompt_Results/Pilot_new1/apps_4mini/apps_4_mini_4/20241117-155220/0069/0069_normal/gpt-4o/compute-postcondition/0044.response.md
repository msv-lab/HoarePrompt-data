The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. The other variables `balance`, `results`, `T`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `x` without specifying its value.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is int(data[index + 1]), `results` reflects the last appended value, `T` is greater than `current_iteration`, `n` is int(data[index])**
