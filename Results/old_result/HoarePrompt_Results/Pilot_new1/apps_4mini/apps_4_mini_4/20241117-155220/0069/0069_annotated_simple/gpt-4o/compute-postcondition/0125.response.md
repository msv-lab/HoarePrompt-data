Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, `results` contains the outcomes based on the balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, and the loop will execute for each element in `results`, printing each `result`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains unchanged (potentially empty), while `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.**
