According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n` (since the range is from 1 to `n + 1`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 to ensure that the loop can run again, since if `n` were exactly 2, the next value of `i` (which would be 3) would exceed `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 2, 0, or -2 based on the values of `prefix_balances[1]` and `s[i - 1]`; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `i` is 3; `n` is at least 3**
