Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the output is -1, indicating that `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is undefined. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of adjustments needed to reach the desired balance. This covers scenarios where `balance` matches `x`, where the counts of '0's and '1's are equal, and where both counts differ, ensuring all edge cases are addressed.***
