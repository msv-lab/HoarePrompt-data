The value of `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The variable `n` is not directly affected by this assignment, but it is noted that `n` has a value retrieved from `data[index]`. The output state reflects that `x` now holds the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, while `T` remains greater than the current iteration count.

Output State: **`T` is greater than the current iteration count; `n` is the integer value retrieved from `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]**
