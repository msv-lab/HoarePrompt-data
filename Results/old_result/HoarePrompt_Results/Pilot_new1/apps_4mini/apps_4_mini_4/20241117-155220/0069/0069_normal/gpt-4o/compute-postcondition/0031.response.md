Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` is 0. If `(x - b)` is non-negative and divisible by `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If `(x - b)` is negative or not divisible by `balance`, then `count` remains 0.***
