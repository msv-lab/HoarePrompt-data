Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the sum of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0', otherwise -1. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, and `prefix_balances` will have values based on the characters in `s`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains initialized with 0s.**
