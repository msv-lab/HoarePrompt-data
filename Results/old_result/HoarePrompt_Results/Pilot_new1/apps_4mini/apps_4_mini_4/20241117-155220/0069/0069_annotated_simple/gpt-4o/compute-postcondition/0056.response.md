Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the net count of '0's and '1's in the first `i` characters of string `s`. If `s` has a length of 0 (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains as a list of zeros. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` based on the characters in `s`. Specifically, `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative sum where '0' increments the value and any other character decrements it.**
