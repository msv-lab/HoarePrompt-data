Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`; `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`; `results` contains at least two elements including one `-1` and one `0`; `T` remains greater than the current iteration count; `index` is increased by 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 1; `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
