Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is initially 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented to 2. If the condition is not met, `count` remains 1.***
