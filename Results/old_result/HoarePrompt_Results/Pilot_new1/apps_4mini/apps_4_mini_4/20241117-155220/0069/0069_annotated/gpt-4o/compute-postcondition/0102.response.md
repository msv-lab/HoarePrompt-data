According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. If `prefix_balances` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `count` is 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop. However, we need to ensure that `b` can take on the first value in `prefix_balances`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `prefix_balances` must contain at least one cumulative difference, and `b` should be set to the first element of `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` contains at least one element, `count` is 0, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`**
