According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `prefix_balances`. If `prefix_balances` contains at least three elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` contains at least two elements, and `b` is the second element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `prefix_balances` must contain at least three elements, and `b` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` contains at least three elements, `b` is the third element in the list**
