Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `n` is 1, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, and `x` is an integer. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`, `count` remains unchanged.***
