Output State: **`results` contains the outcomes based on the balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing cumulative balances. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` will have `-1`. If `x` is not found, `results` will have `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of indices in `prefix_balances` where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, which is appended to `results`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, and no elements are added to `results`.**
