According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` ranging from 1 to `n + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

Since the loop is defined to run until `i` reaches `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again. The current state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, which is consistent with `i` being 2 at the end of the last iteration. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` should be updated to 3. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is not specified to change in this context. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 3; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2 based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]`.**
