Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 99), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the printed output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the printed output is -1. Otherwise, the printed output is calculated as ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1), which accounts for the difference between `x` and `balance` divided by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, ensuring that both cases where `cnt0` is greater than `cnt1` and where `cnt1` is greater than `cnt0` are handled.***
