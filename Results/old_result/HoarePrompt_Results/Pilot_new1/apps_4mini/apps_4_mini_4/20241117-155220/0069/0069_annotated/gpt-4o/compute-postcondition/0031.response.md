Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, then if the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the difference is not a non-negative multiple of `balance`, `count` remains 0.***
