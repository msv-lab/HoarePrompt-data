The code assigns the value of `a` to be the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes input from the user, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The previous state indicates that `n` is an input integer and `a` is currently a list of `n` distinct integers. The new value of `a` will be determined by the input provided by the user, which should consist of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`. 

Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is now the list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is now the list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user**
