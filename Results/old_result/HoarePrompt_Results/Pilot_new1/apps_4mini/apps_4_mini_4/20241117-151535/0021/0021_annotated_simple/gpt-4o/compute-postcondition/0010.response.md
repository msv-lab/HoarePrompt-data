The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`, representing a permutation of size `n`. After executing the function body, it processes the permutation and returns a result based on its logic. However, the specific output is not provided in the information given. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n), representing a permutation of size `n`.**
