The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The variables `n` and `min_pos` are already defined in the initial state. 

- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`.

Since `dist4` is calculated using these values, it will depend on the specific values of `n` and `min_pos`. 

Thus, after executing the code, the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `min_pos`, and `dist4`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`**
