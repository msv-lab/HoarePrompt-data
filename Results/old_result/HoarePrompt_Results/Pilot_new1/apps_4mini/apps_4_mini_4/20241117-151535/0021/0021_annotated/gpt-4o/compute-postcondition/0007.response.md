The code attempts to calculate `dist4` using the variable `min_pos`, which is currently undefined. Since `min_pos` has not been assigned any value, the calculation of `dist4` cannot be completed. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the situation where `min_pos` is undefined, and `dist4` cannot be calculated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `min_pos` is undefined, thus `dist3` cannot be calculated; `dist4` cannot be calculated due to undefined `min_pos`.**
