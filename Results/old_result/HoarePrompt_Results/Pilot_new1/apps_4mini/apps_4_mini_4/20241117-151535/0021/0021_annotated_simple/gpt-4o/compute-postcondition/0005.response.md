To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables based on the initial state.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input.
   - `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`.
   - `max_pos` is the index of integer `n` in `a`.
   - `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)` calculates the absolute value of the expression \( n - 1 - \text{max_pos} \) and assigns it to `dist2`.

3. **Variable Values**:
   - `n` is known to be an integer within the specified range.
   - `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`, which is a valid index based on the distinct integers.

4. **Calculation**:
   - The value of `dist2` is computed using the formula \( \text{dist2} = |n - 1 - \text{max_pos}| \).

Since `max_pos` is a valid index in the range of `0` to `n-1`, the output state will reflect the computed value of `dist2` along with the other variables that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of integer n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to max_pos; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**.
