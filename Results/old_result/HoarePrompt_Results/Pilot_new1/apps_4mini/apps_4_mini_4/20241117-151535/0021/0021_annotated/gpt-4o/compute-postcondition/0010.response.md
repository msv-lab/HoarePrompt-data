The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers that contains all integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns an output based on the conditions specified in the function body.

However, the output details were not provided in your prompt. To describe the functionality accurately, I would need the specific output behavior of the function based on the input parameters.

Assuming a hypothetical output behavior, I can provide a general functionality description. If you can provide the output behavior, I can refine the description accordingly.

For now, based on the provided constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`.**
