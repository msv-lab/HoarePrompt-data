The code assigns the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)` to `dist2`. Given that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, we can calculate `dist2` based on these values.

`dist2` will be the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. The specific values of `n` and `max_pos` are not provided, but we know their constraints. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship between these variables without specifying exact numerical values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
