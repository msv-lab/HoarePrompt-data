The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers that contains all integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on them. However, the exact nature of the output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers that include all integers from 1 to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (between 2 and 100) and a list a of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n.**
