The code assigns `max_pos` the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an input integer and is guaranteed to be within the range of the values in `a`, `max_pos` will be the index where `n` is located in `a`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is the list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is the list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
