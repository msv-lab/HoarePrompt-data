To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

The problem states that we need to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers.

2. **Finding Positions**:
   - It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) using `a.index(1)` and `a.index(n)`.

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   - The program calculates `max_dist` as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
   - It calculates `min_dist` as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`.

### Issues Identified

The logic of the program has a flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible distance after one swap. Specifically:
- The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` does not correctly account for the positions of the elements after a swap.
- The formula used does not guarantee that the swap will actually lead to the maximum distance between the two elements. The distance should be calculated based on the potential positions after a swap, rather than just the existing positions.

### Test Case to Illustrate the Problem

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
4
1 4 3 2
```
- Here, the minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (4) is at index 1.
- The current distance is `abs(0 - 1) = 1`.
- If we swap 1 with 2 (index 3), we would have: `2 4 3 1`, and the distance becomes `abs(3 - 1) = 2`.
- The expected output should be 2, but the program may not calculate this correctly due to its flawed logic in distance calculation.

### Conclusion

Due to the identified flaw and the potential for incorrect outputs based on the logic of the program, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
