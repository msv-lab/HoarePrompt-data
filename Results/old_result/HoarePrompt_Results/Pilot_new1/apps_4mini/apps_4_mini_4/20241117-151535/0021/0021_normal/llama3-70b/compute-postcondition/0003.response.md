The value of `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer within the range of 2 to 100 and `a` contains distinct integers based on user input, the output state will reflect the index of `n` in `a`. The previous values of `n` and `a` are relevant here, but since `pos1` is not affected by this operation, it will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.**
