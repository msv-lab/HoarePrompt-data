To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nicholas has an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. He wants to maximize the distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements by performing exactly one swap.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations are generally correct, as they describe the logic of finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and calculating potential distances to the ends of the array.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads the size of the permutation `n` and the permutation itself.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n).
3. It calculates the distances from both the minimum and maximum elements to the two ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1).
4. It then takes the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Potential Edge Cases:
Let's consider the edge cases:

1. **Case with n = 2**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     2
     1 2
     ```
     - Minimum and maximum are already at the ends. The maximum distance is `1`, but swapping doesn't change the positions.
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (correct)

2. **Case where the minimum and maximum are already at the ends**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     5
     1 3 4 2 5
     ```
     - Minimum is at index 0, maximum is at index 4. The maximum distance is `4`.
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Actual Output: `4` (correct)

3. **Case where the minimum and maximum are in the middle**:
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     3 1 4 2 5
     ```
     - Minimum is at index 1, maximum is at index 4. The maximum distance would be achieved by swapping `1` with `5` or `3` with `1`.
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Actual Output: `4` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance after one swap for all tested cases, including edge cases. It considers the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and calculates the correct distances to the ends of the array.

Since I could not find a case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
