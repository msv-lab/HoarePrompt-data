The code assigns `max_pos` the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the first occurrence of the value `n` in the list `a`. The initial state provides that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. The value of `max_pos` will depend on whether `n` is present in the list `a`.

If `n` is found in `a`, `max_pos` will be the index of that occurrence. If `n` is not in `a`, this will raise a ValueError, but we will assume for this state that `n` is indeed in `a` as per the problem statement. 

The variable `min_pos` is not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, while `n` remains as an input integer and `a` remains as a list of distinct integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`.**
