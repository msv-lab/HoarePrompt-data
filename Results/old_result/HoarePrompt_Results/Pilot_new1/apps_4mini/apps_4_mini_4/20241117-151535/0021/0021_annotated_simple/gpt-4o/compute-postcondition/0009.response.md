The code prints the value of `max_distance`, which is determined by the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The specific values of these distances are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `max_distance`. However, we can state that the output reflects the calculated maximum distance based on the given distances. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `max_distance` is derived from the maximum of the distances, without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`max_distance` is derived from the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**
