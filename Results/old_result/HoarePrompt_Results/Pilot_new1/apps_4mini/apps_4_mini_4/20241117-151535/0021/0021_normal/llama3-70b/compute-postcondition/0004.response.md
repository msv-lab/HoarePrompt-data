To analyze the given code snippet, we need to determine the values of `max_dist` based on the initial state:

1. `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`.
2. `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.
3. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
4. The calculation involves finding the maximum of two values: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.

Since `pos1` and `posn` depend on the specific arrangement of the distinct integers in the list `a`, we cannot determine their exact values without that information. However, we can outline the possible outcomes based on the formula.

The output state will reflect the calculation for `max_dist`:

- If `pos1` and `posn` are known, we can compute `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`.
- The value `n - 2` is straightforward since `n` is between 2 and 100.

Thus, the output state will indicate that `max_dist` is determined by the maximum of these two calculated values, but without specific values for `pos1` and `posn`, we cannot provide a specific numeric output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
