`pos1` is assigned the index of the value `1` in the list `a`. The value of `n` determines the length of `a`, which contains a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. Since `1` is guaranteed to be in `a`, `pos1` will hold the index where `1` is located. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`**
