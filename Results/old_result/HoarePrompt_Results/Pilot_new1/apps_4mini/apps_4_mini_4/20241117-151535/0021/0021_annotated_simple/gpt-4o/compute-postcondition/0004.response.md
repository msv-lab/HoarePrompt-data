The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The calculation involves taking the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`, which is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The value of `max_pos` is not specified in the initial state, but it is an integer representing the index of `n` in `a`. Therefore, the value of `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos`. 

The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.**
