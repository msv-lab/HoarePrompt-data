The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to `n`). It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list `a` to either end of the list (index 0 or index n-1) and prints this maximum distance. The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints, such as if `1` or `n` are not present in the list, which could lead to a ValueError when calling `index()`.
