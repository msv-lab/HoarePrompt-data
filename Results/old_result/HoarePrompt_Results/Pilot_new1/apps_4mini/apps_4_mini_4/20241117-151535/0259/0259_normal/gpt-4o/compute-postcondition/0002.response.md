According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop can execute for `n` iterations. Before the loop starts, the variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
