The variable `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is less than `t`, the expression `(t - s_i)` is positive. Since it is provided that `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, `d_i` is not a divisor of `(t - s_i)`, which means `wait_time` will be a positive integer.

The output state reflects the values of the variables after the calculation of `wait_time`. The values of `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, `d_i` is a positive integer, and `wait_time` is a positive integer.**
