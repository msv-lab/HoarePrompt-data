The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `chosen_route`. The state of `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1**
