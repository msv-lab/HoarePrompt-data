Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated from the buses based on the formula (t - s) % d, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that provides this minimum time. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute at least once. If all calculated times are equal to or greater than positive infinity, then `min_time` remains positive infinity, and `ans` remains -1.**
