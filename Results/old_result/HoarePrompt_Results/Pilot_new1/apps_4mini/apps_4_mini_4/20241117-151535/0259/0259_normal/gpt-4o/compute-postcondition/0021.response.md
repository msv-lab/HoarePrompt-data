The code calculates `wait_time` using the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are defined as the first and second elements of `bus_routes[i]`, respectively, and `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`. 

Since `s_i` and `d_i` are not explicitly defined in terms of specific values in the initial state, the output state will reflect the formula used for calculating `wait_time` based on the current values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.

Output State: **`wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
