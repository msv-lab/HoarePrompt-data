The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `-1`, which does not depend on the previous values of any of the other variables. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `min_wait_time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `chosen_route` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1**
