Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This accounts for all scenarios where the calculated `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, thus ensuring that the minimum wait time and corresponding route are chosen appropriately. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`.***
