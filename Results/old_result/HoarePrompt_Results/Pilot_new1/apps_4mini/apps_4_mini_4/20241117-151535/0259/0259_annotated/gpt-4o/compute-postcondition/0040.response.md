The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100). The parameter `t` is a positive integer representing the time (1 <= t <= 100000). The parameter `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(s_i, d_i)` represents a bus route with `s_i` and `d_i` being positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000). After executing the function body, it returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time, which is indicated by 'chosen_route'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time), and bus_routes (a list of bus route tuples), and returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time.**
