The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input and mapping it to integers. The initial state indicates that `s` and `d` are input integers, and since `n` is greater than 100, it does not affect the assignment of `s` and `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` have been assigned values based on user input while maintaining the state of `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)], `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
