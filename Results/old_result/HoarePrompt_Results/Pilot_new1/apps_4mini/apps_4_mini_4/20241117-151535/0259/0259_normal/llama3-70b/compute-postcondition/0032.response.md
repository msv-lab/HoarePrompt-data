Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated as (t - s) % d for the tuples in `buses`, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the tuple that gives the minimum time. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `min_time` remains `float('inf')` and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute for each tuple, updating `min_time` and `ans` based on the calculated `time`.**
