Postcondition: ***`s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. If `t` minus `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating no wait is needed. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always non-negative and reflects the time until the next bus arrives. This covers all cases, including when `s_i` is less than `t`, equal to `t`, or greater than `t`, as well as scenarios where `t` aligns perfectly with bus intervals or falls in between them.***
