According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself but are part of the program state.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
