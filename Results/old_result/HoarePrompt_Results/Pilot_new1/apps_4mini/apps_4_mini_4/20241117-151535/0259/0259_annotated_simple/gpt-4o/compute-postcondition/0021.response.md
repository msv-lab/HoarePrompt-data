To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code and the initial state of the variables.

1. `wait_time` is calculated using the formula: `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
2. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and `s_i` and `d_i` are derived from `bus_routes[n]`.
3. The calculation involves the current values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. However, we do not have specific values for `s_i` and `d_i` since they depend on `bus_routes[n]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, but we cannot specify a numerical result without knowing those values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `wait_time` is calculated based on `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[n]`**
