Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If the calculated `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`. This accounts for all scenarios regarding bus arrival schedules based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`.***
