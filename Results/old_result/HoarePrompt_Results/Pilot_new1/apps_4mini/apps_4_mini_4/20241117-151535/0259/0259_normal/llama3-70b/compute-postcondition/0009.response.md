The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input and splitting it into two integers. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `s` and `d` obtained from the input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)] appended with the new tuple (s, d), where `s` and `d` are input integers.**
