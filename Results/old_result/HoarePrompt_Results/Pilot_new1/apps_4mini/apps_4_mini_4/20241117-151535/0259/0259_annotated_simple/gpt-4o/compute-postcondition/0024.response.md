The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, which has been calculated based on the conditions provided regarding `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. The specific value of `wait_time` is not given in the initial state, but it is defined based on the conditions stated. The values of other variables (`n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `min_wait_time` to the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, and `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`**.
