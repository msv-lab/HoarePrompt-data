The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `wait_time` is 0, `i` is n, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `wait_time` is 0, `i` is n, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]**
