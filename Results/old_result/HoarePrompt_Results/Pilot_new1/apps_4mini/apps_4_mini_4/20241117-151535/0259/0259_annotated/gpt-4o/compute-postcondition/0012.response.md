Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t` (non-negative). If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, if `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference is not divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives.***
