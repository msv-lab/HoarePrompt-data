According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. If `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), and `i` has been incremented by 1, then `i` must be adjusted to be equal to `n - 1` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `n - 1` and `n` remains the same. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` will also need to be updated according to the new value of `i`, but since they are not specifically defined in terms of their relationships to `i` or `n`, we will not modify them.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[n - 1]`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
