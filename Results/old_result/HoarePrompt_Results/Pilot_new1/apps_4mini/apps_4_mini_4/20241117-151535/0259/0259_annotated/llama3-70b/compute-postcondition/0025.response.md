Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, `min_time` remains unchanged and `ans` remains -1.***
