According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it reached in the loop, which is `n - 1`, and `n` is not specified but must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. 

Since `i` is currently at `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least `n`, which means `i` should be incremented to `n`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to `n`, and since `min_wait_time` and `wait_time` are not dependent on the loop iteration, they remain unchanged.

State: **`wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of n, `i` is n**
