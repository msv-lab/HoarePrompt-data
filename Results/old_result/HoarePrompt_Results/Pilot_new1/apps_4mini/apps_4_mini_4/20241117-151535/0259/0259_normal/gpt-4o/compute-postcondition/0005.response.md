The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the value of `wait_time` will be non-negative. The specific value of `wait_time` depends on the current values of `s_i` and `t`, but since we do not have explicit values for them, we can only state the relationship.

The output state reflects that `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i` and `t`, with `s_i` being greater than or equal to `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t` (non-negative).**
