Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `t` is exactly aligned with a bus arrival (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), the `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, the `wait_time` is determined as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the wait until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This covers all scenarios for the bus arrival schedule based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`.***
