The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of bus routes, where each route is represented by a tuple of starting time and interval. It calculates the wait time for each bus route relative to the time `t` and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating no available routes. The function does not handle cases where the input values are negative or invalid.
