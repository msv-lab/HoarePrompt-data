Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (the number of bus routes) and `t` (the current time), and processes `n` bus routes defined by pairs of integers `(s, d)`, where `s` is the starting time and `d` is the interval for each bus. It calculates the minimum time until the next bus arrives based on the formula `(t - s) % d` and returns the 1-based index of the bus with the shortest wait time. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it will print `-1`. **
