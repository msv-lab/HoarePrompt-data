The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` is an empty list. After executing the code, `buses` will contain one tuple consisting of the values of `s` and `d`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, as the operation only affects the `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `s` and `d` are input integers**
