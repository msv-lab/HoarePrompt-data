The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. Since `s_i` and `d_i` are now being updated with the values from `bus_routes[i]`, the previous values of `s_i` and `d_i` are overwritten. The initial state does not provide specific values for `bus_routes[i]`, but it indicates that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which implies that `bus_routes` has sufficient entries to access `bus_routes[i]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`**
