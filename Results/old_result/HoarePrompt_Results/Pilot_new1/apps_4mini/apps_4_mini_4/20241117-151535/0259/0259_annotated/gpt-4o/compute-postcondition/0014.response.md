The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous value of `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and the value of `wait_time` is less than this previous value. Therefore, `min_wait_time` will now hold the value of `wait_time`, which is a positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.**
