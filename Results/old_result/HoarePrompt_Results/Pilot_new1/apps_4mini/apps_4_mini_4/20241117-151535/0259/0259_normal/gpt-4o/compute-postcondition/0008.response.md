The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, the first element `s_i` of the first tuple in `bus_routes` is less than `t`, and the difference (t - s_i) is divisible by d_i, and `wait_time` is 0.
