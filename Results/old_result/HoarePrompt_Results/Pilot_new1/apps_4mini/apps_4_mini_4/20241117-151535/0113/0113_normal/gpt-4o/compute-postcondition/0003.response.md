The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained by the condition that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained by the condition that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as \(n \times \left(\frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{math.gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})}\right)\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a calculated value based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, and returns a calculated value x based on the formula involving n and a multiplier.**
