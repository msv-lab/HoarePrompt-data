Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier based on `k`, and returns the product of `n` and the least common multiple of `n` and the calculated multiplier. The return value depends on the greatest common divisor of `n` and the multiplier, thus it does not simply return `n` multiplied by 10, 5, 2, or 1 as stated in the annotations. **
