Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., the remainder of x divided by i is 0).***
