According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` to indicate that the loop cannot execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted since `gcd` remains unchanged and does not need to be modified for the loop to check the condition.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1**
