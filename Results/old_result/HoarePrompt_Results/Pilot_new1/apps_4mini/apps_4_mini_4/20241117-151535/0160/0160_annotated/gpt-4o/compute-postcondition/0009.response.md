Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, and if `x` is divisible by `i`, then the `divisors` set includes both `i` and `x // i`, in addition to its previous values. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the `divisors` set remains unchanged.***
