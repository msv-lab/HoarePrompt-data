The statement assigns `max_divisor` the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, but we do not know its previous value. The value of `gcd` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change in `max_divisor` based on the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated to `i + 1, max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`**
