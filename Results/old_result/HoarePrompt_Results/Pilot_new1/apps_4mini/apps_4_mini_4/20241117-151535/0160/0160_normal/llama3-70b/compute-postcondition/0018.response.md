Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is initially set to `gcd`, and `i` is 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd` if `gcd` is 1. If `gcd` is greater than 1 and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Thus, `max_divisor` will be equal to `gcd` or a divisor of `gcd` greater than 1, depending on the conditions met.***
