Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. Since `gcd % i == 0`, `max_divisor` remains `gcd`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is also compared with `gcd // i`, which is still `gcd` when `i` is 1, ensuring that `max_divisor` remains unchanged as `gcd` throughout the execution.***
