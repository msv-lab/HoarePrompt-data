The function accepts two integers `N` and `K`, and a list of `N` integers `A`, computes the gcd of the elements in `A`, finds the largest divisor of this gcd that is less than or equal to its square root, and prints this divisor. The parameter `K` is unused, and the function does not handle cases where `N` is less than 1.
