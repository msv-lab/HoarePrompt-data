Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains the value 1 if `x` is 1 and `i` is 1, as `x % i` equals 0, indicating that `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes occur to the `divisors` set.***
