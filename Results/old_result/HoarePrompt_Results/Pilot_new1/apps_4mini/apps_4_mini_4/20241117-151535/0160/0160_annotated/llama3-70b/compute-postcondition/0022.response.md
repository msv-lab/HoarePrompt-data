Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is either `gcd` or `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. This covers the case where `gcd` is a perfect square of `i`, ensuring that `max_divisor` retains its initial value.***
