Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6; `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1; if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i`, capturing all divisor pairs for `x`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `divisors` remains unchanged.***
