According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. The loop will execute if `gcd` is at least 1 because the range starts from 1. The upper limit of the range is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, which means that if `gcd` is less than 1, the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1, as that is the starting point of the range.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
