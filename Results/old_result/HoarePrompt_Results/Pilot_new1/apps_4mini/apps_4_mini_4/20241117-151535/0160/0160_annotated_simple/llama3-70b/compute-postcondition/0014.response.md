The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` (which is greater than or equal to 1) and `i` is 1, we can compare `gcd` and `1`. The value of `max_divisor` will remain `gcd` since it is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the output state is: `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` remains `gcd`.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` remains `gcd`**
