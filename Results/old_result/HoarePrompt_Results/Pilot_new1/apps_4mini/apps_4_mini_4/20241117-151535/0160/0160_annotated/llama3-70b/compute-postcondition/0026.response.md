The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is unknown, but it is affected by the division of `gcd` by `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_divisor` is updated based on this calculation.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the calculation of `gcd // i`**
