Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd` (if `gcd` >= 2) or updated to 2 (if `gcd` < 2), and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`, where `i` is 2. This means if `gcd` is greater than or equal to 2, `max_divisor` could be updated to `gcd // 2` if it is greater than the previous value of `max_divisor`. If `gcd` is less than 2, `max_divisor` remains 2 if it was not updated.***
