The code adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. Given that `x` is equal to `K` and `i` is 2, the expression evaluates to `K // 2`. The previous state of `divisors` includes the integers 1 and `K`, and now it will also include `K // 2`. The values of `N`, `K`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes the integers 1, `K`, and `K // 2`, `i` is 2, and `x` is equal to `K`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes the integers 1, `K`, and `K // 2`, `i` is 2, and `x` is equal to `K**
