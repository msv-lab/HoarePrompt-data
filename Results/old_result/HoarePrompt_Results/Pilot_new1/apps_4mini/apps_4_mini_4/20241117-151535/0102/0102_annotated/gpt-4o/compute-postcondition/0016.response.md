Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, and `n` is an integer such that n is either less than 0 or greater than 9. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, and a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. For values of `n` that are less than or equal to 10 or greater than or equal to 20, the function does not execute any return statement.***
