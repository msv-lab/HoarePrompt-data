The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 and a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. For values of `n` that are less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not execute any return statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its string representation based on specific conditions related to its value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns a string representation of n based on its value: from the ones list if n is between 0 and 9, from the teens list if n is between 11 and 19, from the tens list if n is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, and a combined string for other values between 10 and 99.**
