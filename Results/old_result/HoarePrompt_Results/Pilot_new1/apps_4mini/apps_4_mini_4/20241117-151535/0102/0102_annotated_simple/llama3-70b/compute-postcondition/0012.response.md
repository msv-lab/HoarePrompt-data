Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the output is the corresponding string from `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output is the corresponding string from `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is a combination of the appropriate entry from the `tens` list and the `ones` list, with a hyphen separating them if `s` is not a multiple of 10. The function handles all integers appropriately, including edge cases for exact multiples of 10 and values at the boundaries of the defined ranges.***
