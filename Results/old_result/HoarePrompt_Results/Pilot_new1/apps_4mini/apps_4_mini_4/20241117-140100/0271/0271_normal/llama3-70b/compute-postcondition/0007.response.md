The code calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`. Given that `n % 10` is greater than 5, we know that `10 - n % 10` will yield a positive integer. Therefore, the output will be the original value of `n` plus a positive integer. 

The final value will be `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which is effectively rounding `n` up to the next multiple of 10.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is not divisible by 10, and `n % 10` is greater than 5, we can conclude that the output will be `n` rounded up to the next multiple of 10.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, `n % 10` is greater than 5, and the output is `n` rounded up to the next multiple of 10.**
