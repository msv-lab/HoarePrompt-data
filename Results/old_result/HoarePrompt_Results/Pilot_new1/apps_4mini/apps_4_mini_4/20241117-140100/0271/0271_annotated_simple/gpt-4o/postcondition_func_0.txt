The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the nearest multiple of 10 based on the last digit of `n`, and prints the result. If the last digit (remainder) is 5 or less, it rounds down to the nearest lower multiple of 10; if it is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest higher multiple of 10. The function does not return any value.
