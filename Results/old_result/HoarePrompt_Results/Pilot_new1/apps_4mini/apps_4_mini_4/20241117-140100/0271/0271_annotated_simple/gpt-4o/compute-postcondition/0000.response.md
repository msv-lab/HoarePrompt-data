The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output state will reflect that `n` is an input integer within the specified range. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
