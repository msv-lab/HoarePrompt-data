The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user and prints the nearest multiple of 10. If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
