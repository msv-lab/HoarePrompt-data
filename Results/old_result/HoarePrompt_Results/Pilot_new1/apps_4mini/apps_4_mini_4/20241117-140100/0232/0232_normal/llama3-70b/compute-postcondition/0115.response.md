Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True if a matching color count is found within the first `n-1` colors; otherwise, `found` remains unchanged. `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]`. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, `found` remains unchanged, and `window_counts` is still empty. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged.**
