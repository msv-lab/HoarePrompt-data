Postcondition: ***`color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `found` is True if the counts of colors in `window_counts` match the target counts specified in `counts`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; otherwise, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
