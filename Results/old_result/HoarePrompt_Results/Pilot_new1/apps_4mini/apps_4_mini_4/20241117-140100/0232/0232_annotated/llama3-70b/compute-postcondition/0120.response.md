Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary reflecting the counts of each color encountered in `colors` from index `i` to `n-1` during the loop execution. If `found` is True, it indicates that the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty and `found` being False. If `n` is equal to or less than 0, the outer loop does not execute, leaving `window_counts` empty and `found` as False. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the inner loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, with `found` remaining False.**
