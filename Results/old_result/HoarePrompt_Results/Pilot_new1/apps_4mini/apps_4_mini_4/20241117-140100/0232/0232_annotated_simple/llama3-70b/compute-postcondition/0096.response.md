The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` includes the key `color` with its value updated, `found` is True, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
