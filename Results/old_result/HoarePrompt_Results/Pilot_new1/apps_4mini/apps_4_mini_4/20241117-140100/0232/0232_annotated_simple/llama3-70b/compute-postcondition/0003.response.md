The code initializes an empty dictionary `color_counts`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. The variables `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts` remain as they were. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of these variables along with the newly initialized `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers based on input, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
