Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that includes the key `color`, which is set to 0 if it was not already present. The dictionary `color_counts` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`. If `color` was already a key in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
