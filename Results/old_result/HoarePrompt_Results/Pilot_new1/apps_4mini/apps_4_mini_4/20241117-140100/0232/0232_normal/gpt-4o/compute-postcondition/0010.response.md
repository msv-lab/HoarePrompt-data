Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive). If the counts in `current_counts` for all colors match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it does not return a value.***
