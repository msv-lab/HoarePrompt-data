The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The current value of `j` is 2, so `color` will be set to the value of `colors[2]`. The other variables (`color_counts`, `i`, `n`, and `window_counts[color]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]**
