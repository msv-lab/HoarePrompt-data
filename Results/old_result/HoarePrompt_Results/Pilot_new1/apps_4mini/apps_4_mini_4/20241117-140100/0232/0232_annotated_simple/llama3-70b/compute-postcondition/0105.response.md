Postcondition: ***`window_counts` includes the key `color` updated to its count + 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged, while `i`, `n`, and `j` also remain unchanged.***
