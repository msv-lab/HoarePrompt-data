Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `color`. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The variable `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` remains greater than `i + 1`. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary.***
