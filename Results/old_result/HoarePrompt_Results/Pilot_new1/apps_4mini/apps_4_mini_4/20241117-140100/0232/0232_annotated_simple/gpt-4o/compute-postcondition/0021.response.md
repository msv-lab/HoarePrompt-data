Output State: **`current_counts` contains the counts of each color as they are updated during the loop execution, `left` is incremented only when the counts of the current window meet or exceed the desired counts, and `right` tracks the current index in `colors`. If the initial state of `current_counts` already satisfies `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES' immediately, and `left` remains 0. If no valid window is found by the end of the loop, `left` will reflect the number of increments made, and `current_counts` will represent the final counts of colors processed. If `n` is 0 or `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `current_counts` remains empty, `left` is 0, and the function does not return anything.**
