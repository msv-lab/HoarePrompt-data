The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` includes the key `color`, which is incremented by 1; `found` is True; `i` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
