The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` includes the key `color`, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
