Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned `colors[2]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1. If the counts of `window_counts` sorted values match the `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged and the program continues execution without breaking.***
