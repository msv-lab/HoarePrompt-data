The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
