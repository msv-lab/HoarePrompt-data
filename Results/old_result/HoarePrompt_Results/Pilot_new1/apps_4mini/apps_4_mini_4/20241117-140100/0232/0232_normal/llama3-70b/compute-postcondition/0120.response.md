Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `found` is True, it indicates that a matching color count was found during the loop execution, and `i` and `j` represent the indices at which this match was found. If `found` is False, the loop may not execute if `n` is 0 or less, in which case `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, and `found` is still False. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, if `found` is True, it indicates a successful match; otherwise, the variable states remain as they were before the loop execution.**
