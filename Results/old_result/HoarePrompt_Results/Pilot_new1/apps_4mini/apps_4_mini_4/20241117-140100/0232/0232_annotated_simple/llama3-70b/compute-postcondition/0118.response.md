Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop, indicating that `window_counts` matches the corresponding values in `counts`. If `n` is not greater than `i`, or if `colors` is an empty list, or if `i` is out of bounds, then `window_counts` remains empty, and `found` remains False.***
