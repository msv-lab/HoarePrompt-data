Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first element in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers based on input, and `color_counts` is a dictionary that includes `color` as a key with a value of 0 if `color` was not previously in `color_counts`. If `color` was already present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
