Output State: **If the counts of all colors in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES' and `left` is incremented to a value greater than or equal to the initial `left`. If the counts do not match, the loop will continue until `left` exceeds the number of colors or until the condition fails, leaving `current_counts` potentially not meeting the `desired_counts`. If `current_counts` never meets `desired_counts`, then the function does not return anything and `left` will be equal to the initial `left` plus the number of iterations the loop executed. If the initial state of `current_counts` already satisfies the desired counts, the function will return 'YES' immediately without entering the loop. If the initial state does not satisfy the conditions for the loop to start (i.e., if any count in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding desired count), then the loop will not execute and `left` will remain 0.**
