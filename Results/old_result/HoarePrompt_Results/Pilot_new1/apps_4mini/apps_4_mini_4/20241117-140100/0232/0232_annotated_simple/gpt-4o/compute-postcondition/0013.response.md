Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `k` is a list of `m` integers, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m`, and at least one count in `current_counts` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to its corresponding desired count in `desired_counts`. If all values in `current_counts` for each color in `desired_counts` match their respective desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
