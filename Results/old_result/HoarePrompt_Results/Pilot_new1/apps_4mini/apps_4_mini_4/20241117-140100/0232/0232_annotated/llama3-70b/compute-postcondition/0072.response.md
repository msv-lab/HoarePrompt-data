Postcondition: ***`window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `found` is set to True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` when sorted, the loop is exited, indicating that the desired condition has been met. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as no else part is defined.***
