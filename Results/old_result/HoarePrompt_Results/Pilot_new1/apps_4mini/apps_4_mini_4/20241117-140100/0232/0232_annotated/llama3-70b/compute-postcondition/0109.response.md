Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `color`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already a key in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. The variable `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.***
