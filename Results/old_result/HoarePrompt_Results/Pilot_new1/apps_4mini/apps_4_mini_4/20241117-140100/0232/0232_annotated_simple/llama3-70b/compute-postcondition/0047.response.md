Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If all values in `window_counts`, when sorted, are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain as specified.***
