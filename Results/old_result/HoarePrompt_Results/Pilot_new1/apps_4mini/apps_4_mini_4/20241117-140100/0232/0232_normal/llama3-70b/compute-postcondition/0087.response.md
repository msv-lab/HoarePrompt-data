The variable `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The values of `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment of `window_counts`.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
