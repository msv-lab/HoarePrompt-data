Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of elements is less than or equal to `n`, and all `current_counts` are greater than or equal to `desired_counts`. If all `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If there are any discrepancies between `current_counts` and `desired_counts`, the function does not return anything.***
