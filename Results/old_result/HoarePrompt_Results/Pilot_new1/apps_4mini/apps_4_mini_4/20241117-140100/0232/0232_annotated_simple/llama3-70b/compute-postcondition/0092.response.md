Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that includes the key `color`, which is assigned the value 0 if `color` was not previously present in `window_counts`. The variable `found` remains False, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` where `j` is `i`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
