Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary, and if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 1, while `color_counts` remains unchanged, and the variables `i`, `n`, and `j` maintain their values of 1, greater than 1, and 1 respectively.***
