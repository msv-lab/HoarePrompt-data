The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the key `color` with a value that is greater than or equal to 1, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` such that for each pair of count and target, the count is equal to the target, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
