Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts reflecting the counts of each color encountered in `colors` from index `i` to `n-1`. `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted; otherwise, `found` remains False. The variable `i` is incremented with each iteration until it reaches `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, and `i` is unchanged.**
