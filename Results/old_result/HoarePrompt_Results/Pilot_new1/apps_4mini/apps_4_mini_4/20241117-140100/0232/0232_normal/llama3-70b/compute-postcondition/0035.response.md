Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if the counts of the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and if `color` is not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
