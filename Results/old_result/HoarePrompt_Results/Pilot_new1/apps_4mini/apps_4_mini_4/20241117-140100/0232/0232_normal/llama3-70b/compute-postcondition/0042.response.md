The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `window_counts[color]` was `1`, and now it is changed to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is 0, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is 0, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]**
