Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` will now contain the key `color` with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, this condition will not change its value or state.***
