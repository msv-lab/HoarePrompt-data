The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` and `j` may have any values depending on the loop execution, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` contains the updated count for `color`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
