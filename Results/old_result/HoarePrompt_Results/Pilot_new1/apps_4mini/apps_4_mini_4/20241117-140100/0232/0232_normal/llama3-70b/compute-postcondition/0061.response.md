Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` for all pairs of counts and targets.***
