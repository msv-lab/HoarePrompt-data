Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `color` is the second element in the `colors` list, and `counts` is a list of integers based on input. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
