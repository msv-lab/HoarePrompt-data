The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The previous state of `window_counts` is not specified, but it is being reset to an empty dictionary. The values of the other variables (`found`, `i`, and `n`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `window_counts` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`window_counts` is {}, `found` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1**
