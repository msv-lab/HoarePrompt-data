Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of digits with at least 3 digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and `c` is the third character in `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` will contain the third character `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an empty string.***
