According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`, which is a non-empty string of digits with at least one more character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is still a non-empty string of digits, and since it has at least one more character, we can conclude that the loop will execute one more time for the next character in the string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute again:
1. The string `s` needs to be reduced by one character, as the loop will move to the next character.
2. The character `c` will be updated to the next character in the string `s`.
3. The variable `n` may or may not change depending on the presence of `c` in `t_set`, but since we don't know the specific value of `c` or its relation to `t_set`, we will leave `n` unchanged for this state adjustment.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `s` has one less character and `c` is the next character in the string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least one character, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` remains unchanged**
