The `yield` statement produces a value, allowing the function to return `candidate` without terminating the function's execution. The initial state indicates that `candidate` is a valid number formed from the first permutation of the string `chars`. The values of `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged after the yield. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a valid number.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a valid number**
