To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The problem states that we need to find the smallest possible integer `n` that can be formed by appending the number of digits in `n` (denoted as `k`) to a string representation of `n`, after the digits of `n` have been shuffled. We are given a string `s` (the shuffled digits) and a substring `t` (which is part of `n`).

The program provided is as follows:

```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)
print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Building `n`:** The program creates a new string `n` by iterating through the characters in `s` and appending characters to `n` that are present in `t_set`. This means it collects characters from `s` that are also in `t`, but does not ensure that the count of these characters matches the count in `t`.

2. **Appending `t`:** After collecting characters, the program appends `t` to `n`. However, the program does not account for the need to ensure that the digits in `n` (after appending `t`) are the smallest possible. 

3. **Leading Zeros:** The program does not handle leading zeros correctly in the final output. If `t` has leading zeros, and `n` is constructed in a way that `t` is appended directly, it may lead to an invalid integer representation.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the input:
```
s = "003512"
t = "021"
```
According to the problem description, the smallest integer `n` that can be formed is `30021`. However, the program will construct `n` as follows:
- From `s`, it collects `0`, `0`, and `2` (since `t_set` contains `0`, `2`, and `1`).
- Appending `t` gives `0021`, resulting in `0021` which, when converted to an integer, becomes `21`. However, the correct integer should be `30021`.

Thus, the program does not generate the correct output for this input.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly construct the smallest integer `n` as required by the problem description, particularly in cases involving leading zeros and the correct ordering of digits. 

Correctness: **False**.
