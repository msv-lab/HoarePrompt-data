According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character, as permutations of an empty string would result in no iterations. Since `chars` is specified to be a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it can be empty, but it must have at least one character for the loop to run.

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` will hold the current permutation of `chars`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `chars` must not be an empty string, and `perm` will be the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
