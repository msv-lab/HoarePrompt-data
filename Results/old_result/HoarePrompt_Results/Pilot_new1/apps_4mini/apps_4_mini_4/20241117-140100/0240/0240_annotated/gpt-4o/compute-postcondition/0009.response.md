According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `perm` is currently the second permutation of `chars`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the total number of permutations of `chars`. If `chars` is a non-empty string, it can have multiple permutations, and the second permutation indicates that there are at least two permutations available. 

Since the loop will continue until all permutations have been exhausted, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now moving to the next permutation. As `perm` is currently the second permutation, the next permutation will be the third permutation. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `perm` is now the third permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
