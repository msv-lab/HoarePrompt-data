The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns `True` if `sub` is found within `num_str` and the length of `num_str` matches a variable `n_len`. If either condition is not met, it returns `False`. However, the variable `n_len` is undefined in the provided code, which could lead to a NameError if it is not defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the function may not work as intended without proper context for `n_len`.
