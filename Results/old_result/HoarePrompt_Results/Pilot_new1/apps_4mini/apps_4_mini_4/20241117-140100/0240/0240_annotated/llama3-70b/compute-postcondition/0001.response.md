The variable `n` is assigned an empty string. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged as it is a string of digits, and `t_set` is still a set of unique digits from `t`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `n` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`; `n` is an empty string**
