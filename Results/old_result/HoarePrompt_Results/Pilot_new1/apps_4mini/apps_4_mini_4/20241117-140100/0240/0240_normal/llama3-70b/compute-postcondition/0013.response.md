Output State: **`n` is a string containing the digits from `s` that are also in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `s` contains digits that are not in `t_set`, those digits are ignored and do not affect `n`, which only accumulates digits found in `t_set`.**
