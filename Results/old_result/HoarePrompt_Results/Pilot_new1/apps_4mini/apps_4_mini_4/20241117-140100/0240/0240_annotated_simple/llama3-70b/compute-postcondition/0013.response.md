Output State: **`n` is a string consisting of the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains an empty string. If `t_set` is empty, the loop will execute for each character in `s`, but `n` will remain an empty string since no characters will be found in `t_set`.**
