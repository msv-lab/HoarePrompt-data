To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a string `s` that represents a shuffled version of `n` followed by the number of digits in `n`. The string `t` is a known substring of `n`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    n += t
    return int(n)
```

#### Code Logic
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `t_set` as a set of characters from the substring `t`.
2. **Character Filtering**: It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is found in `t_set`, it appends `c` to the string `n`.
3. **Appending Substring**: After the loop, it appends the substring `t` to the string `n`.
4. **Return Value**: Finally, it converts `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Issues with the Code
1. **Leading Zeros**: The code does not handle the scenario where the constructed number `n` might have leading zeros. For example, if `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the code constructs `n` as `"021"`, which when converted to an integer becomes `21`. However, the expected output should be `30021`. The code fails to ensure that `n` is the smallest possible integer by not considering the arrangement of digits.
2. **Character Order**: The order of characters in `n` is not guaranteed to be the smallest possible arrangement. The program constructs `n` based solely on the presence of characters in `s` that are also in `t`, which may not yield the smallest number.

### Example of Failure
Consider the input:
```
s = "003512"
t = "021"
```
The program would produce `n = "021"` (which is `21` when converted to an integer), but the correct output should be `30021`. This discrepancy shows that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails to correctly construct the smallest possible integer `n` in at least one case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
