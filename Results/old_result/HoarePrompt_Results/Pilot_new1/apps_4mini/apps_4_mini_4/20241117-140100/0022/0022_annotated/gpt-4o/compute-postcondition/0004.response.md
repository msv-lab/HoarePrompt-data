Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 2 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False, indicating that the string is not symmetric at these positions. If the characters match, the function does not return anything, implying that further checks may be required for symmetry, but the current condition holds true.***
