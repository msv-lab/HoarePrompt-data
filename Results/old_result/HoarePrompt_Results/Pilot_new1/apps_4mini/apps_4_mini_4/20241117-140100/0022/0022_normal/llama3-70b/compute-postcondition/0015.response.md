Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string of English letters with a length of at least 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is 2; if the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in `s` are not equal, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, preserving the assumption that `s` could still be a palindrome.***
