Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False if the character at index `i` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`. If the characters match, `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that the string may still be a palindrome, pending further checks.***
