The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`. It correctly handles cases for empty strings and single characters, which are considered palindromes. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where the input string is `None`, which could lead to an error if such input is provided.
