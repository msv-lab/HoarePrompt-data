Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of at least 2 English letters, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at position `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, and the program continues to check further characters for palindrome validation.***
