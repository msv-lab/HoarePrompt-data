The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of at least 2 English letters, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_palindrome` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
