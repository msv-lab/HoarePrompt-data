The code prints a question mark `?`, but it does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variables. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. The value of `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`), and a question mark `?` is printed.**
