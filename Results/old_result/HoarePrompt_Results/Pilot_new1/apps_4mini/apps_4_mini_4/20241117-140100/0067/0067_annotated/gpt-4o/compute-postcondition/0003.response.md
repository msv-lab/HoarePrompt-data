The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `x` is an integer value from input, `y` is an integer value from input, and `z` is an integer value from input. The values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer value from input, `y` is an integer value from input, `z` is an integer value from input, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer value from input, `y` is an integer value from input, `z` is an integer value from input, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`**
