Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nauuo has three groups of voters:
- `x`: number of known upvoters
- `y`: number of known downvoters
- `z`: number of unknown voters

The result can be:
- "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
- "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes.
- "?" if there are multiple possible outcomes due to the unknown voters.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

1. **Condition `x > y + z`**: This checks if the total number of upvotes is greater than the maximum possible downvotes (i.e., all unknowns downvote). If true, it prints '+'.
   
2. **Condition `x < y`**: This checks if the number of upvotes is less than the number of downvotes. If true, it prints '-'.
   
3. **Condition `x == y`**:
   - If `z == 0`, it prints '0' because there are no unknown voters, and upvotes equal downvotes.
   - If `z > 0`, it prints '?' because the presence of unknown voters means the result could vary.

4. **Final Else**: This case handles scenarios where `x` is less than or equal to `y` but not strictly less, which would lead to uncertainty due to unknown votes.

### Edge Cases:
Letâ€™s consider some edge cases:
1. **Case (0, 0, 1)**: The code will print '?', which is correct since the unknown voter could either upvote or downvote.
2. **Case (3, 7, 0)**: The code prints '-', which is correct as there are no unknowns and downvotes are greater.
3. **Case (2, 0, 1)**: The code prints '+', which is correct as upvotes are greater than downvotes.
4. **Case (1, 1, 0)**: The code prints '0', which is correct since upvotes equal downvotes.
5. **Case (1, 1, 1)**: The code will print '?', which is correct because the unknown voter could sway the result.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints affirm the conditions and outcomes stated in the code. They accurately describe the scenarios based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. The output hints are consistent with the logic of the code.

Correctness: **True**.
