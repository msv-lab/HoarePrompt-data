The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output, it is expected to return a value based on the conditions applied to the integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained to be between 0 and 100. However, since there is no specific output or behavior provided, we cannot determine the exact return value or conditions. 

Therefore, without additional information about the output, we cannot accurately describe the functionality of the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is currently undefined based on the provided information.**
