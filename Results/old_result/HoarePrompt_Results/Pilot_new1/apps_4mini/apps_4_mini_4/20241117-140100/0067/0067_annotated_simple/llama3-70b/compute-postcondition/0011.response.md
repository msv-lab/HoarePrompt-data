The code executes a print statement that outputs a question mark ('?'). The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, `z` is not equal to 0, and the output is '?'**
