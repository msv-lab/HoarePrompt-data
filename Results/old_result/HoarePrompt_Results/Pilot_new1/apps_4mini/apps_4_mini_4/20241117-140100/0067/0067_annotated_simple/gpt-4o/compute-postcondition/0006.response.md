The code executes a print statement that outputs a single hyphen ('-'). The values of the variables are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, and a hyphen '-' is printed.**
