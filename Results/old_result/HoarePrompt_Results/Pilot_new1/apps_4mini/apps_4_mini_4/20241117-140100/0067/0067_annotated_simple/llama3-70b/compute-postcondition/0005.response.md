The `print('-')` statement outputs a single hyphen character to the console. This action does not change the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`, which remain as integers with the conditions specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables along with the action taken.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is less than `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; and a hyphen '-' is printed.**
