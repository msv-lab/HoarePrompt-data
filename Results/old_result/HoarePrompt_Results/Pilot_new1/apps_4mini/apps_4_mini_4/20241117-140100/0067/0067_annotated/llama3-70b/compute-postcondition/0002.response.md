The code executes a print statement that outputs a plus sign ('+'). The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, but the output of the print statement occurs. The initial conditions regarding the variables are still valid. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100; `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the function prints '+'.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100; `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the function prints '+'**
