`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from input, and `min_upvotes` is already assigned the value of `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and the newly calculated `max_upvotes`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer value from input, `y` is an integer value from input, `z` is an integer value from input, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`**
