The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `?` to the console. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since the print statement does not modify any variable states. Therefore, the output state will include the conditions of the variables as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is greater than `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; and the output is '?'**
