Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. The value of `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, where `max_downvotes` is less than or equal to `min_upvotes`, and the value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, where `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z` and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.***
