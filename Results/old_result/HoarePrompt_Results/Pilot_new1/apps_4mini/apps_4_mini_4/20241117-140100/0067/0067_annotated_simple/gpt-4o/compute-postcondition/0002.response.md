The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The value of `x` and `z` are both new integers based on input values. Since the specific input values for `x` and `z` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical output for `max_upvotes`. However, we know that `max_upvotes` will be the sum of the input values for `x` and `z`. The variable `min_upvotes` remains unchanged and is equal to `x`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between these variables without specific numerical values. 

Output State: **`x` is a new integer based on input values, `y` is a new integer based on input values, `z` is a new integer based on input values, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z**.
