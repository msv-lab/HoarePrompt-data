The variable `denominator` is updated by performing an integer division with `gcd`. The previous value of `denominator` is not specified, but it is divided by `gcd`. The value of `numerator` is already updated to `numerator // gcd`, and the `gcd` value does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `denominator` based on its previous value.

Output State: **`numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`, and `denominator` is updated to `denominator // gcd`**
