To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the provided function `func_2`.

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two integers `n` and `k`, and calculates the number of days as `2^n` (which is `1 << n`).

2. **Immediate Condition**: It checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If so, it directly returns `1 1`, which is correct since if there are more people than days, at least two must share a birthday.

3. **Calculating the Probability**:
   - The program initializes `numerator` and `denominator` for the probability calculations.
   - It uses a loop to calculate the product for the numerator (the number of ways to choose `k` birthdays without sharing) and the denominator (the total number of ways to assign `k` birthdays).
   - After calculating `p_no_shared` (ways to assign birthdays without sharing) and `p_total` (total possible assignments), it computes `p_shared` (the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday).

4. **Reducing the Fraction**: The program reduces the fraction `A/B` using the greatest common divisor (gcd).

5. **Final Output**: It prints the reduced values of `A` and `B` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Edge Cases

- **Case with Large `n` and Small `k`**: If `n` is very large (e.g., `10^18`), the program may run into performance issues due to the loop iterating `k` times, especially if `k` is also large. However, Python can handle large integers, so this may not be a direct issue.
  
- **Case with `k = 2` and `n = 1`**: The program should correctly return `1 2` since the probability of two people sharing a birthday in two available days is `1/2`.

- **Case with `k = 3` and `n = 1`**: This case should return `1 1` because there are not enough days for 3 people, which is handled correctly.

- **Case with `k = 2` and `n = 2`**: This should return `1 4` since the probability of two people sharing a birthday among 4 days is `1/4`.

- **Case with `k = 5` and `n = 2`**: This should return `1 1` because there are not enough days for 5 people, which should be handled correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that it correctly handles the requirements stated in the problem description for the given examples and potential edge cases. The logic for calculating the probability and reducing the fraction seems sound, and it also handles the edge case of more people than days properly.

Thus, I cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
