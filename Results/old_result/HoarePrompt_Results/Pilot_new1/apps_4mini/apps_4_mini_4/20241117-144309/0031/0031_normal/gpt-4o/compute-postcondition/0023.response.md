The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, which is already defined as the value of `denominator`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
