The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The initial value of `denominator` is 2, and `total_days` is also 2. Therefore, after execution, `denominator` becomes 2 * 2 = 4. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 1**
