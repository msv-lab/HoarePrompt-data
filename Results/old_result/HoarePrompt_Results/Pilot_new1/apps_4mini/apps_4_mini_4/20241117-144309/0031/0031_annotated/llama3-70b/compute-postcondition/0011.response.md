The `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is 4, and `total_days` is 2. Thus, the new value of `denominator` becomes 4 * 2 = 8. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 2**
