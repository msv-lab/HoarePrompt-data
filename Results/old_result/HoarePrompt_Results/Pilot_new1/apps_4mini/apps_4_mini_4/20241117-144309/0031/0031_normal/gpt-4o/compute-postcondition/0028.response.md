The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, with `n` constrained such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `k` constrained such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns; otherwise, the function does nothing. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and print (1, 1) if `k` exceeds 2 raised to the power of `n`, while doing nothing if it does not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, and does nothing otherwise.**
