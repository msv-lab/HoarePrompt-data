The code assigns the value `1` to `denominator`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), `total_days` (which is `2` raised to the power of `n`), and `numerator` (which is `1`). The assignment does not affect these other variables. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is `2` raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `1`, and `denominator` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
