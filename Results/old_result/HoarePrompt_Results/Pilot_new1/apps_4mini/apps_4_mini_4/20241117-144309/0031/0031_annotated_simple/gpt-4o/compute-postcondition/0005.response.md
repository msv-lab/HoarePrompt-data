The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2` raised to the power of `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. The value of `total_days` will therefore be `2 ** n`. 

The initial state does not provide any specific value for `k`, but it states that if `k` is greater than `2 ** n`, the program prints (1, 1) and returns. However, since the code provided does not contain any output or return statements, and only initializes `total_days`, we focus solely on the impact of this line.

Thus, the output state reflects the value of `total_days` based on the value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
