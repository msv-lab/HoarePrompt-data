According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not provided, but we know that it should be incremented in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.

Since the loop is structured as `for i in range(k)`, if the loop has executed `k` times, then `i` would be equal to `k` after the last iteration. To allow for one more execution, `i` needs to be less than `k`, specifically `i` should be `k - 1` at the end of the last iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now `k - 1`.

State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is k - 1**
