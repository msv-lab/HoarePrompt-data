The code `total_days = 1 << n` assigns the value of `total_days` as `2` raised to the power of `n` (since left shifting by `n` is equivalent to multiplying by `2^n`). The value of `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`, which is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. The state of `k` does not change, and it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `k`, and the newly calculated `total_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
