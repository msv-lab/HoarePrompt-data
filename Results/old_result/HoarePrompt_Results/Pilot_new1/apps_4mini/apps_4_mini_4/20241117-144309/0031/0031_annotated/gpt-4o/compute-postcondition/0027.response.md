To provide the output state, I will summarize the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`
- `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`
- `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`
- `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`
- `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`
- `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`
- `A` is divided by `g`
- `B` is assigned the value of `B // g`

The `print` statement outputs the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `numerator`, `denominator`, `MOD`, or the result of `func_1(A, B)`, the output state will reflect that the values of `A` and `B` are modified but cannot be determined without those specifics.

Output State: **`A` is modified by dividing by `g`, `B` is modified by integer division by `g`, and the function prints `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`**
