The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. The initial values are `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is \(2^n\), and `i` is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `numerator` becomes \(1 \times (2^n - 0) = 2^n\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
