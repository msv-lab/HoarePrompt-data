To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate how well the code fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem statement.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to calculate the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday, given that there are `2^n` possible birthdays. The output should be the irreducible fraction `A/B` representing this probability, where the values of `A` and `B` must be coprime and printed modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Code Evaluation
1. **Function 1 (GCD Calculation)**: 
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function.

2. **Function 2 (Probability Calculation)**:
   - The function first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If it is, it prints `(1, 1)` because it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday (there are not enough unique birthdays).
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the number of ways to choose `k` birthdays without sharing, and then computes the probability of having at least one shared birthday.
   - The numerator is computed as the product of available days for each person (which is correct), and the denominator is simply \( (2^n)^k \).
   - Finally, it calculates the probability of shared birthdays and reduces the fraction using the GCD function.

### Potential Edge Cases
- The program correctly handles the case where `k > 2^n` by returning `(1, 1)`.
- For cases where `k <= 2^n`, the logic seems sound as it calculates the number of ways to select unique birthdays.

### Annotations
The annotations indicate that the function handles cases where `n` and `k` are within the specified bounds. They also mention that the function returns `k` if `n` equals `k`, which is consistent with the logic of the problem.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code and the annotations, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all specified cases. There are no identified edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Therefore, the final verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
