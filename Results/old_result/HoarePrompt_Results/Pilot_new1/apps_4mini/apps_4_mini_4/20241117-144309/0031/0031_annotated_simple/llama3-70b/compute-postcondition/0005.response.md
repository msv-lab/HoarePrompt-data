The variable `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is `2 ** n`, and since `denominator` is initially 1, after the operation, `denominator` will be equal to `2 ** n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is `2 ** n`, `numerator` is `2 ** n`, `denominator` is `2 ** n`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 0**
