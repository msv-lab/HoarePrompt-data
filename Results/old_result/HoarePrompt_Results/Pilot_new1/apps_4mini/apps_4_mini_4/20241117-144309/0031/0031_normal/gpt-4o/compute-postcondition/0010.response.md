The code multiplies `denominator` by `total_days` and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_days` is `2` raised to the power of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Since `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, we need to note that `denominator` will be updated accordingly. However, the specific value of `denominator` and `MOD` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact new value of `denominator`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `denominator` has been updated based on the multiplication and modulo operation, but without specific values, the exact result cannot be determined.

Output State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD` where `total_days` is `2 ** n`**
