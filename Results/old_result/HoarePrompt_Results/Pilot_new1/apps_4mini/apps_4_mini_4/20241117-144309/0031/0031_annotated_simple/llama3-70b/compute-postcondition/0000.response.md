The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which is 2 raised to the power of `n`. The specific value of `n` is not provided, but it is within the range of 1 to 10^18. Therefore, `total_days` will be a very large number, specifically `2` raised to the power of `n`. The variable `k` is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**.
