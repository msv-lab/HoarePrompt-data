The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^18. The exact value of `total_days` will depend on the specific value of `n`, but it will be a very large integer since `2 ** n` grows exponentially. The variable `k` remains unaffected in this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`**
