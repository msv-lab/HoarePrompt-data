The provided Python program compares two very long integers given as strings, while handling leading zeros. Let's analyze the program against the problem description and the annotations provided.

### Problem Description:
1. The program must read two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which may contain leading zeros.
2. It should compare these integers and print:
   - "<" if `a < b`
   - ">" if `a > b`
   - "=" if `a == b`
3. The integers can have up to \(10^6\) digits.

### Program Analysis:
- The program uses `input().lstrip('0')` to read the integers and strip leading zeros.
- It then checks if the stripped strings are equal.
- If they are not equal, it uses string comparison to determine which one is greater or if `a` is less than `b`.

### Annotations:
The annotations state that:
- After stripping leading zeros, if `a` and `b` are equal, it prints "=".
- If `a` is less than `b`, it prints "<", otherwise it prints ">".

### Edge Cases:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program correctly handles leading zeros by using `lstrip('0')`.
2. **Equal Numbers with Leading Zeros**: 
   - Example: `00012345` and `12345` should yield "=". The program handles this correctly.
3. **Comparison of Lengths**: The program does not explicitly compare lengths of `a` and `b` after stripping leading zeros, but string comparison in Python inherently does this correctly.
4. **Cases where both numbers are zero**: For inputs like `0` and `0`, the output should be "=". The program handles this correctly as well.

### Potential Issues:
The program seems to handle the core requirements of the problem description correctly. However, let's consider if there are any edge cases or potential pitfalls:
- The program does not handle the case where both inputs are just leading zeros (e.g., `0000` and `0000`). In this case, it will output "=", which is correct.
- The program does not account for empty input strings, but according to the problem description, both inputs should be valid non-negative integers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to compare two very long integers as specified in the problem description. It handles leading zeros, equality, and comparisons properly. 

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
