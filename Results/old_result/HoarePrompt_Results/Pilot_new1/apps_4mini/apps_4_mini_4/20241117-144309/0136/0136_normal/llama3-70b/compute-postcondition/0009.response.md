Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeroes removed, and `b` is an input string with leading zeroes removed. Since the values of `a` and `b` are not equal, if the value of `a` is less than the value of `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, the output is '>', indicating that `a` is greater than `b`.***
