Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings representing numbers without leading zeroes, or '0' if they are empty; the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. There are no cases where `a` is less than `b` due to the precondition that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
