The code prints the string `'='`, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the variables involved.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, or '0' if it was empty; `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes; the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`; `a` is equal to `b`, and the output is '='**
