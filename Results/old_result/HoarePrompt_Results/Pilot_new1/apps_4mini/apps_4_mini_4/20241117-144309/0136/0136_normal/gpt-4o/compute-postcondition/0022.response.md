Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers without leading zeros, with equal lengths, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. In cases where `b` was originally empty, it is now '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is also '0'.***
