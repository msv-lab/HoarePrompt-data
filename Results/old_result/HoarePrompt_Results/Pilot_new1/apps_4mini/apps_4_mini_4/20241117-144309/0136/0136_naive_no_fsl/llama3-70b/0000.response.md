Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where both inputs are "0" correctly. If both inputs are "0", after stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` will become empty strings. In Python, comparing empty strings results in `False` for both `a < b` and `a > b`, which will lead to incorrect output since the correct output should be "=".

For example:
Input:
```
0
0
```
Expected Output:
```
=
```
Actual Output from the program:
```
< (or >, depending on the implementation of string comparison)
```

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases, specifically when both numbers are "0".
