Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, or '0' if it was empty; `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, then if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All comparisons are valid due to the precondition that ensures `a` and `b` are properly formatted strings.***
