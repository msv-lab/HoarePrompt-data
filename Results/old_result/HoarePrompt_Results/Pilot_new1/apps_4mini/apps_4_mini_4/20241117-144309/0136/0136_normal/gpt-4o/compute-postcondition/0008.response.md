Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representation of a number without leading zeros, and if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. If `b` was originally empty, it is now '0'; otherwise, `b` retains its original value from `data[1]`, which is also a string representation of a number without leading zeros. In case `a` is empty, it is set to '0', ensuring that both `a` and `b` have valid numeric string representations.***
