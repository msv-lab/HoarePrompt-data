The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes. The maximum length of each string is no more than 10^6 characters. After executing the function body, it performs operations based on these string representations of numbers. The function returns a result that is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, but the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return a result based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns a result based on the input values.**
