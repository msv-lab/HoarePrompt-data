The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`. Initially, `a` was an empty string, so after the assignment, `a` now holds the string `'0'`. The variable `b` remains unaffected as it is not involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is `'0'`, `b` is `data[1]` without leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is `data[1]` without leading zeroes**
