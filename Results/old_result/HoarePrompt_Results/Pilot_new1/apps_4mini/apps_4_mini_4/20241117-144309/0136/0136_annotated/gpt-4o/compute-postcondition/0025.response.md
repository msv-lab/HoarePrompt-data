Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros or set to '0' if empty, and `b` is the string from `data[1]` without leading zeros or set to '0' if empty. If the length of `a` is less than that of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than that of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is determined by comparing `a` and `b`: it outputs '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. All comparisons respect the conditions of `a` and `b`, ensuring that empty strings are treated as '0' for accurate comparisons.***
