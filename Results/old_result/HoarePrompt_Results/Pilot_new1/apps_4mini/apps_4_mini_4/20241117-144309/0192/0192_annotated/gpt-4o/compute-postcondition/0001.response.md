To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet. The code calculates the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which computes the number of pairs that can be formed from the difference between `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state where `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the conditions `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we can denote the difference `d = x - y`. 

The expression can be simplified as follows:
- `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of complete pairs formed from the difference.
- `(x - y) % 2` accounts for any remaining single unit if the difference is odd.

Since `x` and `y` are integers and `y` is less than `x`, `d` will always be a positive integer. The result of the expression will thus be an integer value representing the computed result.

We do not have specific values for `x` and `y`, but we know their relationship. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculations based on the difference `d`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the result of the expression is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.**
