The values of `x` and `y` are assigned through the input function, which takes a space-separated string and converts it into two integers. The constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning that `y` must be at least 3 and less than `x`, which in turn must be at most 100,000. Since the initial state does not specify exact values for `x` and `y`, they will be determined by the input provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now defined by the input values, while still adhering to the constraints.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers defined by input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
