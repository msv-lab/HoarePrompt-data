Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` through user input, where the constraints are that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It calculates and prints the result of the expression `((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)`, which effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. However, since the function does not return any value, it only outputs the result to the console. **
