The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that `y` is always less than `x`, the absolute difference is simply `x - y`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by input, but they satisfy the condition 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output will be a positive integer representing the difference.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers defined by input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is abs(x - y) which equals x - y.**
