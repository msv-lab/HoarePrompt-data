The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is not specified in the initial state, but it is at least 0 since it is a part of the calculation. The other variables, `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `sequence[i]`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is `k - 2**
