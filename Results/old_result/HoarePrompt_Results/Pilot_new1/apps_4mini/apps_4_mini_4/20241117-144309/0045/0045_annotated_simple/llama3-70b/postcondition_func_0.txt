The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is zero, it will return the non-zero value, as the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself. If both are zero, the behavior is not defined in the function, which could lead to unexpected results.
