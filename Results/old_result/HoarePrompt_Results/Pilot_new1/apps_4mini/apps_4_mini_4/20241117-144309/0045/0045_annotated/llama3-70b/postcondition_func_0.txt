The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0 at the start, it immediately returns `a`. The function handles cases where `b` is not positive and correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is negative, the behavior is not defined in the annotations, but the function will still compute a GCD based on the absolute values of `a` and `b`.
