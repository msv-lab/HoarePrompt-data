To analyze the code snippet provided, we need to determine the value of `sequence` based on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`.
   - `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The list comprehension `sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]` generates a list of values.
   - The variable `d` is already defined and is the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`.
   - The range for the loop is from `0` to `k - 1`, meaning it will iterate `k` times.

3. **Calculation**:
   - For each `i` in the range from `0` to `k - 1`, the expression `(d * (i + 1))` will evaluate to `d`, `2d`, `3d`, ..., up to `kd`.
   - Thus, the resulting list `sequence` will contain the first `k` multiples of `d`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The variable `sequence` is now defined as a list of length `k`, containing the values `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`.
   - The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of the first `k` multiples of `d`.**
