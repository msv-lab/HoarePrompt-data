According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 3`.

Since the loop starts at `k - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to `k - 3` for the next iteration. The state of `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` do not need to be modified for this adjustment, as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
