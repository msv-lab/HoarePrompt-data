According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than or equal to 1, as the range of the loop is from `k - 1` down to `0`. The loop will not execute if `k` is 0 or negative. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated based on `k`, and `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `k - 1`, which is the starting point of the loop. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is at least 1 and `i` is initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of the first `k` multiples of `d`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 1`**
