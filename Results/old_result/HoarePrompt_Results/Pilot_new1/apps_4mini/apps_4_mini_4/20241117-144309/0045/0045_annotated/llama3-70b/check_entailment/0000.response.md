To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the requirements and the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
1. We are given a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `k`.
2. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that:
   - Their sum equals `n`.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of this sequence is maximal.
3. If no such sequence can be formed, the output should be `-1`.

### Annotations of the Code:
The provided code defines a function that calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, there is no implementation of the logic that constructs the strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and maximizes the GCD.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Strictly Increasing Sequence**: The sequence must be strictly increasing, meaning each number must be greater than the previous one.
2. **Sum Equals `n`**: The sum of the `k` numbers must equal `n`.
3. **Maximal GCD**: The GCD of the sequence must be maximized.

### Edge Cases:
- If `k` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n`, as the smallest possible sum of `k` positive integers (1, 2, ..., k) is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, which is greater than `n` for sufficiently large `k`.
- If `k` is 1, the only valid sequence is `[n]`, and the GCD is `n`.
- If `n` is less than `k * (k + 1) / 2`, the program should return `-1`.

### Missing Logic in the Code:
The provided function only computes the GCD of two integers but does not implement any logic to generate the required sequence of `k` integers. Thus, it fails to address the main problem of creating the sequence that meets the conditions outlined in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not implement the logic necessary to create the strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and maximize the GCD, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the creation of the required sequence, which is essential for solving the problem as stated. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.
