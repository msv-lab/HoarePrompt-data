The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `min_sum` based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
