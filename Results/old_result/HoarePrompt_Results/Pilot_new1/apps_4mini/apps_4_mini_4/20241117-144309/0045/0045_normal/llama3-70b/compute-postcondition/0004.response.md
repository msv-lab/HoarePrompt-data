The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, with `a` taking the value of `b` and `b` taking the value of `a % b`. Since `b` is greater than 0, the operation `a % b` will yield a non-negative result. The previous value of `a` was the initial value of `b`, and `b` will now be the remainder of that initial value of `b` divided by the initial value of `a`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the initial value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the initial value of `b` divided by the initial value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is the initial value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the initial value of `b` divided by the initial value of `a`**
