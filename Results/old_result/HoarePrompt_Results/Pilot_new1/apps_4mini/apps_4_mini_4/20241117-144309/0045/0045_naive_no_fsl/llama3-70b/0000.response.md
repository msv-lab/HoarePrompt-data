To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If such a sequence cannot be formed, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program checks if `n < k`, which is a necessary condition since we need at least `k` distinct positive integers to form a sequence. If true, it outputs `-1`.
- It then attempts to construct a sequence by appending the first `k` positive integers (1, 2, ..., k) to `seq` and subtracting their sum from `n`.
- After constructing the sequence, it checks if the length of `seq` is equal to `k`. If not, it outputs `-1`.
- If the sequence is valid, it prints the sequence.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Maximal GCD Requirement**: The program does not ensure that the GCD of the sequence is maximal. It simply returns the first `k` integers, which may not yield the largest GCD.
   - For example, if `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program will return `1, 2, 3` which has a GCD of 1. However, a better sequence could be `2, 4, 6` which sums to 12 and has a GCD of 2.
   
2. **Handling of Remaining `n`**: After creating the initial sequence, the program does not adjust the last element or the sequence to utilize the remaining `n` effectively, which could lead to missing valid sequences.

### Test Cases to Illustrate Failure:
- For `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the expected output could be `2 4 6` (GCD = 2), but the program outputs `1 2 3` (GCD = 1).
- For `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program will return `1 2 3` (GCD = 1), while a valid sequence like `2 3 5` (GCD = 1) or `1 2 7` (GCD = 1) exists but does not maximize GCD.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description as it fails to provide a sequence with the maximal GCD and does not correctly handle all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
