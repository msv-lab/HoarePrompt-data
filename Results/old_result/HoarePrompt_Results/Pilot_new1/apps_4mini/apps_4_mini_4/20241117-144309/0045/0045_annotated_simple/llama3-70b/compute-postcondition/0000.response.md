The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment. The values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on their previous values. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers, we can assume `a` is assigned the value of `n` and `b` is assigned the value of `k`.

1. The new value of `a` will be the old value of `b`, which is `k`.
2. The new value of `b` will be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which is `n % k`.

Thus, after executing the code, `a` will be `k` and `b` will be `n % k`. The output state reflects these updated values:

Output State: **`a` is `k`, `b` is `n % k`**
