The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers that represent `n` and `k`, respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, it returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `k`, which is the final value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.**
