According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables do not impact the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
