The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in place in descending order. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The sorted order of `b` will depend on its initial contents, which are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values of `b` after sorting.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `b` is sorted in descending order**
