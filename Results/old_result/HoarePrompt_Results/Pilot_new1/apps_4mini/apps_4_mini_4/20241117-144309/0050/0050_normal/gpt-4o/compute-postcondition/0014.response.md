Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, followed by two lists of integers representing buy and sell prices. It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, computes any remaining funds, and prints the total amount of money that can be obtained by selling the shares at the maximum sell price, adding any remaining funds. This includes handling the case where `r` is less than the minimum buy price, resulting in zero shares being bought and the output being equal to the remaining funds. **
