Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, with `max_sell_price` being greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.**
