The variable `shares` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `b` is sorted in descending order, and `shares` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `b` is sorted in descending order, and `shares` is 0**
