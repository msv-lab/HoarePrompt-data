Postcondition: ***`shares` is greater than or equal to 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, and `s` is a non-empty list with no zero elements. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares * b[2]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the values of `r`, `shares`, and other variables as they were before the execution of this fragment.***
