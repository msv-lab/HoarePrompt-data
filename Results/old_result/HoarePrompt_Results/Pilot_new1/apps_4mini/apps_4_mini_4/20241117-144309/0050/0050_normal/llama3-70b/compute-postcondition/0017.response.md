Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `b` is sorted in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[n]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[n]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` when divided by `s[n]`. If `r` is less than `s[n]`, the loop or if statement is exited, and no updates to `shares` or `r` occur.***
