The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `b` is sorted in descending order, `shares` is updated based on the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, `i` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
