The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned based on the input received, where `input().split()` provides a space-separated string of values that are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown, as they depend on the input given at runtime. Other variables `s` and `b` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n`, `m`, and `r` as integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned integer values from input, `s` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers**
