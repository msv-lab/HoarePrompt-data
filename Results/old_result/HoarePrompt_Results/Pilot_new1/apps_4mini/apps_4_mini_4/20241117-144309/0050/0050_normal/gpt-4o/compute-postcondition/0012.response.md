Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, if `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, and the function prints `total_bourles`, which is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. This covers all edge cases, including when `r` is less than `min_buy_price`, resulting in `max_shares` being zero and `total_bourles` being equal to `remaining_bourles`.***
