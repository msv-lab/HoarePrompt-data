According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, the next permutation will be the second one in the sequence of permutations. 

The state of `chars` does not change, as it is a fixed string of digits. However, `perm` must be updated to the next permutation, and `candidate` should also be updated to reflect this new `perm`.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `perm` must be updated to the second permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` must also be updated to equal this new `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
