According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is still a non-empty string of digits and `c` is the first character of `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character after the current character `c`. Therefore, we need to adjust `s` to be a non-empty string of digits that has at least one more character, and `c` should be updated to the next character in `s`. 

If `c` is the first character of `s`, then for the next iteration, `c` should be the second character of `s`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 2 characters, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string, and `c` is the second character of `s`.**
