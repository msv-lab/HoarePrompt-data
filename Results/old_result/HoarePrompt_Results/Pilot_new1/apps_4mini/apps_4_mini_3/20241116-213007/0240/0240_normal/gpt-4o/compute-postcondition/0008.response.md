Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and if `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` does not satisfy the validity condition, no action is taken.***
