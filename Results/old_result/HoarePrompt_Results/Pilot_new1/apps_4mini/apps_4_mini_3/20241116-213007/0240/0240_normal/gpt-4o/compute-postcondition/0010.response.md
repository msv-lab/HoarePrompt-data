The variable `candidate` is assigned the value `''.join(perm)`, which means that `candidate` will be a string formed by joining the elements of the iterable `perm`. The initial state indicates that `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, which is a non-empty string containing digits. Therefore, `candidate` will be a string that represents this third permutation of the characters in `chars`. The values of `chars` and `sub` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the third permutation of `chars` as a string.**
