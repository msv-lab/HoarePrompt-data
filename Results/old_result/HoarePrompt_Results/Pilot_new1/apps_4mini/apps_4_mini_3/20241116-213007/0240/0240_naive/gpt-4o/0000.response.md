To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and identify potential issues.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We are given a string `s` which is a shuffled version of a number `n` appended with the number of digits in `n`.
2. We also have a substring `sub` which is a part of `n`.
3. Our task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from `s` that contains `sub` as a substring.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and splits it into `s` and `sub`.
2. **Character Counting**: It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in both `s` and `sub`.
3. **Remaining Characters**: It calculates the remaining characters after accounting for those in `sub`.
4. **Permutation Generation**: It generates all possible permutations of the remaining characters and checks if they form a valid number that contains `sub`.
5. **Finding the Smallest Number**: It attempts to find the smallest valid number from the generated permutations.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zero Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where the resulting number might have leading zeros. If `sub` is "0", it could lead to an invalid number like "00321".
2. **Performance Concerns**: The use of permutations on potentially very large strings (up to 1,000,000 characters) could lead to performance issues, as the number of permutations grows factorially with the length of the string.
3. **Incorrect Length Matching**: The function `is_valid_number` checks if the candidate number's length matches `n_len`, but it does not ensure that the total length of `n` (including the appended digit count) matches the original length of `s`.

### Test Case to Illustrate Failure:
Consider the input:
```
00001234
012
```
- The expected output should be `30012` (since `n` should not have leading zeros and must contain `012`).
- The program might generate `00012`, which is invalid as it has leading zeros.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly with leading zeros and the potential for incorrect length matching, the program does not fully comply with the requirements set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
