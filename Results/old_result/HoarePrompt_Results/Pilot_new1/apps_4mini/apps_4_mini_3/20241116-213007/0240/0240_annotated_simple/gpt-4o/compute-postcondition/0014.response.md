Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. The function yields `candidate` if it is a valid number with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If all permutations of `chars` are invalid numbers based on the `is_valid_number` function, no candidates are yielded, and the state remains unchanged.**
