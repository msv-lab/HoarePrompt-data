Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the third permutation of `chars` as a string. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, nothing is yielded, but all variables retain their original values.***
