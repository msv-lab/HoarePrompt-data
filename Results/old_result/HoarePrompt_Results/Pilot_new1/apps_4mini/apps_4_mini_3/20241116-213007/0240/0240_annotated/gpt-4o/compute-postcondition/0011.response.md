The code `yield candidate` is used to produce a value from a generator function without terminating it. The variable `candidate` is formed by joining the third permutation of `chars`, but its value is not specified in the initial state. The `yield` statement does not change the state of the other variables but produces the value of `candidate` for iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables and indicates that `candidate` is yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
