Output State: **`n` is a string composed of characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `s` contains digits but none are in `t_set`, `n` stays empty. If `s` contains digits that match those in `t_set`, `n` accumulates those digits as a string.**
