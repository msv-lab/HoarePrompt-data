According to the code, the loop executes over all permutations of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. 

Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, we need to ensure that it moves to the second permutation. The `permutations` function will generate all possible permutations of `chars`, and since `perm` is currently set to the first one, it will need to be adjusted accordingly. 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `perm` should be updated to the next permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string created by joining `perm`.**
