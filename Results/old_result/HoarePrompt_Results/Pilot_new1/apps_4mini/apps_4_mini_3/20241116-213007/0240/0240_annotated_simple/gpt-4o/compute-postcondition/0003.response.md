The `yield` statement produces a value from a generator function and temporarily suspends its execution, allowing the function to be resumed later. In this case, `candidate` is yielded, which means it is returned to the caller but does not change the state of the variables. The values of `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged as a result of the yield.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
