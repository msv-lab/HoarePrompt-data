According to the code, the loop will execute for each permutation of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `perm` as the third permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `perm` is updated to the next permutation in the sequence generated by `permutations(chars)`.

Since `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, it will have a total of `n!` permutations, where `n` is the length of `chars`. If `perm` is currently the third permutation, the next permutation will be the fourth permutation. 

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `perm` to the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` will also need to be updated to reflect this new permutation. The validity of `candidate` according to the `is_valid_number` function is not specified for the fourth permutation, so we can leave that state unchanged since it may or may not be valid.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
