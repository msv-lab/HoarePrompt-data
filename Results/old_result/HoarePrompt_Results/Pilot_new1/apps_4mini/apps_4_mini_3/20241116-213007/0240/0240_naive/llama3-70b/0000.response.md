To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya has a string that is a shuffled version of a large integer `n` with an appended integer `k` (which is the number of digits in `n`). Vasya remembers a non-empty substring `t` of `n`. The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from the shuffled string `s` and the substring `t`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:
```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)
print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two inputs, `s` (the shuffled string) and `t` (the remembered substring).
2. **Set Creation**: It creates a set `t_set` from `t` to facilitate quick membership testing.
3. **Building `n`**: It initializes an empty string `n` and iterates through each character `c` in `s`. If `c` is found in `t_set`, it appends `c` to `n`.
4. **Appending `t`**: After iterating through `s`, it appends `t` to `n`.
5. **Return Value**: Finally, it converts `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The code does not handle the case of leading zeros properly. For example, if `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the code will create `n` as `"30021"` which is valid. However, if `s = "000012"` and `t = "021"`, it will produce `n = "30021"` which is also valid but does not account for the smallest possible integer that can be formed. 
2. **Incorrect Construction of `n`**: The program does not ensure that `n` is the smallest possible integer. It simply collects characters from `s` that are in `t`, which might not yield the correct order to form the smallest integer.

### Example Case That Fails:
Consider the input:
```
s = "000012"
t = "021"
```
The program would construct:
- From `s`, it would collect `0`, `0`, `0`, and `2` (from `t_set`) resulting in `n = "000" + "021"` which evaluates to `21` when converted to an integer, but it should have considered the leading zeros properly and formed `n` as `2100` which is smaller than `30021`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the requirements of the problem description, particularly in ensuring the smallest possible integer `n` is formed. Therefore, it does not meet the problem specifications for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
