According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` variable. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the characters in `chars`, and for the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character. 

Since `sub` is a non-empty substring of `n`, and `n` is formed by the digits in `chars`, it implies that `chars` must also be non-empty. The loop will begin with the first permutation of `chars`, which can be considered as the first arrangement of the characters.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `chars` has at least one character, and we can set the initial state of `perm` to the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of n, `perm` is the first permutation of chars**
