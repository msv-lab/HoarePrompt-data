Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, no value is yielded, and the state remains unchanged.***
