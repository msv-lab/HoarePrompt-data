The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within that range. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
