Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is not a multiple of 10. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the output is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n` (i.e., `n - n % 10`). If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the output is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` (i.e., `n + (10 - n % 10)`).***
