Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `remainder` (which is `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`, which can be `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`, depending on the specific value of `remainder`.***
