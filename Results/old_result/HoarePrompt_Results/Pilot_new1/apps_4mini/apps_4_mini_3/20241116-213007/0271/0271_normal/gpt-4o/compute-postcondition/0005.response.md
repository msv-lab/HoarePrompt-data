The value of `result` is assigned the expression `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is defined as `n % 10` and is greater than 5, we know that `remainder` can be 6, 7, 8, or 9. Therefore, `10 - remainder` will yield values of 4, 3, 2, or 1 respectively. 

The result will be calculated as follows:
- If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + 4`
- If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + 3`
- If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + 2`
- If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + 1`

Since all other variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects the possible values for `result` based on the value of `n` and the possible values for `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, and `remainder` is greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`**
