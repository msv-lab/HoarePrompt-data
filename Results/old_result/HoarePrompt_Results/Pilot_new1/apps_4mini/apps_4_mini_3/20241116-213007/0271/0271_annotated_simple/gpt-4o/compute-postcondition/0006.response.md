Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `remainder` (which is `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n - remainder`, effectively rounding down `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`, effectively rounding up `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. This ensures that `result` is always a multiple of 10 within the bounds of `n`.***
