The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is greater than 5, we can denote the remainder as `remainder = n % 10`. 

Given that the remainder is greater than 5, the possible values for `remainder` are 6, 7, 8, or 9. Therefore, we can calculate `10 - remainder` for each of these values:

- If `remainder` is 6, then `10 - remainder` is 4.
- If `remainder` is 7, then `10 - remainder` is 3.
- If `remainder` is 8, then `10 - remainder` is 2.
- If `remainder` is 9, then `10 - remainder` is 1.

Thus, `result` can be expressed as:

- If `remainder` is 6, `result = n + 4`.
- If `remainder` is 7, `result = n + 3`.
- If `remainder` is 8, `result = n + 2`.
- If `remainder` is 9, `result = n + 1`.

Since `n` is not specified, we can only state the relationship. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`**.
