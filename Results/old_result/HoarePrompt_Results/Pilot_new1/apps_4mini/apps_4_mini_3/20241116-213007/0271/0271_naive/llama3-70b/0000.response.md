Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly rounds the given non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with a zero. 

- If `n` is already a multiple of 10 (`n % 10 == 0`), it returns `n` as is.
- If `n` ends with a digit from 0 to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 (`n - n % 10`).
- If `n` ends with a digit from 6 to 9, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10 (`n + (10 - n % 10)`).

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including:
- The case where `n` is 0, which is already rounded.
- The case where `n` is at its maximum value of 10^9, which is also a multiple of 10.

Thus, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description.
