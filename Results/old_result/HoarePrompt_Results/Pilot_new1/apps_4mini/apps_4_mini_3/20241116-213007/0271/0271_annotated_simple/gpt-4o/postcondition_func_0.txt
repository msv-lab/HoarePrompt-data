The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user and rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` (the remainder when divided by 10) is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10. The function does not return any value but prints the result. It does not handle negative inputs or non-integer values, which could lead to runtime errors.
