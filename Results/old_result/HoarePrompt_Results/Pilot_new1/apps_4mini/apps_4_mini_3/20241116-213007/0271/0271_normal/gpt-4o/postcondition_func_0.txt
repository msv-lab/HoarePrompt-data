The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` from the user and rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` (i.e., `n % 10`) is 5 or less, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10. The rounded result is then printed.
