The code prints a question mark `?`, which does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
