The `print('-')` statement outputs a string consisting of a single hyphen. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, alongside the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is less than `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; and the output is '-'**
