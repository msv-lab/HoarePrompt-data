Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, '0' is printed; otherwise, '?'. In all cases, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).***
