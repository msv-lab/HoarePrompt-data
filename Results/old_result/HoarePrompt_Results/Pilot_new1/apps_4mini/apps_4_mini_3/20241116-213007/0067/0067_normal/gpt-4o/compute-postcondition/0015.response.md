Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through user input, representing minimum upvotes, minimum downvotes, and a range for possible additional votes, respectively. It calculates the maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs. The function then prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. This function does not return any value; it only prints the output based on the comparisons. **
