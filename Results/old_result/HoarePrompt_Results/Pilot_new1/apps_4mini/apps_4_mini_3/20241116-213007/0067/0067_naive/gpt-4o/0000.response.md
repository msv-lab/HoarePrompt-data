Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the number of unknown votes (`z`) could lead to a situation where the results are uncertain. 

For example, consider the input:

```
1 1 1
```

In this case:
- There is 1 upvote and 1 downvote, with 1 unknown vote.
- If the unknown vote is an upvote, the result is `+`.
- If the unknown vote is a downvote, the result is `-`.

Thus, there are two possible results, which means the output should be `?`. However, the program would incorrectly output `?` due to the conditions it checks, failing to recognize the uncertainty that arises from the unknown vote.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly handle this scenario (and potentially others), it is incorrect.
