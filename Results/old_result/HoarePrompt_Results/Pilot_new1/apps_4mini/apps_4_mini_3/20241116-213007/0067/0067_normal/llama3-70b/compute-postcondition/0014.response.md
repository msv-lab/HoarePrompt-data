The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `?`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the output is `?`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the output is `?`**
