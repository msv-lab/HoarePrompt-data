Functionality: ** The function reads three integers from input, `x`, `y`, and `z`, and prints a character based on the comparisons between these integers. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y + z` and not less than `y`, it also prints '?'. The function has no return value.**
