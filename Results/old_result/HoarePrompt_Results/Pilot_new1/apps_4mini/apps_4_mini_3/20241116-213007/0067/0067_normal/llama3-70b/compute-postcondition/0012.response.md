Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `z` is equal to 0, the function prints '0', since `x` is equal to `y` and satisfies the conditions of being greater than or equal to `y` and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. If `z` is not equal to 0, the function prints '?', regardless of the values of `x` and `y`, as the only condition being checked is whether `z` is zero.***
