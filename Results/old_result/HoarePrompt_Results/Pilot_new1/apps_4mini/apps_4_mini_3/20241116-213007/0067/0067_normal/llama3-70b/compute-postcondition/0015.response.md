Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, with `x` greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is equal to 0, the function prints '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not equal to 0, or if `x` is not equal to `y`, the function prints '?'.***
