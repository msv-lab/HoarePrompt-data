The code prints the character `+`, but it does not change the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. The output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged while the print statement executes. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input, and the program prints `+`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input, and the program prints `+`**
