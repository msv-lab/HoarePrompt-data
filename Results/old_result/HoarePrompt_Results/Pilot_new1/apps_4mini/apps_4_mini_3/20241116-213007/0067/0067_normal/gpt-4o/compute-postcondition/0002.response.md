The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x` and `z` are both integers within the range of 0 to 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will also be an integer within the range of 0 to 200, depending on the specific values of `x` and `z`. The other variables `min_upvotes` and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer within 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `y` is an integer within 0 to 100; `z` is an integer within 0 to 100; `max_upvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200**
