Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the characters match, no changes are made to `is_spalindrome`, and the program continues checking the next characters in the string.***
