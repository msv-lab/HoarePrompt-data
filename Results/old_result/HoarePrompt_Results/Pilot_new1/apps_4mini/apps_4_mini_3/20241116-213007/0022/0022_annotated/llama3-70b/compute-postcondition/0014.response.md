The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `is_spalindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
