Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, indicating that the characters are equal, but this case is not explicitly handled in the provided code.***
