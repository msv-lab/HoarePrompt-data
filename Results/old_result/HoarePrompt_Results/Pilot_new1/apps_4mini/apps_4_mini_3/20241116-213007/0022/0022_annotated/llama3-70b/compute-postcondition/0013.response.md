The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
