Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 3, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the value of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, indicating that the string may still be a palindrome.***
