The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. This directly changes the state of `is_palindrome` from `True` to `False`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is False, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is False, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`.**
