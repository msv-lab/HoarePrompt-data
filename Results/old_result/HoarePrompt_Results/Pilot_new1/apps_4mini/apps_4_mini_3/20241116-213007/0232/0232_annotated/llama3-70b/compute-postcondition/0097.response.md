Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1 or greater, and if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the values do not match, `found` remains False, `i` is n - 1, `j` is n - 1, and `n` is greater than 0.***
