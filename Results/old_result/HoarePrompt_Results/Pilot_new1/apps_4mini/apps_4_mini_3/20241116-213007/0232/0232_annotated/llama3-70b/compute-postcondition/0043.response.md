Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `j` is `i + 1`, and if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
