The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1 or greater; `found` is True; `i` is n - 1; `j` is n - 1; `n` is greater than 0; and all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
