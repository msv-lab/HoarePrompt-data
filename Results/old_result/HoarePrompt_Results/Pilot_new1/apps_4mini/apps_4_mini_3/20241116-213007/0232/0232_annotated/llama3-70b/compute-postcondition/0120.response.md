Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to but not including `n` for each iteration of `i`. If `found` is True, it indicates that the sorted values of `window_counts` matched the values in `counts`, and the loop is exited. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `window_counts` remains empty, `found` remains False, and the loop does not execute. If `n` is 1, `window_counts` contains the count of the single color at index 0. If `n` is greater than 0 and the loop executes, the state of `found` will determine whether the loop is exited or continues. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains empty, `found` remains False, and `i` is undefined.**
