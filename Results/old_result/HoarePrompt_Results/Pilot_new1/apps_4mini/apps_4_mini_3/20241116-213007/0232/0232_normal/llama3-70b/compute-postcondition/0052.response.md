Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited and `window_counts` remains unchanged. If `colors` is empty or if `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty, `found` being False, and `color_counts`, `i`, and `n` remaining unchanged.***
