Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
