Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the key `color` with its corresponding value; if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `n - 1`, with `color` assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and no changes are made to the other variables.***
