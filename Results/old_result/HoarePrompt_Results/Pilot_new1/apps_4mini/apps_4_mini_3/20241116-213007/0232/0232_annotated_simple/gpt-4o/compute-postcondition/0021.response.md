Output State: **`right` will be the number of iterations the loop has executed, `current_counts` will reflect the counts of colors from the `colors` list up to the `right` index, `left` will be incremented if the while condition is met, and it may reach `n` if no valid segment is found. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]` for any color at the start), `left` and `right` will remain 0, and the function will not return anything. If the loop executes and finds a valid segment where all `current_counts[color]` equal `desired_counts[color]`, the function will return 'YES' immediately. If no such segment is found by the end of the loop, the function will not return anything.**
