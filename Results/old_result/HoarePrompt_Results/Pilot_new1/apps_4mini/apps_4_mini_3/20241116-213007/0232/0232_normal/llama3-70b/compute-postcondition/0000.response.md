The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input provided, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. Other variables `colors` and `counts` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `m` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n**
