Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary, if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, while `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` already exists in `window_counts`, no changes are made to `window_counts`, and all other variables retain their previous values.***
