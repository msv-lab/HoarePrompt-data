The value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. Since `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`, it has been added with an initial value of `0`, and now it becomes `1`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `i` and `j` both equal to `n - 1` and `n` being greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1, `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1, `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `n` is greater than 0**
