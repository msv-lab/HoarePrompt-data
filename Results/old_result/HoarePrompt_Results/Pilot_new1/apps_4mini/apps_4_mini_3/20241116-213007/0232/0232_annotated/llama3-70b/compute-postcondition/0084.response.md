The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the counts of each unique `color`, `found` is True, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
