Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `found` is set to False, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; otherwise, `window_counts` remains unchanged. `color` is assigned from `colors[0]`.***
