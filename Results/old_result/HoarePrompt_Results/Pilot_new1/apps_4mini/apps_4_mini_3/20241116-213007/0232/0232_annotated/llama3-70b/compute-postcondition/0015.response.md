Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` < length of colors, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and if `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
