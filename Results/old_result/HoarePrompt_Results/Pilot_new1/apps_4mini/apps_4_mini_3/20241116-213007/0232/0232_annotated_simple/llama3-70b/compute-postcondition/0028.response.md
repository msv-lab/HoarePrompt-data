Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `found` is False; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `color` is the first element of `colors`; `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1; the counts of the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when both are sorted.***
