Output State: **`window_counts` contains the count of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `n-1` to `n-1`, and may increment for each subsequent index until `n`. If the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True. If `n` is equal to `n-1`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `n-1`. If there are no colors in the range from `n-1` to `n`, the loop will not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being empty and `found` remaining False.**
