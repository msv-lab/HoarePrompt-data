Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` (which is `n-1`) to `n`, `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, otherwise it remains False. If `n` is equal to or less than `n-1`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `n-1` (if `n` is greater than `n-1`) or undefined (if `n` is not greater than `n-1`).**
