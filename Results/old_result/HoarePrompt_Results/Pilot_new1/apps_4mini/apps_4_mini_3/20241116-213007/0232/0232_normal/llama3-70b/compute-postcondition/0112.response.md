The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains the key `color`, which is either 1 or incremented by 1; `found` is True; `color_counts` remains unchanged; `i` is `n`; `n` is greater than `n-1`; `j` is `n`; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
