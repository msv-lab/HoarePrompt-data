Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `color` is the second element in the colors list, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not previously in `color_counts`, it is now added with a value of 0.***
