Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is updated with `color` having a value of 1, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
