Output State: **If `current_counts` matches `desired_counts` from the start, the loop returns 'YES' immediately. If `current_counts` does not match `desired_counts`, the loop executes with `right` ranging from 0 to n-1, incrementing `current_counts[colors[right]]` accordingly. If the loop condition is never satisfied (i.e., `current_counts` cannot match `desired_counts`), `left` remains 0 and the loop does not execute. After the loop, `current_counts` contains the counts of colors seen so far, `right` is n-1, and `left` may be incremented based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If `right` equals n, it indicates the end of the loop execution.**
