The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, where `n` is constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and `k` is constrained to the range 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of the expression (numerator % (10). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` and return the result of a modulo operation involving a numerator and 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, and returns the result of (numerator % 10).**
