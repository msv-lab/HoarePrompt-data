Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the function does not execute any specific return statement, and the program continues execution without any output.***
