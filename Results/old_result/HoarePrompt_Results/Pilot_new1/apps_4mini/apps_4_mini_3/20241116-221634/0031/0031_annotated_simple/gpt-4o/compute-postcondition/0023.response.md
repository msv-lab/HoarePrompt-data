The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The previous value of `p_total` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\). The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\), `total_days` is \(2^n\), `k` is at least 2, `p_no_shared` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `p_total` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\), `p_shared` is calculated as \( (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) \mod MOD\), `A` is assigned the value of \( p_shared\), and `B` is assigned the value of \( p_total\).

Output State: **`numerator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\), `total_days` is \(2^n\), `k` is at least 2, `p_no_shared` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `p_total` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\), `p_shared` is calculated as \( (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) \mod MOD\), `A` is assigned the value of \( p_shared\), `B` is assigned the value of \( p_total\)**.
