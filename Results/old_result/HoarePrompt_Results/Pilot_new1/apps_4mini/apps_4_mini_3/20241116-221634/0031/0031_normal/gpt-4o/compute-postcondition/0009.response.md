To determine the output state, we will analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18
- `total_days` is 2^n
- `numerator` is 1
- `denominator` is 1
- `i` is 0

The code snippet is:
```
numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD
```

1. We calculate `total_days` as `2^n`.
2. The current value of `i` is 0.
3. Therefore, `total_days - i` simplifies to `total_days - 0`, which is `total_days`.
4. The `numerator` is currently 1.
5. The new value of `numerator` will be calculated as `1 * total_days % MOD`.

Since `MOD` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact final value of `numerator`. However, we can express the state based on the calculations we performed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n; `numerator` is (1 * total_days % MOD); `denominator` is 1; `i` is 0**
