The code updates the value of `denominator` by multiplying it with `total_days`. The initial value of `total_days` is `2^n`, and the initial value of `denominator` is also `2^n`. Therefore, after executing the line `denominator *= total_days`, the new value of `denominator` becomes `2^n * 2^n`, which simplifies to `2^(2n)`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1), `denominator` is 2^(2n), `i` is 1**
