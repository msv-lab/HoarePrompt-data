Output State: **`numerator` is equal to the product of (2^n - i) for i in range(k), `denominator` is equal to 2^(k * n), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n. If `k` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1 and `denominator` remains 1.**
