The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which calculates 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), `total_days` will be a large integer value. The variable `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\)**
