Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, it prints (1, 1) and terminates without returning a value. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the numerator and denominator based on the values of `k` and `total_days`, computes a shared probability, reduces it by their greatest common divisor, and prints the reduced values modulo `10^6 + 3`. The function does not return anything in either case. **
