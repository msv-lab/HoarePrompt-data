According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2, and `i` should be incremented to 3.

State: **`total_days` is `2^n`, `i` is 3, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^n - 2) % MOD, and `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD, k` is greater than 2**
