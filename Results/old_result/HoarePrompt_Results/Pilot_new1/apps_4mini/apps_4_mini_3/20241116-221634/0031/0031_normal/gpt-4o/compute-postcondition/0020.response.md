The value of `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The previous value of `denominator` is not specified, but it is calculated as `total_days` raised to the power of `k` modulo `MOD`. The values of `numerator` and `p_no_shared` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is the product of `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, and `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, and `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**.
