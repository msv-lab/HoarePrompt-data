In the given initial state, the value of `p_no_shared` depends on the value of `k`. However, the code snippet provided assigns `p_total` the value of `denominator`. The values of `p_no_shared` and `denominator` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Since we do not have specific values for `denominator`, the output state will reflect that `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, while the state of `p_no_shared` remains unchanged based on the initial condition regarding `k`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned based on `k`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**
