The variable `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The value of `denominator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003 \), which remains unchanged in this operation. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `numerator`, `denominator`, `total_days`, `k`, and `p_no_shared`, along with the new assignment for `p_total`.

Output State: **`numerator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\), `total_days` is \(2^n\), `k` is at least 2, `p_no_shared` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `p_total` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\)**
