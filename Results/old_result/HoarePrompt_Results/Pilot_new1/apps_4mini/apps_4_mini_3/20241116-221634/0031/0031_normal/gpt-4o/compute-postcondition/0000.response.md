The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 6 + 3`, which evaluates to `1000003`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `MOD` while retaining the previous values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003**
