To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet provided on the initial state. 

1. The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
2. The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
3. The variable `g` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(A, B)`.
4. The operation `A //= g` performs integer division on `A` by `g`, updating the value of `A`.

Since `A` is modified by integer division with `g`, its new value will depend on the specific values of `A` and `g`. However, the exact numerical values of `A` and `g` are not provided in the initial state.

Therefore, we can conclude:
- The value of `A` is changed to `A // g`.
- The values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, and `B` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned based on `k`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, `g` is assigned the result of func_1(A, B), and `A` is updated to A // g.**
