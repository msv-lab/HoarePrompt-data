The variable `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_days` is \(2^n\). Therefore, after the execution of the code:

1. `denominator` is updated from its previous value of 1.
2. The new value of `denominator` becomes \(1 \times (2^n \mod 1000003) \mod 1000003\), which simplifies to \(2^n \mod 1000003\).

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \(2^n \mod 1000003\), `i` is 0**
