Output State: **`numerator` is the product of \(2^n\) and the descending integers from \(2^n - 1\) to \(2^n - k + 1\), `denominator` is \(2^{nk}\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\). If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1 and `denominator` remains 1.**
