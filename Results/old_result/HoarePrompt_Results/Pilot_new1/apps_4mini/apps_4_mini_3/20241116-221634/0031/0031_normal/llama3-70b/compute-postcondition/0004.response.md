The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. The value of `total_days` is \(2^n\), and `i` is 0. Therefore, `numerator` becomes \(1 \times (2^n - 0) = 2^n\). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
