The `print('<')` statement outputs the string '<' to the console. The values of the variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of `a` and `b`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros; printed output is '<'**
