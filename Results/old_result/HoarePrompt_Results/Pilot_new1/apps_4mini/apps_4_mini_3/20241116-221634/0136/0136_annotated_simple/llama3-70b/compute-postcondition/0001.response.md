The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which takes an input string and removes any leading zeroes from it. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Since `b` is now modified to be the input string without leading zeroes, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `a` and the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes; `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes**
