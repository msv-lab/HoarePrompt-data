Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeroes. The strings `a` and `b` are not equal; if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output printed is '<'. Otherwise, the output printed is '>', indicating that `a` is greater than `b`.***
