Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers as strings, removes leading zeros from both, and compares their values. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either input is empty, it is treated as '0'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. **
