Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'. `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed; if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, and `b` is a non-empty string.***
