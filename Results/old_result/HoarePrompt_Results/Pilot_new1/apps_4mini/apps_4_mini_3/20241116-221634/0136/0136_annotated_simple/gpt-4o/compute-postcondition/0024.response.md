Postcondition: ***`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, which can be '0' if it was originally an empty string; `b` retains its original value without leading zeroes or is set to '0' if it was an empty string; the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If the lengths are equal, the program compares `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. All comparisons account for cases where either `a` or `b` could be '0' or empty strings, ensuring proper handling of leading zeroes and equality.***
