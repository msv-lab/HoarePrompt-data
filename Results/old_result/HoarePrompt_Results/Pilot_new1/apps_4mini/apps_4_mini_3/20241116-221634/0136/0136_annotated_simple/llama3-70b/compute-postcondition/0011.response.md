The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have a length of up to 10^6 characters. The function processes these strings and returns a result based on their values. However, the specific output or behavior of the function is not defined in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two string parameters representing non-negative integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both strings representing non-negative integers that may contain leading zeroes, with a maximum length of 10^6 characters each.**
