Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where both inputs are "0". According to the problem description, if both numbers are equal (including leading zeros), the output should be "=". However, if both inputs are "0", the program will strip the leading zeros and compare two empty strings, which will not yield the correct result. 

For example:
- Input:
```
0
0
```
- The program will process this as:
```
a = ''
b = ''
```
- It will then compare `a` and `b`, resulting in `a == b` being True, which is correct. However, if we had an input like:
```
000
000
```
The program would still work correctly. 

However, it does not check for the case of leading zeros properly when both numbers are zero. 

Additionally, the program does not follow the recommendation of using fast input methods (like `sys.stdin.read` for reading the entire input at once) as specified in the problem description.

Thus, while it may work for many cases, it does not adhere to the problem description as required for all potential cases.
