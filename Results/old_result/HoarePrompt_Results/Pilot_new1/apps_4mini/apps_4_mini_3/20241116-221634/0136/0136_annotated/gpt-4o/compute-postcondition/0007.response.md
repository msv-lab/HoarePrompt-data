The value of `b` is assigned the string `'0'`. The initial state shows that `b` was an empty string, but after execution, `b` now holds the value `'0'`. The variables `a` and `data` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0'; `b` is '0'; `data` is a list containing two strings, where `data[1]` is `b` which is '0' and does not have leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0'; `b` is '0'; `data` is a list containing two strings, where `data[1]` is `b` which is '0' and does not have leading zeros.**
