The value of `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that `b` will take the input string with any leading zeroes removed. The variable `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeroes**
