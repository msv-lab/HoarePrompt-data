Postcondition: ***`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, which can be '0' if it was originally an empty string. `b` retains its original value without leading zeroes or is set to '0' if it was an empty string. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All comparisons account for the cases where either `a` or `b` could be '0' or empty strings, ensuring proper handling of leading zeroes and equality.***
