The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous value of `a` was an empty string, but it is now updated to `'0'`. The variables `b` and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is `data[1]` without leading zeros, and `data` is a list containing two strings.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is `data[1]` without leading zeros, `data` is a list containing two strings**
