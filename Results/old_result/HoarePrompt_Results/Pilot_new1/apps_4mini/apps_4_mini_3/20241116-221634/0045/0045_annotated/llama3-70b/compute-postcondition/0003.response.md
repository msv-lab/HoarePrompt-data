According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is non-zero (or truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is a positive integer less than its original value (which was `a`). This means `b` is currently greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute one more time without any adjustments needed.

State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is `a % b` which is a positive integer less than `b`**
