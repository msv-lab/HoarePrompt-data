According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, which is at least 0 since `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be equal to `k - 2`. The other states do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly affected by the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`**
