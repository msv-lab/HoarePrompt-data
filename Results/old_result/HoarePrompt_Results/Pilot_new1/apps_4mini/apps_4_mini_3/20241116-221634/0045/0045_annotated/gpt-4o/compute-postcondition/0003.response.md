Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, indicating that it proceeds without an error.***
