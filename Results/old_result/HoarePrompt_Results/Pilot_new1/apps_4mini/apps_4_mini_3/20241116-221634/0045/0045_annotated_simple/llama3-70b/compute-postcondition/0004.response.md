The code snippet assigns new values to `a` and `b`. Specifically, `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since the initial state states that `b` is the value of `a % b`, we can denote the previous values as `a_old` for `a` and `b_old` for `b`. After the assignment, `a` takes the value of `b_old`, and `b` takes the value of `a_old % b_old`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` based on the calculations made.

Output State: **`a` is `b` (previous value of `b`), `b` is `a % b` (where `a` is the previous value of `a` and `b` is the previous value of `b`, which is positive and not equal to 0)**
