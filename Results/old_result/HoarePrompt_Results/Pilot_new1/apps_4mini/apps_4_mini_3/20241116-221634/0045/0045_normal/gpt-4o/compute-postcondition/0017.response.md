The code decrements `remainder` by 1, while the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `sequence[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `remainder` while keeping the other variables as they are.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1**
