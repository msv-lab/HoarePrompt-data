The value of `min_sum` is assigned the result of the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, and while the specific value of `k` is unknown, the formula calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The state of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2**
