The variable `remainder` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `n - d * min_sum`. The values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` are used in this calculation, but since their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `remainder`. However, we can express the relationship based on the initial state.

The output state will reflect that `remainder` is calculated based on the current values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.**
