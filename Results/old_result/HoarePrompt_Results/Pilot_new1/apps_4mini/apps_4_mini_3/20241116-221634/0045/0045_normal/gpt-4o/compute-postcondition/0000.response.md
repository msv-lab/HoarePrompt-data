The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This expression calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. The variables `n` and `k` are positive integers, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `min_sum`, but we can express it in terms of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2**
