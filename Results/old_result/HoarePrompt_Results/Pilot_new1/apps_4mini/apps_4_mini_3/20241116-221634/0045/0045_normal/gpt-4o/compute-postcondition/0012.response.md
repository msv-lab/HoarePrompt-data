The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the state of `sequence[i]` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `sequence[i]`, along with the updated value of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1**.
