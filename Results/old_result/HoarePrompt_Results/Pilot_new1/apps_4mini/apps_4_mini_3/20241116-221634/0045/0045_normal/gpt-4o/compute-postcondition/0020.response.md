Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1 if `remainder` is equal to 0, resulting in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remainder` is not equal to 0, the program continues without any changes to `sequence[i]` or `remainder`.***
