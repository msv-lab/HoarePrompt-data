Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the execution continues without breaking.***
