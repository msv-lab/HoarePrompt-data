According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1`, since when `k` is `0`, the range becomes `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which does not yield any values and thus the loop does not execute.

Given the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer, which does not impact the loop execution directly.
- `k` is a positive integer, which must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.
- `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` are calculated based on `k` and `n`, but their values do not affect the ability of the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `k` must be at least `1`, and `i` should start at `k - 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 1`**
