According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is `a % b`, which is a positive integer less than the original value of `b`. Since `b` is positive, it can execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is `a % b`**
