The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if the minimum sum (`min_sum`), calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, indicating that it proceeds without an error.

In Case 2, the function returns the unchanged sequence since the loop did not execute due to the remainder being initially 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return -1 if the minimum sum exceeds `n`. If the minimum sum is within the limit, it proceeds without returning a value. Additionally, if the loop does not execute, it returns the unchanged sequence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, returns -1 if the minimum sum calculated from `k` exceeds `n`. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, it proceeds without returning a value. Additionally, it returns the unchanged sequence if the loop does not execute.**
