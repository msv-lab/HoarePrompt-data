According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`, which is currently `k - 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, which means the loop has not executed for `i = k - 2` yet.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so it will be `k - 2` at the start of the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, ensuring that `i` will still be valid (i.e., `i` will be non-negative).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is the value from the previous iteration (which has been increased by 1).**
