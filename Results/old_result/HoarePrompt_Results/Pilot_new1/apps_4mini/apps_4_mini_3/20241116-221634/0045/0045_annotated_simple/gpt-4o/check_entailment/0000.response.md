To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD). If such a sequence does not exist, we should return -1.

### Code Analysis
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers. This is the minimum sum required to form a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers.
   - If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program correctly returns `-1`, as it's impossible to form such a sequence.

2. **Divisor Calculation**:
   - The program computes `d` as `n // min_sum`, which represents how many times we can scale the minimum sequence to try to reach `n`.

3. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `remainder` as `n - d * min_sum`, which indicates how much more we need to add to reach `n`.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs a sequence of the first `k` integers multiplied by `d`.
   - It then attempts to distribute the `remainder` across the sequence by incrementing the last elements until the `remainder` is exhausted or until the sequence remains strictly increasing.

### Potential Issues
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is larger than `n`. For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program would return `-1`, which is correct. However, if `n` is just slightly larger than `k`, say `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the program will return `[1, 1, 1]`, which is not strictly increasing. This is a violation of the problem constraints.

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
n = 3
k = 3
```
- The minimum sum required is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is greater than `3`. The program would return `-1`, which is correct.
  
However, consider:
```
n = 5
k = 3
```
- The minimum sum required is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is again greater than `5`. The program correctly returns `-1`.

But if we test:
```
n = 4
k = 3
```
- The minimum sum required is `6`, which is greater than `4`, so the program correctly returns `-1`.

However, if we test:
```
n = 7
k = 3
```
- The minimum sum required is `6`, so `d` would be `1`, and `remainder` would be `1`. The sequence would initially be `[1, 2, 3]`, and it would increment the last element to get `[1, 2, 4]`, which is valid.

### Conclusion
The program seems to work correctly for the provided examples and additional edge cases. However, the potential case of returning a non-increasing sequence when `k` is greater than `n` or when the distribution of the `remainder` does not maintain strict increase is a concern.

Thus, the program can fail to maintain strictly increasing sequences under certain conditions.

Correctness: **False**
