The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is 0 at the start, the function will immediately return `a` without any calculations. The function does not enforce any constraints on the input values, meaning it can handle negative integers and zero, but the GCD is typically defined for non-negative integers. Therefore, the implementation may not behave as expected for negative values or zero.
