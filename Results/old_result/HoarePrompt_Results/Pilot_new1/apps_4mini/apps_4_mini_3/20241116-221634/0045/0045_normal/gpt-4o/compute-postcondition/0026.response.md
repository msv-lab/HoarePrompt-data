The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). 

In Case 1, if the minimum sum (`min_sum`), calculated as \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\), is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, indicating that `min_sum` is valid in relation to `n`.

In Case 2, the function returns the current state of `sequence`, which reflects the incremented values if `remainder` was greater than 0. If `remainder` is 0 or `k` is 0, the `sequence` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, return -1 if the minimum sum is greater than `n`, and return the state of `sequence` based on the value of `remainder`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns -1 if the minimum sum is greater than `n`, otherwise returns the current state of `sequence` based on the value of `remainder`.**
