The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the result based on the values of `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is an input integer greater than `y`, we can define `d = x - y`, where `d` is a positive integer. The expression simplifies to `d // 2 + d % 2`, which effectively computes the number of pairs formed by the difference `d`.

The output state will reflect the values of `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression. Since `x` is greater than `y`, we can conclude that `d` will be at least 1.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than `y`, `y` is an input integer such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, and the result is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`**
