Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. However, it does not return any value. The function assumes that the input values satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but it does not handle cases where the input does not meet these constraints. **
