The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any specific output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integers, `x` and `y`, within the specified range, but the specific return value or behavior of the function is not described in the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not specify a return value.**
