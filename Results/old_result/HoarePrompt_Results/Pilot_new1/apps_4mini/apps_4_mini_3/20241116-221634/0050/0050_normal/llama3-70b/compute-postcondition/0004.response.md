The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in place in descending order. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged, but the order of the elements in the list `b` is modified. The output state reflects the new order of `b` after sorting. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
