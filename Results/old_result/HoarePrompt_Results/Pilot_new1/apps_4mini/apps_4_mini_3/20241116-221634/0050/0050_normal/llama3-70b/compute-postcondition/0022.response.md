Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This ensures that `shares` is calculated only when `r` can cover the value of `s[i]`, while also handling the case where `r` is insufficient to proceed further.***
