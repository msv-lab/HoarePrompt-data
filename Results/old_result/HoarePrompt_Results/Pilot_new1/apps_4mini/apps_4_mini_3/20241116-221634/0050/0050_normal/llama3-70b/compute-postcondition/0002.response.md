The variable `b` is assigned a new value, which is a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input.**
