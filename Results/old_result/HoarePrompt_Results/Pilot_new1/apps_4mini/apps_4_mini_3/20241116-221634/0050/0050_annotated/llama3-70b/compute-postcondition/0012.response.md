Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list, `b` is a sorted list in reverse order, `shares` is increased by `r // s[0]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop breaks, and the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
