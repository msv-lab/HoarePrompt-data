Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, and the function prints `total_bourles`.**
