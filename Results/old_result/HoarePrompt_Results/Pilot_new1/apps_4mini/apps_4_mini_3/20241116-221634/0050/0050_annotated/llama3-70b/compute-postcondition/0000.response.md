The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which is then split and converted to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not known but are stated to be integers within specified ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now defined as integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
