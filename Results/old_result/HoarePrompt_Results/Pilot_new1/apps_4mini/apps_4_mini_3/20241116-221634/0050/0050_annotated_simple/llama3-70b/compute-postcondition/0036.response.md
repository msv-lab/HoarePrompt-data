Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]` if `shares` is greater than 0, resulting in `shares` being set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining all other conditions: `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.***
