Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 greater than `i + 1`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list, `b` is a sorted list in reverse order, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. Otherwise, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This ensures that `shares` is adjusted based on the value of `r` in relation to the sorted list `s`.***
