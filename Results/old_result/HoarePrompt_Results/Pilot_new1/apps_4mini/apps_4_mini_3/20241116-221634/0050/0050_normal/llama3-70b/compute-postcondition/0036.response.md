Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of shares bought, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is 0 or negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
