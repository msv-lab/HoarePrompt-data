The variable `s` is assigned a list created by mapping the `int` function over the values obtained from the input, which are separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with the new list `s` that contains the integers parsed from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input**
