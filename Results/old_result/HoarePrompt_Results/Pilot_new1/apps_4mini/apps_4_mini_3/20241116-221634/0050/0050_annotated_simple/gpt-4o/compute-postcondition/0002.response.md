The variable `b` is assigned a new list created from the input provided, where the input is split into separate strings and each string is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation, and `b` will hold the list of integers based on the new input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s`, along with the new variable `b` which will contain the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from new input**
