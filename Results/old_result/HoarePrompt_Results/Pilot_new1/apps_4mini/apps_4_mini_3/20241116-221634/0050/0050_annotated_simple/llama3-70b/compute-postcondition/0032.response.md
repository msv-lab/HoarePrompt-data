According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. The other states do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
