The variable `b` is undefined, which means that attempting to perform the calculation for `b_block` will result in an error or undefined behavior. Therefore, no values can be assigned or calculated for `b_block`, and the output state will reflect that `b` is undefined.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b` is undefined and cannot be used to calculate `b_block`.**
