To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Given:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\).
- `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\).

The code snippet:
```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

In this context, `apartment` is assumed to be either `a` or `b`. The calculation involves determining which block the apartment number falls into based on the total number of apartments per block, which is \(m \cdot k\).

1. The value of `apartment` can be `a` or `b`, both of which are within the range defined by \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\).
2. The expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k)` calculates how many full blocks of apartments fit into the total number of apartments up to `apartment - 1`.
3. Adding `1` to this result gives the block number for the specified `apartment`.

Since we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, we will represent the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` where `apartment` is either `a` or `b`.**
