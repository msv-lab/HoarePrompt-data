The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates with the following constraints: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\); `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\). 

The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details about the return value based on the input constraints, we cannot define the specific functionality regarding the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and a and b are distinct integers within the range of 1 to n·m·k. The output behavior is not specified.**
