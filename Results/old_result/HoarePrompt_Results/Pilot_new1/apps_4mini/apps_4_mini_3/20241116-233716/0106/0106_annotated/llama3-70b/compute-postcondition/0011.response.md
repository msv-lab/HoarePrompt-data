Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an input integer. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. In either case, the minimum floor time is always at least 10, reflecting the base time added to the floor difference multiplied by 5.***
