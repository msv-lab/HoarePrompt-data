The function accepts input values for n, m, k (all positive integers), and two distinct integers a and b. It calculates the minimum time required to travel between two floors and blocks, based on their respective positions. The final output is the sum of the time taken to travel between blocks and the time taken to travel between floors, printed as a single integer. The function does not handle any edge cases for invalid inputs or constraints beyond the assumption that inputs will always be within the specified ranges.
