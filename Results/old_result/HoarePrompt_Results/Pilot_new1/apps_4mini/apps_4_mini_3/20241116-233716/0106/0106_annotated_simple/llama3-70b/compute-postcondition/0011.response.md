Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1, and `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, if `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In all cases, `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 and `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.***
