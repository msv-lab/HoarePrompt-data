To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State: `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5

The code snippet:
```
total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
```

In this code, `total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The values of `time_to_exit` and `min_walk_time` are not provided in the initial state, but `time_to_target_floor` is already defined based on the formula given.

Since `time_to_target_floor` is dependent on `floor_b`, the exact value cannot be determined without knowing `floor_b`. However, we can express `total_time` in terms of the variables involved.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationship among these variables:

Output State: **`time_to_exit` is unknown, `min_walk_time` is unknown, `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5; `total_time` is calculated as time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor**
