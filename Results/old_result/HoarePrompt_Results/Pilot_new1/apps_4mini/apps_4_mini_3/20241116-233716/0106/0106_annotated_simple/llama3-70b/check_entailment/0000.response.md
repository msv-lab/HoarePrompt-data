To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its implementation against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of blocks (entrances).
   - `m`: Number of floors in each block.
   - `k`: Number of apartments on each floor.
   - `a`: Apartment number of Edward.
   - `b`: Apartment number of Natasha.

2. **Apartment Numbering**:
   - Apartments are numbered from 1 to `n * m * k`.
   - The first apartment in each block starts at `1`, and the last apartment in the last block is `n * m * k`.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - Time to move between floors: 5 seconds per floor.
   - Time to move between blocks: 15 seconds per block.
   - Time for the elevator: 10 seconds to arrive + 1 second per floor.

4. **Movement**:
   - Edward can move either clockwise or counterclockwise around the building.

### Code Analysis
The provided code calculates:
- The floor and block of both Edward and Natasha using:
  ```python
  a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
  a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
  b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
  b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
  ```
- The time to move between blocks:
  ```python
  min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
  ```
- The time to move between floors:
  ```python
  if (a_floor > b_floor):
      min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
  else:
      min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
  ```

### Potential Issues
1. **Elevator Use**: The elevator time is not correctly integrated into the overall time calculation. The time to go down to the first floor using the elevator is calculated but not added to the total time when Edward is above the first floor.
2. **Edge Cases with Floors**: If Edward is on the first floor, the elevator time is not applicable, but the logic does not handle this cleanly. The elevator time should only be added if Edward is not already on the first floor.

### Example Case
Consider the case where:
- `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
- `a = 1`, `b = 2`

In this case, the program will incorrectly calculate the time because it assumes the elevator is always used, but since there is only one apartment, the logic fails to account for the fact that Edward is already at the first floor.

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle the elevator logic correctly in all cases, particularly when it comes to the first floor. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
