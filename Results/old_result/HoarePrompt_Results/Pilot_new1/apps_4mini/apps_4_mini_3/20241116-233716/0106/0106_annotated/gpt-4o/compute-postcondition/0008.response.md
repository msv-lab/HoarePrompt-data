The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The calculation involves the previous values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`. 

Since `block_b` is not defined, the value of `abs(block_a - block_b)` cannot be determined, leading to uncertainty in the calculation of `reverse_walk_time`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the calculation cannot be completed due to the undefined variable.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number; `block_a` is defined; `block_b` is not defined; `reverse_walk_time` cannot be calculated due to the undefined value of `block_b`.**
