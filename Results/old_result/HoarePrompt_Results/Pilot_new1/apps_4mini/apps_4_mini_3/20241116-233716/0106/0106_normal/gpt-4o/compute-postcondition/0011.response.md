To determine the output state after running the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the variables involved in the calculation of `total_time`.

1. **Variables**:
   - `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
   - `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
   - `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
   - `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.
   - `total_time` is calculated as `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`.

2. **Calculations**:
   - The values of `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor`, and `total_time` depend on the previous values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `n`, `floor_b`, and `time_to_exit`.
   - The calculation of `total_time` aggregates these values but does not change their individual states.

Since the specific values of `block_a`, `block_b`, `n`, `floor_b`, and `time_to_exit` are not provided, we cannot compute exact numerical results. However, we can summarize the relationships and calculations.

Output State: **`total_time` is calculated as `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`, where `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
