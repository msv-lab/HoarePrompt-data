The function accepts five parameters: integers `n`, `m`, and `k` representing dimensions, and integers `a` and `b` representing locations. It calculates the total time required to exit from location `a` to location `b`, considering the time to exit the current floor, the time to walk between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The calculation includes handling scenarios where the exit floor is either the first floor or higher, and it computes the minimum walking time based on the direct and reverse paths between blocks. The function returns the total calculated time.
