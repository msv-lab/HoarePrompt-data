Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is `prefix_balances[1]`, and `count` is an integer. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This includes cases where `x` is equal to `b`, `x` is less than `b`, or `x` is greater than `b` but does not satisfy the conditions.***
