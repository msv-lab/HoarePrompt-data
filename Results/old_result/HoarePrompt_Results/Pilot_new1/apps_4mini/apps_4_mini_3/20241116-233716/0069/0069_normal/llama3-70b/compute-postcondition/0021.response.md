The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` to the console. It does not change the state of any variables, so the values of `n`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is assigned the value `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is assigned the value `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1**
