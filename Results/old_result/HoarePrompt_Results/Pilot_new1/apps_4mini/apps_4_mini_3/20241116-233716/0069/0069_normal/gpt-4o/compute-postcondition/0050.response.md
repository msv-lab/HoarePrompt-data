The value of `i` is 1, so we calculate `prefix_balances[1]`. The value of `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, meaning `prefix_balances[0]` is 0. The expression `s[i - 1]` gives us `s[0]`, which is the first character of the string `s`. If `s[0]` is '0', we add 1 to `prefix_balances[0]`, otherwise, we subtract 1 from it. 

Thus, `prefix_balances[1]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[0]` (which is 0) plus either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 1, `balance` is `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `index` is increased by 3, `i` is 1**
