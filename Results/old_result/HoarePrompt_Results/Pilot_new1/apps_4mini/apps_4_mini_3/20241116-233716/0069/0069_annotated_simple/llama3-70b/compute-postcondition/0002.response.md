The values of `n` and `x` are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not specified, but it is known that `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `x` is an integer within the range (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The state of the binary string `s` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9**
