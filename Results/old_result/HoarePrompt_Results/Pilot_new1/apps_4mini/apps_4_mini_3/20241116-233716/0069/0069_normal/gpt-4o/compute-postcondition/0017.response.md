The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. The character at `s[i - 1]` is checked: if it is '0', 1 is added; if it is not '0', -1 is subtracted. The specific value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is not provided, and the character at `s[i - 1]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `prefix_balances[i]`. However, the overall state reflects that `prefix_balances[i]` has been updated based on these conditions.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`.**
