According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times, where `T` is the number of iterations specified. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `_` has taken on a value representing the current iteration, starting from `0` up to `T-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be less than `T`. 

Since the loop iterates from `0` to `T-1`, if `_` is currently equal to `T-1`, it means the loop has completed its iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions must be adjusted to ensure that the loop can continue. 

Thus, if the loop has completed its iterations, we need to set `_` to `T`, which indicates that the loop has finished all iterations and will not run again.
