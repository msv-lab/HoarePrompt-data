The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The previous value of `balance` is `0`, and `prefix_balances` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers. The addition of `0` to `results` does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `prefix_balances` and `balance`, along with the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is 0, and `results` has an additional value of 0 appended.**
