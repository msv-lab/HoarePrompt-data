According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it will allow for `i` to be 2. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be updated to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as `T` and `n` remain unchanged.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[1]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[0]` and the character `s[0]`**
