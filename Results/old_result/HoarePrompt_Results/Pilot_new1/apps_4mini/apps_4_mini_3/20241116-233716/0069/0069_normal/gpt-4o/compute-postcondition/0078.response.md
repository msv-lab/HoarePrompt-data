Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer, and `index` has been increased by 3. If `balance` is 0 and `x` exists in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` does not exist in `prefix_balances`, then `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `count` is appended to `results`. This covers all edge cases, including when `n` is less than 1, in which case `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length `n + 1` and no iterations occur.***
