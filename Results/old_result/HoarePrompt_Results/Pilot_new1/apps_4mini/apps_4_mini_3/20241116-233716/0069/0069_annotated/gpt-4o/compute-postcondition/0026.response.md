Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 based on `s[0]`, and for all `i` from 2 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` reflects the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` such that `balance` is not equal to 0.***
