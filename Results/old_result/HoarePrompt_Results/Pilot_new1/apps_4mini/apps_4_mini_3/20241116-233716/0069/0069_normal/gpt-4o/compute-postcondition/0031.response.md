Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If `(x - b)` is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, `count` remains 0.***
