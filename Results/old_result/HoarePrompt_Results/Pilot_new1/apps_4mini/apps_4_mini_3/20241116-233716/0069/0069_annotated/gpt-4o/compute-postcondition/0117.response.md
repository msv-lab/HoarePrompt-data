Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` indicates the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in the string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1`; if `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of valid indices `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes this `count`. If `T` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list; if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains initialized with all zeros, and the loop does not execute.**
