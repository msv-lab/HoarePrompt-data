The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is an input value converted to an integer. The previous values of the affected variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, `T`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an input integer from `data[index + 1]`, `results` contains -1, and `T` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an input integer from `data[index + 1]`, `results` contains -1, and `T` is greater than 1**
