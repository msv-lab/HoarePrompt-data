Output State: **If `T` is greater than 0, the loop will execute for each element in `results`, printing each result. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains empty. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` will be `[0]`, and `results` will still depend on the prior checks against `x`, which may also lead to an empty `results`.**
