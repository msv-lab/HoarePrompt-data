The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is an input value converted to an integer. The previous state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `balance` is an integer, `_` is T, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, and `x` is an input integer from `data[index + 1]`.
