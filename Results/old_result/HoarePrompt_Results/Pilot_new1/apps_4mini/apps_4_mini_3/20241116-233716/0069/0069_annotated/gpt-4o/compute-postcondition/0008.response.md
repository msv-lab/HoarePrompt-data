The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so `data[index + 2]` refers to `data[3]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly stated, but we know that `data` is a list of strings. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `s` without changing the other variables. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
