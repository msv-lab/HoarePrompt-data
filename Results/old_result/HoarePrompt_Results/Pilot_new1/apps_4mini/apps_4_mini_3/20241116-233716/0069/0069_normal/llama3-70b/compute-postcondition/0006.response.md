Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `iteration` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `x` (where balance is defined as `cnt0 - cnt1`).***
