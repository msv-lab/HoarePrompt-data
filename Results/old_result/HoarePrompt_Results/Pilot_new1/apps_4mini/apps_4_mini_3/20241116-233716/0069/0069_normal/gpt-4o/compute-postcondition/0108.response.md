Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is either 0 or 1. If the expression `(x - b) % balance == 0` holds true and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being either 1 or 2. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
