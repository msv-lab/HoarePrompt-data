The code appends `-1` to the list `results`. The values of the other variables, including `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `results` has been modified to include `-1`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` indicates the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in the string `s`; `balance` is 0; `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`; and `results` has been modified to include -1.**
