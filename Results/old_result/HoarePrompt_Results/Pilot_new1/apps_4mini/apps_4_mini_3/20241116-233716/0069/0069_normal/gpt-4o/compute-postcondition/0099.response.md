Postcondition: ***If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`, and both `prefix_balances` and `balance` remain unchanged. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length 1, `balance` is equal to 0, and 0 is appended to `results`, indicating that `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. In all cases, `x` remains unchanged.***
