The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but it affects the subsequent access to `data`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an input integer from `data[index + 1]`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than 1, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
