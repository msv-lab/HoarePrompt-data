Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` with a non-negative quotient, `prefix_balances` is a list initialized with zeros and has a length of at least `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3; `results` is updated to include `count`.**
