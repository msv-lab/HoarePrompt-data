Output State: **`prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the balance up to the i-th character of `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` from index 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
