The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100.
- `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000.
- `x` is an integer that can range from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these parameters to produce an output based on the provided conditions. However, the specific return values based on the inputs are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (positive integer), n (positive integer), x (integer), and s (binary string) and processes them according to the specified constraints.**
