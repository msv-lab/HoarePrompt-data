According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. The loop will iterate over each element in `results`, and since `results` is a non-empty list, it has at least one element. 

At the end of the last iteration, since the loop has already executed for one element in `results`, for the loop to execute one more time, the state of `results` must change such that it still contains elements. However, since the loop iterates over each element, after one iteration, the next iteration will process the next element in the list.

Since `results` is a non-empty list, the next state should reflect that there is still at least one more element left in the list to iterate over. Therefore, if `results` had `n` elements before the last iteration, it should now have `n-1` elements after the last iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we can adjust the state to indicate that `results` still contains at least one element.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element remaining**
