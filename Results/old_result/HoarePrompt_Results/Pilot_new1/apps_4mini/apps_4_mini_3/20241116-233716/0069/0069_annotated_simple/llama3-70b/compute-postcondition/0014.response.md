Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `balance` (the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`) is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between the count of '0's and '1's (`cnt0 - cnt1`), the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the function handles the potential for division by zero appropriately by avoiding this case in the condition.***
