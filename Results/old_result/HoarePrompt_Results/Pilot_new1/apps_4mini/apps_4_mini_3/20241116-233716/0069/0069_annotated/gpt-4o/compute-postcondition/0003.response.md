The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings, and `index` is 1.

Output State: **`T` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings, and `index` is 1**.
