Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, for at least one index `i` (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n), `prefix_balances[i]` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, and `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance` (meaning `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0)`***
