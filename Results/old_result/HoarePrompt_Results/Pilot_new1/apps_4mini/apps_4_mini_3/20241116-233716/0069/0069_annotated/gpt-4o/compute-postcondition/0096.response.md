The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous state of `results` included `-1`, so after this operation, `results` will contain two `-1` values. The other variables, including `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `x`, `n`, `s`, and `index`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an integer derived from `data[index + 1]`, `results` now includes `-1, -1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` has been increased by 3.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an integer derived from `data[index + 1]`, `results` now includes `-1, -1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` has been increased by 3.**
