The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a binary string and two integers. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in the string and determines how many ways the balance can be adjusted to reach a specified target value. If the balance is zero and the target is found in the prefix sums, it returns -1; if not, it returns 0. If the balance is non-zero, it counts valid adjustments and returns that count. If no test cases are provided, it does not output anything.
