Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is 0. If `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1. Otherwise, if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains an additional element 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `1`, and the results will reflect the presence or absence of `x` in this list accordingly.***
