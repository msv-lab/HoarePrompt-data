Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` for each '0' and `-1` for each '1' up to the i-th position in the string `s`. `n` is at least 1, and `balance` is not equal to 0, indicating that there is an imbalance between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`. The final value of `prefix_balances[n]` reflects this imbalance.***
