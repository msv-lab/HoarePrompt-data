The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The previous values of the affected variables are not stated, but we know that `results` is being modified by adding a new element. The states of other variables such as `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer not present in `prefix_balances`, `s` is a string, `index` has been increased by 3, and `results` has a new element 0 appended.**
