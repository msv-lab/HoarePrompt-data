The code initializes a list `prefix_balances` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, which is the integer value of `data[1]`, and `prefix_balances` is created based on that value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.**
