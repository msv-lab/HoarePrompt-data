The code counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the string `s`. The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the values of these counts. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
