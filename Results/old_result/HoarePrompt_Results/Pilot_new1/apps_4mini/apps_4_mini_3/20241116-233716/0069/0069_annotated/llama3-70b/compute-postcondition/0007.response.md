The code `print(n + 1)` outputs the value of `n + 1`. The variable `n` is a positive integer, so `n + 1` will also be a positive integer. The values of the other variables (`x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `x`, and the function prints `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `x`, and the function prints `n + 1`**
