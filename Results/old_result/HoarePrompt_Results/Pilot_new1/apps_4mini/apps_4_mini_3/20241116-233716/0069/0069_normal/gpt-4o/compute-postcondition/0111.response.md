Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is either 0 or 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being either 1 or 2. If the condition is not met, `count` remains unchanged (0 or 1).***
