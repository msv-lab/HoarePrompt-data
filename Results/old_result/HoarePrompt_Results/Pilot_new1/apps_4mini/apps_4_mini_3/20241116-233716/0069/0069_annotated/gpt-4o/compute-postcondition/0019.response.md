Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in the string `s`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains initialized with zeros. If `n` is at least 1, after the loop executes, `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 based on `s[0]`, and subsequent `prefix_balances[i]` values are calculated accordingly.**
