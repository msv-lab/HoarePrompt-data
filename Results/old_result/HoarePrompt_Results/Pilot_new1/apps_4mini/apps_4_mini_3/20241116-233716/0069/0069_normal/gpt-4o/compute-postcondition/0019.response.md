Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index from 1 to `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, with length `n + 1`.**
