According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. If `prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, and `count` is 2 after the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `prefix_balances` must contain at least 3 elements, and `b` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 2, `b` is the third element in the list**
