Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1, while `assigned` remains unchanged and includes the elements processed so far, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, and `assigned` still includes the elements processed so far. In either case, `assigned` is not empty, as the loop would not execute if it were.***
