The value of `m` is incremented by 1, changing `m` from 2 to 3. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 1**
