Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[2]` and `x` is in `assigned`. `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. If the difference is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, `m` stays unchanged, and the values of `assigned`, `i`, and `n` remain the same.***
