The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
