The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `assigned` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `x` is the fourth element in the list `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
