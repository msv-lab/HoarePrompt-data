Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not satisfied, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the flow continues beyond this block.***
