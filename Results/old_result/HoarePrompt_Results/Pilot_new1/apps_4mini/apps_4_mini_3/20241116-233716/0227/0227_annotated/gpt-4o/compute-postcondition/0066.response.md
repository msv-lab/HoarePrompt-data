Output State: **If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1; `assigned` now includes `a[i]`; `i` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than the final value of `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i` before the loop starts, the values of `m`, `i`, and `assigned` remain unchanged. If `can_form` is True, the values of `m`, `i`, and `assigned` also remain unchanged.**
