The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of the set `assigned`.
