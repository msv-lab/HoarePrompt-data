Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the third element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating a valid formation is possible, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing without any specific assignment to `can_form` in this block.***
