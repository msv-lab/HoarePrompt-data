The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element (including `a[2]`), `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
