Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (where `x` is the first element of `assigned`) exists in the list `assigned`. The values of `m`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged at 2, 2, and at least 2 respectively, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, and the values of `m`, `i`, and `n` are still 2, 2, and at least 2 respectively, without any modifications to `assigned`.***
