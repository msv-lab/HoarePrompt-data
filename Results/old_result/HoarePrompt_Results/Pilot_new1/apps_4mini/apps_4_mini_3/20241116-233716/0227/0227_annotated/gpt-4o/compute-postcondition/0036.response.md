According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `assigned` list. If `assigned` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains at least one more element, and `m` has been incremented by 1. 

Since the loop iterates over `assigned`, for the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` must still contain at least one more element, and the next value of `x` must be the next element in the `assigned` list. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `assigned` still has at least one more element and that `x` is updated to the next element in the list.

State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains at least one more element, `x` is the next element in the list `assigned`**
