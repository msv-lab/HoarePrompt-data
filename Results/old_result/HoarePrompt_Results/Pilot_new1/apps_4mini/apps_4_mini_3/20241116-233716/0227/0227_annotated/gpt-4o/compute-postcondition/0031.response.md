Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (where `x` is the first element in `assigned`) exists in `assigned`, resulting in `m` being incremented by 1. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, `m` is still incremented by 1, and the state remains unchanged with respect to the elements in `assigned` and the value of `i`.***
