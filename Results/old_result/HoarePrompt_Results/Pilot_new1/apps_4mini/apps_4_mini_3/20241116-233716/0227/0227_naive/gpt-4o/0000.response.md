To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code and see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Summary:
We need to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform a sequence of operations based on the input sequence of distinct integers. The operations involve assigning values to variables and summing them up to produce the required values in the sequence.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        assigned.add(a[i])
    return m
```

1. **Sorting the Input**: The array `a` is sorted, which is necessary to ensure that we are processing the smallest numbers first.
2. **Initialization**: The first element of `a` is assigned to the first variable, and `m` is initialized to 1.
3. **Checking for Possible Formations**: For each subsequent element in `a`, the program checks if it can be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned values.
4. **Incrementing `m`**: If it cannot be formed, it increments the count of variables `m`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Cases**: The code does not account for the scenario where even the first number cannot be formed by any combination of previously assigned variables. If `a[i]` is less than twice the smallest assigned value, it cannot be formed, and the program should return -1.
2. **Edge Cases**: For instance, if `n = 1` and `a = [1]`, it should return `1` since only one variable is needed. However, if `a = [3]`, it should also return `1`. But if `a = [2, 5]`, it should return `-1` since `5` cannot be formed using any combinations of numbers less than itself.

### Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The output should be `-1` because `5` cannot be formed from any previously assigned variables.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases where the required number cannot be formed, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
