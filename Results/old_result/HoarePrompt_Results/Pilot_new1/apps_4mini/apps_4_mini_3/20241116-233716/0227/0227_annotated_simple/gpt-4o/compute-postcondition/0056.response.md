Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `assigned`. If the value `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains True, but the break statement is not executed, and the program continues executing the following statements.***
