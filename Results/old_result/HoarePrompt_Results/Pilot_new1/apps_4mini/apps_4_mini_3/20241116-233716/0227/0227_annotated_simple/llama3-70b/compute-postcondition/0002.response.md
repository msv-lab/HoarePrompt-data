The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as sorting does not affect the number of elements. The output state reflects the sorted order of the list `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers**
