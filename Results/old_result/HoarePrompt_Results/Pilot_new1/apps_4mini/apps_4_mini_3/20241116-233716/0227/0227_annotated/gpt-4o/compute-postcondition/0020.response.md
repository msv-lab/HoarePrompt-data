Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` contains fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. If `n` is at least 2 and `assigned` contains distinct positive integers, the loop will execute at most `len(assigned)` times, where `len(assigned)` is the number of elements in `assigned`.**
