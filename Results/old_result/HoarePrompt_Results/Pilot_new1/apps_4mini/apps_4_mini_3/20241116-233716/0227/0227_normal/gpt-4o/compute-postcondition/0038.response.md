The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `x`, and `assigned` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
