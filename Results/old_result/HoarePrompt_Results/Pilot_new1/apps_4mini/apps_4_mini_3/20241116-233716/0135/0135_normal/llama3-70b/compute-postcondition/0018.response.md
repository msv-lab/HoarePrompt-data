The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will stop executing further code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 and possibly 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'.
