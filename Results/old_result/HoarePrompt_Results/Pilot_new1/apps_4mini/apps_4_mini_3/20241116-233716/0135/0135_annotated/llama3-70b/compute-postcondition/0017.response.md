The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder`) are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains the value of `remainder` added to it, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is updated to `n % 3, and the output is 'No'**.
