The code `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The previous state indicates that `remainder` is `n % 3`, and `seen` may already contain the values 0 and possibly 1. 

If `remainder` is not already in `seen`, it will be added. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program would have already output 'No' and exited before this point, which means we can assume that `remainder` is not in `seen` at this moment.

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables will be:
- `seen` now includes the value of `remainder` (which is `n % 3`).
- Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0, possibly 1, and `remainder` is `n % 3`, and `seen` now includes `remainder`.**
