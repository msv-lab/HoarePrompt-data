The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` contains `0` and `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No' before the program exits.
