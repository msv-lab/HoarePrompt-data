Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that may contain the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the output is 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues without outputting 'No'.***
