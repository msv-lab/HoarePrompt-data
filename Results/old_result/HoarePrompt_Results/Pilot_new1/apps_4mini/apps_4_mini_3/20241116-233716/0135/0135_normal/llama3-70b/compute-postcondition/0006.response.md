The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This does not change the values of the variables, but it ends the execution. Therefore, the output state remains the same with a note that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, the output is 'No', and the program has exited.**
