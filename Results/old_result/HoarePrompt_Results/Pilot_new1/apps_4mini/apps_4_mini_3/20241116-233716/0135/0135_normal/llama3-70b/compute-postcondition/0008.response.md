The code `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The initial state indicates that `remainder` is 0. The variable `seen` may or may not already contain the value 0. Regardless, after executing this line, the state of `seen` will reflect that 0 is now included in it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0**
