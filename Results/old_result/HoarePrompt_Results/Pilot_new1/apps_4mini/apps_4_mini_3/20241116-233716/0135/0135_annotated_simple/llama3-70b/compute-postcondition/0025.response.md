Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks for duplicate remainders. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle the case when `k` is 0 or negative, which would result in no output or checks being performed. **
