The code increments `remocrats` by 1. The initial value of `remocrats` is 0, so after the execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1.
