According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. The loop iterates over each character in `fractions`. Since `fraction` is currently the third character of `fractions`, for the loop to execute one more time, `fraction` must be updated to the fourth character in the string.

Given that `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, we need to ensure that it has at least 4 characters for the loop to continue. Therefore, we can state that `fractions` must be a string of length at least 4, `fraction` must be the fourth character of `fractions`, and the loop variable `fraction` should be updated to this new character.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 4, `fraction` is the fourth character of `fractions`.**
