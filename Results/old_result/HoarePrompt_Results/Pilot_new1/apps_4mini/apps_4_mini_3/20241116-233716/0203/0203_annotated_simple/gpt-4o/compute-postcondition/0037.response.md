The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `r_queue` is non-empty and has one fewer element than before, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element. The value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value appended to `r_queue`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed, `d_index` is the removed first element, `r_queue` is non-empty with one additional element, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element.**
