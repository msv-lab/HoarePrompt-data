Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is not empty and `r_queue` has at least 1 element remaining. If `d_index` (the first element of `d_queue`) is less than `r_index` (the removed first element of `r_queue`), then `d_queue` has an additional element `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has an additional element `r_index + n`. In both cases, the values of `d_index` and `r_index` remain unchanged after the operation.***
