The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, `fraction` is the third character in `fractions`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, `fraction` is the third character in `fractions`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.**
