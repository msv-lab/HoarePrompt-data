The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n`, consisting solely of the characters 'D' and 'R'. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the contents of the `fractions` string. However, the exact return value based on the conditions specified in the output is not provided. Therefore, we can only summarize the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
