Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed, `d_index` is the removed first element, `r_queue` is non-empty with one element removed, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. This ensures that both queues remain non-empty after the operation, with the appropriate element added based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`.***
