The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown. The values of `n` and `fractions` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, and `remocrats` is increased by 1**
