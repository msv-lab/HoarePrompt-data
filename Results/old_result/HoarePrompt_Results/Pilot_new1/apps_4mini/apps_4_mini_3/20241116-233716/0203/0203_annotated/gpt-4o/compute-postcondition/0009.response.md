Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; if the first character `v` of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the index 0 and `r_queue` remains empty; otherwise, `d_queue` is empty and `r_queue` contains the index 0, indicating that `v` is not 'D'.***
