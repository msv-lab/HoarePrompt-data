The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now a positive integer, while `votes` remains a string of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
