According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `fractions` string. The loop will iterate over the characters 'D' and 'R' in the `fractions` string. Since `n` is a positive integer, it indicates that the length of the `fractions` string is at least 1. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `fractions` is not an empty string and has at least one character. The variables `depublicans` and `remocrats` do not affect the loop's execution but will be updated during the loop's iterations.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `fractions` must contain at least one character, and the initial state of `fraction` should be the first character in the `fractions` string. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
