The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous state indicates that `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `n` is an unspecified value. The operation will result in a new element being added to `d_queue`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed, `d_index` is the removed first element, `r_queue` is non-empty with one fewer element, `r_index` is the value of the removed first element, and `d_queue` now has an additional element `d_index + n`.**
