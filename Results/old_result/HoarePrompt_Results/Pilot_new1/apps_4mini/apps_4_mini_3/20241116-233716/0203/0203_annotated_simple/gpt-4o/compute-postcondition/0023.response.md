The operation `d_queue.append(d_index + n)` appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`, but the exact values of `d_index` and `n` are not specified. However, we know that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200000. 

Since `d_index` is less than `r_index`, it implies that `d_index` is a valid integer, but we do not know its specific value. The append operation will add the result of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`, which will modify its state by increasing its length by one.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `d_queue`, which now includes the new element.

Output State: **`d_queue` is increased by one element with the value of `d_index + n`, `r_queue` has its first element removed, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `r_index` is assigned the value of the removed element from `r_queue`, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.**
