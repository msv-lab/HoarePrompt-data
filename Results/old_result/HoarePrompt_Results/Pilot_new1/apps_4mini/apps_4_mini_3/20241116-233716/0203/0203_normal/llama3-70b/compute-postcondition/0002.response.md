The variable `depublicans` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `depublicans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `depublicans` is 0**
