According to the code, the loop iterates over the string `fractions`. Since `n` is a positive integer and represents the length of the string `fractions`, it confirms that the string will have at least 1 character (either 'D' or 'R'). 

At the start of the loop, the variable `fraction` will take on the value of each character in the `fractions` string, starting from the first character. Therefore, the state of `fraction` needs to be initialized to the first character of `fractions`, and since `depublicans` and `remocrats` are initialized to 0, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
