The value of `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue`, which is removed from `d_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. This means that `d_queue` will now have one less element after this operation. The state of `r_queue` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` is not empty (now with one less element), `r_queue` has at least 2 elements, and `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty (now with one less element), `r_queue` has at least 2 elements, and `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`.**
