The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`, and `fraction` is equal to 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`, and `fraction` is equal to 'D'**
