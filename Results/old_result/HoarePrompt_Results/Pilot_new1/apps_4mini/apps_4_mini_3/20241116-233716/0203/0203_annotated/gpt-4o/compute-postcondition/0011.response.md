The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `d_queue` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is equal to `n`; `d_queue` now contains the value of `i`.**
