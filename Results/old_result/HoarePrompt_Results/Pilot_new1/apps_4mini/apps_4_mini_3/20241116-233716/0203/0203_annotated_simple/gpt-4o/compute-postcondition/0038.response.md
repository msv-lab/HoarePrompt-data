Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed, `d_index` is the removed first element, `r_queue` is non-empty with one fewer element, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` now contains an additional element `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` now contains an additional element `r_index + n`. This ensures that both queues are updated based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`.***
