Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` have one less element each, with `d_index` being the value of the removed element from `d_queue` and `r_index` being the value of the removed element from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one additional element, which is `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has one additional element, which is `r_index + n`.***
