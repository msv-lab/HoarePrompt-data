Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed; otherwise, if `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed. This means that if `votes` is an empty string, `d_queue` may contain indices of 'D' characters plus multiples of `n`, while `r_queue` may either be empty or contain indices of 'R' characters plus multiples of `n`. If both queues are empty, 'R' is printed. In all cases, the state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` remains unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
