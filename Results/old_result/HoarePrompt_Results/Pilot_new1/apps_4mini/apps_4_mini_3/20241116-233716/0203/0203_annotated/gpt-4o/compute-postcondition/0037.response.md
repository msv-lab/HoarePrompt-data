The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is derived from the removed first element of `r_queue`, and `n` is an additional value that has not been specified but is assumed to be a known integer. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` has at least 1 element remaining before the operation, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value of the removed first element of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` now contains one additional element equal to `r_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` has at least 1 element remaining, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value of the removed first element of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` now has an additional element `r_index + n`**
