The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed**
