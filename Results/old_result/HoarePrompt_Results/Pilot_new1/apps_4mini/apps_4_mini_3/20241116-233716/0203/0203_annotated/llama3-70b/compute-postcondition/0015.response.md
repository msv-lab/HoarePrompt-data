The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `fraction`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, `fraction` is the third character in `fractions`, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, `fraction` is the third character in `fractions`, and `depublicans` is increased by 1**
