The code assigns `True` to `used_cubes[i]`. Given that `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements initially set to `False`, the value at index `i` (which is currently 0) will now be `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to True, `found` is set to False, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]**
