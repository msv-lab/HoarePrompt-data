Postcondition: ***`found` is True if at least one `used_cubes[i]` was initially False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` for some `i` in the range of `n`. If such an `i` exists, the first corresponding `used_cubes[i]` is updated to True; otherwise, if no such `i` exists, all `used_cubes` remain unchanged. If `found` is False, the function returns False, indicating that either all `used_cubes[i]` were initially True, `digit` was not in any of the corresponding `cube_faces[i]`, or `n` is less than 1, preventing the loop from executing.***
