The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraint that `n` is an integer with a value between 1 and 3. Additionally, it works with cubes that contain exactly 6 integers, denoted as `a_{i}_{j}`, where each integer satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. The function's behavior is defined based on these constraints, though the specific output or return value is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to work with a defined number of cubes, each containing integers within the specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and cubes with 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), but does not return any specific output as per the provided information.**
