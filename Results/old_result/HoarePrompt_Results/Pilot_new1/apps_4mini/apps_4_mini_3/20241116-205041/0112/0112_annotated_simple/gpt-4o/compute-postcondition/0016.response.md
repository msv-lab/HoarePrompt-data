The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. Since `i` is 2, this means that the third element of the list `used_cubes` is now `True`. The other variables, `n`, `digits`, `digit`, and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `used_cubes` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[2]` is True**
