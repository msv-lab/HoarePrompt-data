According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. The loop will execute for each element in `digits`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it implies that `digits` must contain at least one digit for the loop to execute. Additionally, the loop will assign `digit` to the first element of `digits` during its first iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `digits` is not empty and that `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list. The `used_cubes` list is already initialized with `n` False values, which is appropriate according to the constraints.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` False values**
