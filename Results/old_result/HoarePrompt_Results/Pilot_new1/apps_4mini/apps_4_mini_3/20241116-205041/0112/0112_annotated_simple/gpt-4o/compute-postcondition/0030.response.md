Output State: **`used_cubes` will have some values set to True if there are corresponding `digit` values in `cube_faces` for at least one `i` where `used_cubes[i]` was initially False. If all `used_cubes[i]` were initially True or if none of the `digits` matched any of the `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `used_cubes` remains all False. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains all False.**
