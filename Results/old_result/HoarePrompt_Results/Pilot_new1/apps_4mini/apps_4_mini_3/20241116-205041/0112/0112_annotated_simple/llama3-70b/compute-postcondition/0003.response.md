According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it implies that `cubes` should be a list with a length of at least 1, corresponding to the value of `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `cube` will represent the last element of the `cubes` list. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `cubes` is a list with at least one element and that `cube` is the first element in the `cubes` list at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 element, `cube` is the first element in the `cubes` list**
