The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this operation, and since `digits` is now an empty set, the output state reflects that. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists based on user input; `digits` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists based on user input; `digits` is an empty set**
