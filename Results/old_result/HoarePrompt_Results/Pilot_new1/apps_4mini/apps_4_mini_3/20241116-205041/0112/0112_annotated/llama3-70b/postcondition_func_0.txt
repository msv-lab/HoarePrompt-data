The function accepts no parameters. It reads an integer `n` from input, followed by `n` lines of space-separated integers, which are stored in a list called `cubes`. It collects all unique digits from these integers, removes '0' if present, and then constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. Finally, it prints this maximum integer. If there are no digits (for example, if all inputs are zeros or if `n` is 0), the function will attempt to create a number but will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior since it does not handle the case of an empty `digits` set.
