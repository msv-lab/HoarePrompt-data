The variable `cubes` is assigned a list that is generated by a list comprehension. This comprehension runs `n` times (where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and for each iteration, it takes input from the user, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. 

Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, the resulting `cubes` will be a list containing 1, 2, or 3 lists of integers, depending on the user's input. The specific values for `cubes` cannot be determined without knowing the input, but its structure will be consistent with the number of iterations defined by `n`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on user input**
