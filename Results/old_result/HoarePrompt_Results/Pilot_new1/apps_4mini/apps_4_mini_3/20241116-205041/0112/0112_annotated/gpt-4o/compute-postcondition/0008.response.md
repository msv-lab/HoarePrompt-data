The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` has `i`th element as True, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
