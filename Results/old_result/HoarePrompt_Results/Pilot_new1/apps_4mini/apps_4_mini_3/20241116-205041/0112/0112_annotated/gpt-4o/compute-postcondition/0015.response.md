According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` must be less than `n`).

Therefore, since `n` is currently at most 3, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `i` is 2**
