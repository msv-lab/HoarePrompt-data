The code assigns `max_num` the value of the integer created by joining the sorted elements of `digits` in reverse order. The effect of this code depends on the content of `digits`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it has already been removed, ensuring that the largest possible number will not have a leading zero. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` would be an empty set, resulting in `max_num` being assigned an empty string, which would raise an error when converted to an integer.

Thus, the output state will depend on whether `digits` is empty or contains valid digit strings. 

If `digits` is empty:
- `max_num` would not be calculable, so we can state that `digits` is empty.

If `digits` contains strings of digits (after '0' removal):
- `max_num` would be the largest integer that can be formed from the sorted digits.

Since the task doesn't specify the exact state of `digits`, the output state will reflect the possible scenarios:

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of unique digits found in the lists within `cubes`; if empty, `max_num` is not calculable; if not empty, `max_num` is the integer formed by the sorted digits in reverse order.**
