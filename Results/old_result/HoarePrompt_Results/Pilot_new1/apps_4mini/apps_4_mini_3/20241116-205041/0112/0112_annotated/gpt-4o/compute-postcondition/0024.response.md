Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`. If `digit` is not found in any of the cube faces and `found` is False, the function returns False. If `n` is outside the specified bounds (less than 1 or greater than 3), this situation is not expected to occur based on the precondition, thus it is assumed that `found` would be appropriately set in valid cases.***
