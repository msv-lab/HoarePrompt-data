The variable `num` is expected to hold an integer value, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. The code converts `num` to a string, then creates a list of its digits by iterating over each character in the string representation of `num`. Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact content of `digits`. Therefore, the output state reflects the uncertainty regarding the specific value of `num` and the resulting list of digits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num` as strings**
