The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous value of `False`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the second element set to `True`, `found` is True, `i` is 1.
