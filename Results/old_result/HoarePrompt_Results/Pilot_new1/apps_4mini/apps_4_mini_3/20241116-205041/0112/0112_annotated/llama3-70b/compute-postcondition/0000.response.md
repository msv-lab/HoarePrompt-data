The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial constraints specify that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` has been assigned a value based on user input within the specified range. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
