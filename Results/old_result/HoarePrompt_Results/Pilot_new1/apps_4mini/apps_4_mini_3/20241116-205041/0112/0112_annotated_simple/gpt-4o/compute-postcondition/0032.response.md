The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Additionally, the function utilizes a list `cube_faces`, where each `cube_faces[i]` is a list of 6 integers, and each integer `a_{i}_{j}` satisfies 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. 

After executing the function body, there are two cases for the return value:

- Case_1: If `used_cubes` has some values set to True because there are corresponding `digit` values in `cube_faces` for at least one `i` where `used_cubes[i]` was initially False, then `used_cubes` will reflect these changes. If all `used_cubes[i]` were initially True or if none of the `digits` matched any of the `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1 or if `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains all False.

- Case_2: The program returns True if the conditions for Case_1 are satisfied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, and it determines if a number can be formed based on the digits and the corresponding cube faces, returning True if the conditions are met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and returns True if the number can be formed with the available cubes based on the digits; otherwise, it maintains the state of `used_cubes`.**
