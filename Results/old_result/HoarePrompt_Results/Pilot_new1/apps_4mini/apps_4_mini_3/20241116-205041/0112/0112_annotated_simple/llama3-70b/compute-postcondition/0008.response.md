The `digits` set is updated with the string representations of each digit in `cube`. Since `cube` is the third element in the `cubes` list, the specific digits in `cube` will be converted to strings and added to the `digits` set. The values of `n` and `cubes` are not directly affected by this operation, but we know `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 3, and `cubes` contains at least 3 elements. 

The output state reflects the updated state of `digits`, which now includes string representations of all digits in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 elements; `cube` is the third element in the `cubes` list; `digits` is updated with string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
