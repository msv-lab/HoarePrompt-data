Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element; `digit` is the first element in `digits`; `found` is False; `used_cubes` remains unchanged; there is no index `i` such that `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`.***
