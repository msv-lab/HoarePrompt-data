The code initializes a list `used_cubes` with `n` boolean values, all set to `False`. The value of `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, so the possible lengths of the list `used_cubes` can be 1, 2, or 3. The variable `digits` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `used_cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of length n with all values set to False**
