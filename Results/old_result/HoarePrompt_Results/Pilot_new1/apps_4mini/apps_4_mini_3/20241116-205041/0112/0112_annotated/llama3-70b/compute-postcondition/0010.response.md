The loop iterates through each list in the `cubes` list and updates the `digits` set with the string representations of each digit found in the current `cube`. The loop will execute as many times as there are lists in `cubes`, up to a maximum of 3, based on the initial state of `n`.

If `cubes` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `digits` will remain an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, the loop will execute at least once, and `digits` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **If `cubes` is a list with at least 1 list, `digits` will contain string representations of digits from all lists in `cubes`. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` will remain an empty set.**
