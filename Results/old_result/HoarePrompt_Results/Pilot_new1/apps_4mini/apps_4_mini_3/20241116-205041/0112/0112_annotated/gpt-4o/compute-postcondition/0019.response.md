Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `i` is 2. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[2]` is True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` remains unchanged and `found` remains unchanged.***
