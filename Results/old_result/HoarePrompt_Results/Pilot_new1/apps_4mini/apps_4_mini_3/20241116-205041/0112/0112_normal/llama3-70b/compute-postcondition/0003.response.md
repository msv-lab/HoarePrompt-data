According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list, which is guaranteed since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Therefore, `cubes` will have at least one element. 

At the end of the last iteration, `cube` will represent the last list in `cubes`. For the loop to be executed, we need to define the initial state of `cube` as the first list in `cubes` and ensure that `cubes` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
