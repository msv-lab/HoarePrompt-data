`used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has now been used. The previous value of `used_cubes[i]` was `False`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the list `used_cubes` will have a length of `n`, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` has `i`th element as True, `found` is False, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` has `i`th element as True, `found` is False, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]**
