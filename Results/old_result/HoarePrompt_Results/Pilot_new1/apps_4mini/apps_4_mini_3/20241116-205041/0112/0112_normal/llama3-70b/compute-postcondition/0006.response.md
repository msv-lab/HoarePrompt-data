The `digits` variable is updated to contain string representations of the integers in `cube`. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, the contents of `cube` will determine the new values in `digits`. The initial state indicates that `n` can be either 2 or 3, meaning `cubes` can have either 2 or 3 lists of integers. The specific contents of `cube` are not provided, but the operation will convert each integer in `cube` to its string representation and update `digits` accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
