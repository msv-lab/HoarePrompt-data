Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `i` is 1. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` remains False. Additionally, since `i` is initialized to 1, it is important to ensure that `i` does not exceed the bounds of the `used_cubes` list.***
