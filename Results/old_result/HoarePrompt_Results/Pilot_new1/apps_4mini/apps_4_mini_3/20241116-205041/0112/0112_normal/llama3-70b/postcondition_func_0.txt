The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lists of integers (each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9) from user input. It collects all unique digit representations from these lists into a set called `digits`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. The function then constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order and prints this integer. The function does not return any value. If `n` is 0, no input is processed, and the function does not produce any output.
