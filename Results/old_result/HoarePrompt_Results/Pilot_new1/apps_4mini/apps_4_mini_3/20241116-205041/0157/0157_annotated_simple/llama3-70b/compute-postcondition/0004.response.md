The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` calculates a value based on `min_lemon`. The variable `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `min_lemon`.

Calculating the expression:
- The expression simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `min_lemon * 7`.

The output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `min_lemon`, along with the computed result.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a new positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the result is `min_lemon * 7`.**
