The value of `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a new positive integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `a` and `c` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a new positive integer, `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a new positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
