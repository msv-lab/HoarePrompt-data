Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the required ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the constraints:
   - For every lemon, 2 apples are needed, hence it checks `b // 2`.
   - For every lemon, 4 pears are needed, hence it checks `c // 4`.
   - The limiting factor is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
3. It calculates the total number of fruits used by multiplying the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) by the respective ratios (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears).
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

The program correctly handles the edge case where not enough fruits are available to make even one complete set (e.g., when there are not enough pears). In such cases, `max_lemons` will be 0, resulting in a total of 0 fruits being printed.

All provided examples from the problem statement yield the expected results, confirming that the program is functioning correctly for the specified input range. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
