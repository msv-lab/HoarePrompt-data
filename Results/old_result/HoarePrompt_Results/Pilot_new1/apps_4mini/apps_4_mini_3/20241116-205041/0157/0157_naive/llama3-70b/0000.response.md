Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote in the required ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.

2. **Minimum Calculation**: It calculates `min_lemon`, which is the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and their required ratios:
   - `a` is the number of lemons available.
   - `b // 2` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with apples, as each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - `c // 4` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with pears, as each lemon requires 4 pears.
   - The minimum of these three values ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available fruits based on the recipe's requirements.

3. **Total Calculation**: The total number of fruits used is calculated as:
   - `min_lemon` (lemons) + `min_lemon * 2` (apples) + `min_lemon * 4` (pears), which sums up to `min_lemon * 7`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases:
   - If any of the fruits are insufficient to meet the ratio requirements (e.g., not enough pears), `min_lemon` will be zero, resulting in a total of zero, which matches the expected output.

Thus, the logic implemented in the program adheres to the problem description, and I could not find any input case where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
