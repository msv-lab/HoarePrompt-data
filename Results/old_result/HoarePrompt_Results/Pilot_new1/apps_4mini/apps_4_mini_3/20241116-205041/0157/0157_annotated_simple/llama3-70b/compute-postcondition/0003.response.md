The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but `min_lemon` will hold the smallest value of the three expressions. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a new positive integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a new positive integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
