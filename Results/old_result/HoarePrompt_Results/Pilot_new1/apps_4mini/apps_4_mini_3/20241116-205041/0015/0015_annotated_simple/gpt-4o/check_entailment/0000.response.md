To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` where:
   - `a` is the first element of the sequence.
   - `b` is Vasya's favorite integer.
   - `c` is the common difference between consecutive elements of the sequence.
   
2. **Output**: The program should print "YES" if `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the difference `c`, otherwise print "NO".

### Sequence Definition:
The sequence can be represented as:
- `s_1 = a`
- `s_2 = a + c`
- `s_3 = a + 2c`
- ...
- `s_i = a + (i - 1)c`

The condition for `b` to be in the sequence is:
- There exists a positive integer `i` such that `b = a + (i - 1)c`.

### Analyzing the Code:
```python
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (b == a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        if (c == 0):
            print('NO')
        else:
            if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

#### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Check if `b` equals `a`**: If yes, print "YES".
2. **Check if `c` equals `0`**: If yes and `b` is not equal to `a`, print "NO". This is correct because if `c` is `0`, the sequence does not change and can only contain the value `a`.
3. **For non-zero `c`**:
   - Check if `(b - a) % c == 0`: This checks if `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`.
   - Check if `(b - a) / c >= 0`: This ensures that `b` is reached in a positive number of steps.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `c` is negative**: 
   - If `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = -5`, the sequence would be `10, 5, 0, -5, ...`. The program should return "YES" since `b` is in the sequence.
   - The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` will yield a negative result, which is correct as it indicates that `b` is reached in the opposite direction.

2. **Case when `c` is positive**:
   - If `a = 1`, `b = 7`, and `c = 3`, the sequence is `1, 4, 7, ...`. The program should return "YES".
   
3. **Case when `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive**:
   - If `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = 5`, the sequence is `10, 15, 20, ...`. The program should return "NO", which it does.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as outlined in the problem description. There are no edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
