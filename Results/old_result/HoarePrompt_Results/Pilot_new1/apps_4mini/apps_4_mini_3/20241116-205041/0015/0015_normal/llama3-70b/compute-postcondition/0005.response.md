The code prints the string 'NO', which does not change the values of any variables. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is 0, and 'NO' is printed**
