The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The initial state indicates that `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, but since there are no assignments or changes to these variables, they remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is equal to `b`, `c` is 0, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b`, `c` is 0, and 'YES' is printed**
