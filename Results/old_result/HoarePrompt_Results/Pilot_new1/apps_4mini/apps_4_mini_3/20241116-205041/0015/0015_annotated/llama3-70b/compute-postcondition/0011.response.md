The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9; `c` is not equal to 0; the expression `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is negative; and the output is 'NO'.**
