The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal or 'NO' if they are not. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. It prints 'YES' if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This includes edge cases where `b` is less than `a` with positive `c`, resulting in 'NO', or `b` is greater than `a` with negative `c`, also resulting in 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
