The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that are constrained by the condition -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the specific return value is not defined in the given context.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with integers a, b, and c constrained between -10^9 and 10^9, but the return value is not specified.**
