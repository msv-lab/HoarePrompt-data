The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state is that `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b`, `c` is 0, and the output is 'YES'**
