The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement has been executed successfully.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is not equal to 0; the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`; and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer; and the function prints 'YES'.**
