Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9 and `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the function prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the function prints 'YES' if the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.***
