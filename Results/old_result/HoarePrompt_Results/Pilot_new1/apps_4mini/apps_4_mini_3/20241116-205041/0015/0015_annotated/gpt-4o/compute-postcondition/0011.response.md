Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division of (b - a) by c is non-negative, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This covers all cases including when (b - a) is positive, zero, or negative, as long as the divisibility condition is satisfied.***
