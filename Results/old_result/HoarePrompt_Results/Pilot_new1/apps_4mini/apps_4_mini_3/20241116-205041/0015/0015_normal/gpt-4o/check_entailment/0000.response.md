To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if a number `b` appears in a sequence defined as:
- The first element is `a` (s_1 = a).
- The difference between consecutive elements is `c` (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c).

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_{i} = b`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Check if `b` equals `a`:** 
   - If `b` is equal to `a`, the output is "YES", which is correct since `b` is indeed in the sequence (the first element).

2. **Check if `c` is zero:**
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence does not change and consists of only the element `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a`, the output is "NO", which is also correct.

3. **Check if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative:**
   - The condition `(b - a) % c == 0` checks if `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`.
   - The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., `b` is not behind `a` when `c` is positive or not ahead of `a` when `c` is negative).

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when `c = 0`:** The program correctly handles this case by checking if `b` is equal to `a`. If they are not equal, it outputs "NO".
- **Case when `c` is negative:** The program correctly handles this by ensuring that `(b - a) / c >= 0` to confirm that `b` is not ahead of `a`.
- **Case when `c` is positive:** The program checks that `b` can be reached from `a` with the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0`.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function correctly checks all scenarios:
1. It prints "YES" if `b` is equal to `a`.
2. It prints "NO" if `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`.
3. It prints "YES" if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative.
4. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, including edge cases. The output hints align with the logic of the code.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
