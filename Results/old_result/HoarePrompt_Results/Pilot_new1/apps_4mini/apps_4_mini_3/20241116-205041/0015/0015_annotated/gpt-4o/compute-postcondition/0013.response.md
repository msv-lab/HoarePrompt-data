Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative result from the division, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This covers all scenarios, including cases where `c` is positive or negative, and where `(b - a)` can be positive, zero, or negative.***
