The `print` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is equal to `a`, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is equal to `a`, and 'YES' is printed**
