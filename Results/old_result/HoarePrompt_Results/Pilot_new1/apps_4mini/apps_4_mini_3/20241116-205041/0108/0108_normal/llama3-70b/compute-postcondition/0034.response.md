According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue executing as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next ASCII character of `char`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain `char`. Since `char` has been replaced with its next ASCII character, it is necessary to ensure that the new character (which is now in `s` instead of `char`) is still present in `s` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, `s` must be adjusted to include the original `char` again, meaning that `s` should still contain the original `char` after the replacement.

State: **`s` must contain the original `char`**
