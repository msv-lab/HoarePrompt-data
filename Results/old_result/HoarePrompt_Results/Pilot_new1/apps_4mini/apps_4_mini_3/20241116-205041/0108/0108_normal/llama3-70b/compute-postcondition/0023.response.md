According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next Unicode character. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the modified `s`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that after the modification, `char` is still in `s`. This means that the next Unicode character that replaced the first occurrence of `char` must not be the same as `char` itself (to avoid removing all occurrences). Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char` after the modification.

State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `char`, `s` contains at least one occurrence of char**
