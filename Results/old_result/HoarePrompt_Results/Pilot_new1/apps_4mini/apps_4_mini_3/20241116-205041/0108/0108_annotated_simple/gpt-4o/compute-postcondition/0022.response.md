Postcondition: ***`s` is a string. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, the function prints `target`. If `j` is less than 26, indicating that `s` does not contain all characters from `target`, the function prints -1. In the case where `s` is empty, both `i` and `j` are 0, leading to the output of -1. If `s` contains all characters from `target`, `j` is 26 and `i` is equal to the length of `s`, resulting in the printing of `target`.***
