The variables `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.
