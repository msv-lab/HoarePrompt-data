According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next ASCII character. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain the character that was originally `char` before the replacement. 

To ensure that `char` is still in `s`, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `s` must contain `char` after the replacement. Therefore, we need to specify that `s` must still have at least one occurrence of `char` left.

State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `char`; `s` has at least one occurrence of `char`**
