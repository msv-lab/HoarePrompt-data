According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet`. If `alphabet` has more characters remaining after the current `char`, the loop will execute again. Since the state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `char` is the next ASCII character after the last occurrence of `next_char`, it implies that `char` is not the last character in the `alphabet`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `char` is updated to the next character in the `alphabet` after the current `char`. Additionally, since the loop will continue until all characters in the `alphabet` are processed, we need to confirm that `s` still has occurrences of `next_char` for the loop body to have executed previously.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `char` should be updated to the next character in the `alphabet`.
- `s` should still contain occurrences of `next_char` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` contains occurrences of `next_char`, `res` is unchanged, `char` is the next character in the alphabet**
