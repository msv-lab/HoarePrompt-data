To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop.

The loop will continue executing as long as both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are true. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `i` is 1
- `target_len` is 26 (which is constant)
- `len(s)` is not explicitly stated, but since `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, we can infer that `len(s)` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `i` is currently 1, `len(s)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
2. `j` must be less than `target_len`. We do not have the current value of `j`, but for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 26.

Since `len(s)` is not provided explicitly, we cannot determine its exact value, but we can state that it must be greater than 1. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop can execute one more time are:
- `len(s)` must be greater than 1.
- `j` must be less than 26.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is less than 26**
