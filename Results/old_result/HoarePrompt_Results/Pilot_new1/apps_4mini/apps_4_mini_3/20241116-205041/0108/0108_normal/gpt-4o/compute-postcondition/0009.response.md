The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is less than 26, so after execution, `j` will be at least 1 and less than or equal to 26. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is less than or equal to 26 after increment.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is less than or equal to 26 after increment**
