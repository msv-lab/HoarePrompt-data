According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as `char` is found in `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`, indicating that `char` was found and processed.
- `s` has been updated such that the first occurrence of `char` has been replaced by the next character in ASCII.
- `char` is still present in `s`, which means the loop can execute again.

Since `char` is still in `s`, there is no need to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `char` is still in `s`, and `res` now contains one more `char`**
