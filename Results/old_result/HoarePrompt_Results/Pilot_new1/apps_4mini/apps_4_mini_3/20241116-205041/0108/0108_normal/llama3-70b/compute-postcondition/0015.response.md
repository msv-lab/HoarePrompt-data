The code appends the character `char` to the string `res`. The previous state of `res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s`, and the next character to be processed is 'd'. Therefore, after executing `res += char`, the state of `res` will include the character `char`, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `char`, and the next character to be processed is 'd'.**
