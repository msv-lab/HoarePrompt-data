The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it contains all the characters from 'a' to 'z' in order. If it does, it prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle cases where `s` is empty or does not contain the required characters, resulting in -1 being printed in such cases. Additionally, the function has a potential issue where it may attempt to print an undefined variable `target` if the condition is met.
