The code increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state does not provide the current value of `i`, but it indicates that `i` is being modified. Other variables, such as `s` and `j`, are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `i` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1**
