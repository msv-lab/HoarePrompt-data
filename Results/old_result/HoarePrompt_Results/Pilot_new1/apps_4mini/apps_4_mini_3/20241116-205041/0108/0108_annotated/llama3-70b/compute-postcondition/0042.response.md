Postcondition: ***`res` is a string containing all occurrences of each character from 'a' to 'z' found in `s`, in the order of their appearance. If the length of `res` is equal to 26, the function prints `res`. If `res` contains fewer than 26 occurrences of characters from 'a' to 'z', `s` remains unchanged, and the function prints -1. Additionally, if `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` remains an empty string, and `s` remains unchanged, resulting in the function also printing -1.***
