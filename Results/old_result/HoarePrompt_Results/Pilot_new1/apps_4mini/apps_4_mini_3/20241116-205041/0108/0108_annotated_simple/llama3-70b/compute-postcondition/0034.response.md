According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` no longer contains the first occurrence of `char`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain at least one occurrence of `char`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `s` contains `char` again. This can be done by stating that `s` must now contain at least one occurrence of `char`.

State: **`res` is 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, and `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`**
