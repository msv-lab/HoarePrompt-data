Postcondition: ***`res` is a string that contains fewer than 26 characters, indicating that not all characters from 'a' to 'z' were present in `s` or could be replaced. `s` remains unchanged, and any characters in `s` that were 'a' to 'y' may have been replaced by their subsequent ASCII characters, while 'z' remains unchanged and does not contribute to `res`.***
