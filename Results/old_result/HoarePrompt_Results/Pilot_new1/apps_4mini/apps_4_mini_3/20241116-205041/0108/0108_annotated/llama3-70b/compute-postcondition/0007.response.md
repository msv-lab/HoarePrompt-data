The code `res += char` appends the value of `char`, which is 'a', to the existing value of `res`, which is also 'a'. Therefore, after execution, `res` will be 'aa'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` originally contained at least two occurrences of 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
