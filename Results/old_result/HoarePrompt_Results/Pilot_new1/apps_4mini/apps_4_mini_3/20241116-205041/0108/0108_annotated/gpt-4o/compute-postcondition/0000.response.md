The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input consisting of lowercase English letters. The length of `s` can range from 1 to 100,000 characters. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, and `s` is an input string**.
