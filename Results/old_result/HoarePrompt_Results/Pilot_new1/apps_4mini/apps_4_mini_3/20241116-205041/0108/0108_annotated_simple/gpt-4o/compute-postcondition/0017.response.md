The loop iterates through the string `s` while checking for the presence of characters in the `target` string, which consists of all lowercase English letters. The loop will continue until either all characters in `s` have been checked (i.e., `i` reaches `len(s)`) or all characters in `target` have been found in `s` (i.e., `j` reaches `target_len`).

If `s` contains all the characters from `target`, then after the loop finishes, `j` will equal `target_len` (26), and `i` will be equal to the length of `s`. If `s` does not contain all characters from `target`, then `j` will be less than `target_len`, and `i` will be equal to the length of `s` or less, depending on how many characters were matched.

If `s` is an empty string, the loop will not execute at all, leaving `i` at 0 and `j` at 0.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`if s is an empty string then i is 0 and j is 0. if s contains all characters from target then j is 26 and i is len(s). if s does not contain all characters from target then i is len(s) and j is less than 26.`**
