Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where it is impossible to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" from the input string. 

For example, consider the input string "aaa". In this case, the program will attempt to replace 'a' with 'b', and since 'b' is not present, it will not be able to move forward in the alphabet. The program will end up with an empty result string and will print `-1`, which is incorrect because it should have been impossible to form the sequence from the start.

Additionally, the program does not consider the case where there are not enough characters in the input string to form the complete alphabet subsequence. For instance, if the input is "abcdefghij", the output will be `-1`, which is correct, but if the input is "aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz", the program incorrectly processes this string and ends up with more characters than needed, leading to an incorrect output. 

Thus, the program fails to handle these edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.
