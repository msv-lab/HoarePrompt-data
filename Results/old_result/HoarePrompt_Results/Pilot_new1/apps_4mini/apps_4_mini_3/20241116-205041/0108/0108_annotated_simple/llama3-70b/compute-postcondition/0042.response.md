Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z' that have been replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence based on their occurrences in `s`, except for 'z', which remains unchanged. If `res` contains all characters from 'b' to 'z', the function prints `res`. Otherwise, if `res` contains fewer than 26 characters, `s` remains unchanged, and -1 is printed. If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is an empty string, and the function prints -1.***
