Postcondition: ***If `j` equals `target_len`, the function attempts to print `target`, which is not defined, leading to an error. If `j` is not equal to `target_len`, it indicates that `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z', with `j` being less than 26 and `i` being less than the length of `s`, resulting in the function printing -1.***
