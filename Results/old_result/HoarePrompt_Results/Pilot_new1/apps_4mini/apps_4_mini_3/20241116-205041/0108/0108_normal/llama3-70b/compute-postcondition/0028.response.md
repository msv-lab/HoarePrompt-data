According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `s` has `next_char` present, and `res` is updated to include `char`. Additionally, `s` has been modified to replace the first occurrence of `char` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the updated `s`. Since `char` was replaced with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`, we need to ensure that this new value of `char` is also present in `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `s` contains `chr(ord(char) + 1)`.

State: **`if char is in s then res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `next_char`, and `s` contains `chr(ord(char) + 1)` present**
