Output State: **If `next_char` is present in `s`, then `res` contains the characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `next_char` and subsequent characters until `next_char` is no longer in `s`. After the loop ends, `s` will have no occurrences of `next_char` and `char` will be the next ASCII character after the last occurrence of `next_char`. If `next_char` is not in `s` at the start, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged.**
