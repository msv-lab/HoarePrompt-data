To determine the output state based on the provided initial state and code snippet, we analyze the effect of the code on the variable `dp[n, k]`.

1. If `k` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `dp[n, k]` remains 9.
2. If `k` is between 2 and 10, the expression will update `dp[n, k]` based on the formula provided. The formula calculates the contribution to `dp[n, k]` by iterating `i` from 1 to `k-1`, using the current value of `n`.

The output state will depend on the value of `k`:
- If `k` is 1, then `dp[n, k]` remains 9.
- If `k` is between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` will be updated according to the formula.

Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `dp[n, k]` when `k` is between 2 and 10. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible outcomes based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9; if `k` is between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula.**
