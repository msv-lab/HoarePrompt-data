Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the tuple (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value associated with that key. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n`. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is set to 9; for `k` between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` is calculated based on a formula involving powers of 10 and is then taken modulo `MOD`. The overall state of `dp[n, k]` reflects these assignments and calculations based on the value of `n` and `k`.***
