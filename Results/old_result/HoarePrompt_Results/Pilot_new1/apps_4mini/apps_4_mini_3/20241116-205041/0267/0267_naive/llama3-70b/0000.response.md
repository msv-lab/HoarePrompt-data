To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation of the `func_1` function and ensure it meets the requirements outlined in the problem.

The problem requires calculating the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. The program uses a recursive `count` function with memoization to compute the number of valid integers up to `n` that fit the criteria, and then it calculates the sum for the range `[l, r]`.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Minimum Values**: 
   - If `l = 1`, `r = 1`, and `k = 1`, the program should return `1`, which is valid since `1` contains only one digit.
   - If `l = 1`, `r = 1`, and `k = 2`, the program should also return `1`, which is valid since `1` contains only one digit and is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Single Digit Range**:
   - For `l = 5`, `r = 5`, and `k = 1`, the output should be `5` since `5` is a valid number with one digit.
   - For `l = 5`, `r = 5`, and `k = 2`, the output should still be `5`.

3. **Large Range with High `k`**:
   - For `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 1`, the output should be `110` (as confirmed in the problem statement).
   - For `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 2`, the output should be `1230` (as confirmed in the problem statement).

4. **Edge Cases with Leading Zeros**:
   - The function should handle numbers that could be formed by leading zeros, which are not valid integers. For instance, if `l = 100` and `r = 1000`, but `k = 1`, it should not count numbers like `000`, `001`, etc.

5. **Large Values**:
   - Given the constraints (`1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18`), we need to ensure that the program can handle large values correctly without causing overflow or incorrect calculations.

### Issues Identified:
Upon reviewing the implementation, there is a potential flaw in how the counting of valid numbers is handled. The recursive function `count` does not seem to correctly account for all valid numbers when `k` is greater than 1, particularly in the way it computes the number of digits and combinations of digits. 

For example, the logic for counting numbers with exactly `k` digits does not seem to be explicitly defined, and the handling of cases where the number of different digits exceeds `k` could lead to incorrect counts. 

### Conclusion:
Due to the potential issues with counting valid numbers based on the number of different digits, the program may not correctly compute the sum for all ranges and values of `k`. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem requirements for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when `k` is greater than 1, leading to potentially incorrect sums being calculated.
