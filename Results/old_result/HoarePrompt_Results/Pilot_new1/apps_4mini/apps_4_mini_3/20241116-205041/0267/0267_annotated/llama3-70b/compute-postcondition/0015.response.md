The expression updates `dp[n, k]` by adding a calculated value based on the formula. The formula involves `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. 

Here, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1. The specific calculations are as follows:

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`:
   - Since `i` is 1, `10 ** (1 - 1)` equals `10 ** 0`, which is `1`.

2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`:
   - Since `k` is greater than 1, `10 ** (k - 1)` is a power of 10 that is greater than `1`.

3. Substitute the values into the formula:
   - The formula becomes `9 * 1 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.

4. Therefore, `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.

The output state reflects that `dp[n, k]` has been updated with the new value derived from the calculations, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to include an increment based on `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
