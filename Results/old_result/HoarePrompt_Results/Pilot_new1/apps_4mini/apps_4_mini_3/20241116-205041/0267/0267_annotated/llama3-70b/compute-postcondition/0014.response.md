According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value before the loop increments it, which is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `k`. 

Since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `k - 1`, `i` must be incremented to `k`, which means `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed at least once. Therefore, to allow for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be greater than `1` and `i` needs to be set to `1`.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to include an increment based on the formula involving `9 * 10`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
