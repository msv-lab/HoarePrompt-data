According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is `r + 1`, which means the range is effectively empty and the loop cannot execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` is currently `r + 1`, it needs to be set to `r + 1` to `r`, making `l` equal to `r` and allowing the loop to iterate over at least one value. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `r` remains unchanged, and `k` and `total_sum` are not directly affected by the loop's execution condition.

State: **`l` is `r`, `r` is unchanged, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` remains 0.**
