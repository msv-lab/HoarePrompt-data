Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, which reflects the addition of `num` to `total_sum` modulo `MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns False, `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0. Additionally, `r` is incremented by 1 to account for the range adjustment.***
