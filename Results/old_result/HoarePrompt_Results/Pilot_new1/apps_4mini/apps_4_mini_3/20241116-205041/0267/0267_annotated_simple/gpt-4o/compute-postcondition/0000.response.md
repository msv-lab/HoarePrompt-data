The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The other variables `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `total_sum` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0**
