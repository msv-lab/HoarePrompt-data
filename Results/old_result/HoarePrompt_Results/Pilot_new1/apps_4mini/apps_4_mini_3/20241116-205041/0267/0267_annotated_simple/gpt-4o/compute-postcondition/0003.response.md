The code updates `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`, which is an integer within the range specified. The value of `MOD` is assumed to be a predefined constant (not specified in the initial state). 

1. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0.
2. The value of `num` is `l`.
3. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `total_sum` and the unchanged values of `l`, `r`, and `k`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
