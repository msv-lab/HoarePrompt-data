According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more tuples in the `buses` list beyond the current index `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `buses` has at least 2 tuples, which means the current tuple is the second one. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` must be incremented to 2, and the current tuple `(s, d)` must be updated to the third tuple in the `buses` list.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `(s, d)` is the third tuple in the buses list**
