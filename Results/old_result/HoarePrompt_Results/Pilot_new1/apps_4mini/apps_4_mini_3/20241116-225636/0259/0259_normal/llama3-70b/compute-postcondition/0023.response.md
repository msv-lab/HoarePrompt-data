Output State: **`buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `min_time` is updated to `time`, `ans` is set to 2, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`; `min_time` is now equal to `time`.**
