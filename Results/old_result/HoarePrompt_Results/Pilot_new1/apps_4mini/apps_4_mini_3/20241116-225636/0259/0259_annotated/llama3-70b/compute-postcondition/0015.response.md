According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. The loop will iterate through each tuple in the `buses` list, and during the first iteration, `i` will be 0, and `s` and `d` will be the first elements of the first tuple in the list.

For the loop to be executed, the `buses` list must have at least 1 tuple. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `buses` is a list with at least one tuple, and during the first iteration, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple, and `d` is the second element of the first tuple.

State: **`buses` is a list with at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is float('inf'), `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in buses, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in buses**
