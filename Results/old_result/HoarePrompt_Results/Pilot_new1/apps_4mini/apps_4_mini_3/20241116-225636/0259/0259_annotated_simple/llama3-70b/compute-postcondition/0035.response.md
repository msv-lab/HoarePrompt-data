Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `t` from user input, where `n` represents the number of bus routes. It then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` of each bus route. The function calculates the minimum time until the next bus departs based on the current time `t` and returns the 1-based index of the bus with the earliest departure. If there are no bus routes (i.e., `n` is 0), it will return -1 as the index. The function does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 100 or negative values for `s` and `d`, which may lead to unexpected behavior.**
