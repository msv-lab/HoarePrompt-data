Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `t`, where `n` represents the number of bus routes and `t` represents a time value. It then reads `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` representing the start time and duration of each bus route. The function calculates the minimum time it takes for a bus to arrive based on the formula `(t - s) % d` for each bus route and returns the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum time. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it will print `-1`. **
