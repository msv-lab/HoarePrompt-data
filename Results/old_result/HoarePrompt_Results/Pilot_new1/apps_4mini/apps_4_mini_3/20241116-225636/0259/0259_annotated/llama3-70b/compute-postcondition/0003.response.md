The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input, which are converted to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is between 1 and 100000, and `buses` is an empty list. However, the specific values of `s` and `d` are not known since they depend on the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` have been assigned integer values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` is an empty list, and `s`, `d` are input integers**
