The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This initialization does not change the values of `n`, `t`, or `bus_routes`, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `s_i` and `d_i`, both of which are between 1 and 100000; `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `s_i` and `d_i`, both of which are between 1 and 100000; `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity**.
