The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, where `i` is 2. Since `n` is greater than 2, it indicates that `i` is a valid index for `bus_routes`. The exact values of `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the contents of `bus_routes` at index 2, but they will be updated accordingly. The values of `n`, `wait_time`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions provided**.
