The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, which has been updated based on the conditions related to `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, while the other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is unchanged**
