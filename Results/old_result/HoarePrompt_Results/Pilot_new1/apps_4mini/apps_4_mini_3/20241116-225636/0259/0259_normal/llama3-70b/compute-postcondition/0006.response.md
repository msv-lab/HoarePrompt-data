The code `s, d = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts them into integers, assigning them to `s` and `d` respectively. The previous values of `s` and `d` are not known, as they are being assigned from the input. The variables `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now assigned input integer values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)], `_` is 1, and `s` and `d` are input integers**
