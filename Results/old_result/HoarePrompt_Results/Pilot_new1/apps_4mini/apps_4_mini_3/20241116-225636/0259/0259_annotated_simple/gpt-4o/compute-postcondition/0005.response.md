The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is the starting point of the first bus route and is greater than or equal to `t`, the result of `wait_time` will be non-negative. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `wait_time` is `s_i - t` (non-negative)**
