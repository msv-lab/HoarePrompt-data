The variable `buses` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `buses` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list**
