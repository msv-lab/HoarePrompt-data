The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The other variables such as `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is a positive integer less than `t`, `d_i` is a positive integer, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`; `wait_time` is 0.
