Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, and `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], with `s_i` less than `t`. If the difference (t - s_i) is divisible by d_i, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i, ensuring that `wait_time` is always a non-negative value.***
