The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the existing `buses` list. The initial state indicates that `buses` contains both the original and new tuples. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers that will be added as a new tuple to the list. The previous values of `n` and `t` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**
