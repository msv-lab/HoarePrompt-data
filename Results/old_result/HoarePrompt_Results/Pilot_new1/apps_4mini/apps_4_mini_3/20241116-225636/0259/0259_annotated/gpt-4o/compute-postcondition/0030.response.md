The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not depend on the previous values of any other variables, and since there are no conditions or calculations affecting `wait_time`, it simply takes the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is 0**
