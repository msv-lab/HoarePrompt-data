Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference (t - s_i) is not divisible by d_i.***
