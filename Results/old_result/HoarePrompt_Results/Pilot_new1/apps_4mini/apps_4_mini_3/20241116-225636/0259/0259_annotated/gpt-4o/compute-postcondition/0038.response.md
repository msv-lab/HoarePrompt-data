Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is in the range from 0 to n-1, `s_i` and `d_i` are the respective values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all `s_i` values are less than `t` and none of the conditions yield a valid `wait_time`, `min_wait_time` may remain positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1.**
