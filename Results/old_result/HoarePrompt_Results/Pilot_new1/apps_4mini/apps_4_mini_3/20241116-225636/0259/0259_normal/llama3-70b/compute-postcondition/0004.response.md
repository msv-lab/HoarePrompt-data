The line of code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The previous state of `buses` is an empty list, and the values of `s` and `d` are input integers. Therefore, after executing the code, `buses` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(s, d)`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)], `_` is 0**
