Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum calculated time from all buses where `time` is less than the previous `min_time`, and `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that produced this minimum time. If `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute and update `min_time` and `ans` based on the conditions specified.**
