The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is a positive integer less than `t`, and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, we can calculate `wait_time`. The exact value of `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, which are not provided. However, we know that `wait_time` will be a positive integer since `d_i` is a positive integer and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is less than `d_i`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculation of `wait_time` based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`wait_time` is a positive integer based on the calculation `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
