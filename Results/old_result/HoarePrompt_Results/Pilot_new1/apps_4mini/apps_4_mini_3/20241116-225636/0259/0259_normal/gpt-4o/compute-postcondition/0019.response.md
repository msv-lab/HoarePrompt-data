The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, which is a positive integer. The value of `t` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `wait_time` will be calculated as the difference between `s_i` and `t`. 

Since `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` are not directly modified by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. 

The output state will reflect the values of these variables and the calculated `wait_time`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1], `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
