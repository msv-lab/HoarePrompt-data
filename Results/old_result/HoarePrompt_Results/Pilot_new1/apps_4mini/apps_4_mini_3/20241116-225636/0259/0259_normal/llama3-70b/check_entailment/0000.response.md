To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find out which bus route Serval will take based on the time he arrives at the bus station and the schedule of the buses. Each bus route is characterized by its first arrival time and the interval between subsequent buses.

### Code Analysis:
The program reads the number of bus routes (`n`) and the time (`t`) that Serval arrives at the station. It then reads pairs of integers representing the first bus arrival time (`s_i`) and the interval between buses (`d_i`) for each route. The code attempts to find the bus route with the shortest waiting time after `t`.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `t`, and then stores each bus route's information in a list called `buses`.
2. **Waiting Time Calculation**: For each bus route, it calculates the waiting time using the formula `(t - s) % d`. However, this formula does not correctly account for the cases where `t` is less than `s`. If `t` is less than `s`, the waiting time should be `s - t` instead of using the modulo operation.
3. **Indexing**: The program keeps track of the index of the bus route with the minimum waiting time and prints this index at the end.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case where `t < s`**: If Serval arrives before the first bus of a route, the program should recognize that he will simply wait for that first bus, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.
2. **Multiple Buses Arriving at the Same Time**: The problem states that if multiple buses arrive at the same time, any of them can be printed. The logic correctly finds the first bus but does not handle the case where two buses arrive at the same time.
3. **No Buses**: The description mentions that if `n` is 0, it should print -1. However, the current code does not handle this case since it assumes `n` is always at least 1.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function prints the index of the bus with the shortest waiting time. However, it also mentions that if there are no buses, it should print -1, which is not handled in the code. Additionally, the hints imply that the calculation of waiting time is correct, but as identified, the current formula is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases due to the issues identified, particularly with how waiting time is calculated and the lack of handling for when `t` is less than `s`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
