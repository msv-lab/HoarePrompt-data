The code initializes an empty list `buses`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n` or `t`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `t`, along with the new state of `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
