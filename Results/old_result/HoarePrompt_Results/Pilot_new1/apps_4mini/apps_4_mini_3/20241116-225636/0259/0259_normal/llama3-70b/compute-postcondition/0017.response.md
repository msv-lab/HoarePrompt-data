Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in buses, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in buses, and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. Additionally, `time` is less than `min_time`.***
