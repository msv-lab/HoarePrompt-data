According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `n`, which is a positive integer. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The variable `buses` is an empty list, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself but may be used within the loop body.

Since the loop is set to iterate `n` times, there are no additional adjustments needed for `n`. The loop variable is indicated by `_`, which means it is not used in the loop body.

However, it's important to note that `buses` starts as an empty list, and if the loop body is intended to modify this list or depend on it in some way, that context is not provided. The state of `t` does not affect the execution of the loop either.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are minimal since `n` is already a valid positive integer. The loop will execute as expected.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list**
