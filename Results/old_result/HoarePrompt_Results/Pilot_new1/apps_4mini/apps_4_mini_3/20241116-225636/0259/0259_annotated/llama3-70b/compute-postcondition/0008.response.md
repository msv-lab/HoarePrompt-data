According to the code, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than the current iteration count, which is represented by `_`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not retain a value, we can infer that after the last iteration, `_` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the number of times the loop has executed so far.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 0 and 99. If the loop has executed once, then `n` must be at least 2 for it to execute again. Since `n` is only stated to be between 0 and 99, we can set the minimum value of `n` to be 2 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `t` and `buses` are not directly affected by the loop iteration count.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**
