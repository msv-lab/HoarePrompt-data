Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` is not updated. This ensures that `chosen_route` reflects the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time.***
