Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of input integers (s, d), where `s` and `d` are integers provided via input. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. If `n` is greater than 100, it is outside the defined constraints but the loop will still attempt to execute `n` times unless handled elsewhere in the program.**
