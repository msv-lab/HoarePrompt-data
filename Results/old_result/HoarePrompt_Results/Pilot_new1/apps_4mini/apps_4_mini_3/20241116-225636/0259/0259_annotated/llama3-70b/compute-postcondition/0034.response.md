The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `t`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100, and the parameter `t` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100000. Additionally, for each bus route, there are pairs of integers `s_i` and `d_i`, where both `s_i` and `d_i` are integers that must be between 1 and 100000. 

Since there is no specific output provided in the prompt, we can summarize the functionality based on the input parameters alone.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 1 and 100) and `t` (an integer between 1 and 100000), along with pairs of integers `s_i` and `d_i` (each between 1 and 100000) for each bus route.**
