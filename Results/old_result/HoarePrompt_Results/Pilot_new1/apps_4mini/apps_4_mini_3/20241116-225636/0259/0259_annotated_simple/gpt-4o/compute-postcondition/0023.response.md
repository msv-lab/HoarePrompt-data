Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity. If `s_i` (the start time of the bus route) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`, indicating the wait time until the bus departs. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. In the case where `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This covers all scenarios for the given conditions.***
