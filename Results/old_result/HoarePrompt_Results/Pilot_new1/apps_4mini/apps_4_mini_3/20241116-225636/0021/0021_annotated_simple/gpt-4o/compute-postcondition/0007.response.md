To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `min_pos` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the calculation of `dist4`. We need to assume that `min_pos` is defined elsewhere in the program context, as it is necessary for the calculation of `dist4`.

2. The value of `dist4` is assigned to be `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. This means we will calculate the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`.

3. The initial values provided state that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, and `dist3` are already defined based on the initial state.

Given that `dist4` depends on `min_pos`, we cannot specify its value without knowing `min_pos`. However, we can state that `dist4` is calculated based on the formula provided.

Therefore, the output state reflects the known values and the calculation of `dist4`:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`**.
