Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and `n` to the ends of the list (0 and `n-1`), and prints this maximum distance. The function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or if 1 or `n` are not present in the list, which could lead to a ValueError when calling `index()`. Additionally, it does not validate that the input list contains exactly `n` integers. **
