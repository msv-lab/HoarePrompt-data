The code prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` have been defined in the initial state based on the conditions provided. Therefore, the output will depend on the specific values of `max_dist` and `min_dist`.

Since `max_dist` is defined as the maximum of `(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1)` and `(n - 2)`, and `min_dist` is defined as the minimum of `(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1)` and `(n - 2)`, we can summarize the output based on these definitions.

Let’s denote:
- `d = abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`
- `max_dist = max(d, n - 2)`
- `min_dist = min(d, n - 2)`

The expression `n - 1 - min_dist` can be computed as follows:
- If `d < n - 2`, then `min_dist = d` and `n - 1 - min_dist = n - 1 - d`.
- If `d >= n - 2`, then `min_dist = n - 2` and `n - 1 - min_dist = 1`.

Thus, the output will depend on the specific values of `d`, `n`, and the results of the max function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_dist` is the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (`n` - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); and the result printed is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**.
