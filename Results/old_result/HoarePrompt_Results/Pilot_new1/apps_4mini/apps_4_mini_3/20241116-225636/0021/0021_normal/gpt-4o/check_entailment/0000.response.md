The provided program aims to find the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n after performing exactly one swap. 

### Initial Assessment of the Code:
1. The code correctly identifies the positions of the minimum and maximum elements using `a.index(1)` and `a.index(n)`.
2. It calculates the distance from both the minimum and maximum elements to both ends of the list (index 0 and index n-1).
3. The maximum distance is determined using the `max()` function on these calculated distances.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The code does not handle cases where the input list does not contain the minimum (1) or maximum (n) values. However, according to the problem description, the input will always be a permutation of integers from 1 to n, which guarantees that both 1 and n will be present.
- The code does not account for any specific edge cases related to the positions of 1 and n. For instance, if they are already at the ends of the array, the output should still be valid as per the problem description.

### Analysis of Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function calculates the maximum distance from the positions of integers 1 and n to either end of the list and prints this maximum distance. It also mentions that it does not handle cases where 1 or n are not present, which is irrelevant because the problem guarantees their presence.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly follows the problem description and handles the given examples appropriately. Since the problem guarantees that both 1 and n will always be present in the permutation, the code will work correctly for all valid inputs specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap in all valid cases as per the problem statement.
