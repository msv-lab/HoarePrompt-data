The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` are known, as `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`. The calculation for `dist4` will yield a specific result based on the current values of `n` and `min_pos`. Other variables `a`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, and `dist3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to max_pos; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to min_pos; `dist4` is equal to abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**
