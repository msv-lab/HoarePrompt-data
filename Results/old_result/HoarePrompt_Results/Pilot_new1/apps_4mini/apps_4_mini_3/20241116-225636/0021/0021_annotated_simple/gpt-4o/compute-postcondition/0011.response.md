Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list `a` and the boundaries of the list (the first and last positions). The function then prints this maximum distance. However, it does not handle cases where 1 or `n` might not be present in the list, which would raise a ValueError. **
