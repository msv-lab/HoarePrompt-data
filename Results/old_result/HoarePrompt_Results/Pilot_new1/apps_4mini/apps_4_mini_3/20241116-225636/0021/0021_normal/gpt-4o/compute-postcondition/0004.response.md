The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The value of `max_pos` is determined by the initial state, which specifies that `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`. 

Since `max_pos` is an index, it can take any integer value within the range of the list indices, which is from `0` to `n-1`. The `abs` function calculates the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`, which will simply be the value of `max_pos` itself, as it is always non-negative.

Thus, `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos`.

The other variables `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to max_pos.**
