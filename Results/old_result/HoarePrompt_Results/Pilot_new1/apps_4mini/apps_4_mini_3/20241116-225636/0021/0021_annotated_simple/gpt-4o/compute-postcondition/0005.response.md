The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The values of `n`, `max_pos`, and `dist1` are known, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The value of `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`. 

The calculation for `dist2` will depend on the specific values of `n` and `max_pos`. Since `n` is at least 2, the expression `n - 1` will be at least 1. The absolute difference will yield a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`**.
