The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The function's output is not explicitly stated in the provided information, but it can be inferred that the function processes these inputs based on the constraints and relationships given. 

Since there are no specific output conditions mentioned, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, we can only summarize the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive).**
