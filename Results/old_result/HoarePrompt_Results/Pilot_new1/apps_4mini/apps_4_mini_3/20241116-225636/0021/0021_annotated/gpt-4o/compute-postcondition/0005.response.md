The variable `dist2` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. 

1. The expression `n - 1` calculates the value just before `n`.
2. Then, `max_pos` is subtracted from this value.
3. Finally, the absolute value of the result is taken to ensure that `dist2` is non-negative.

Since `n` is within the specified range and `max_pos` is defined as the index of `n` in the list, we can conclude that `dist2` will be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables involved and the computed value of `dist2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
