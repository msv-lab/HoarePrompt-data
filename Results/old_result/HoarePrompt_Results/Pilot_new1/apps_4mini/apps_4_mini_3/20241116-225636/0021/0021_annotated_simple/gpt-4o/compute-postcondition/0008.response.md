Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.**
