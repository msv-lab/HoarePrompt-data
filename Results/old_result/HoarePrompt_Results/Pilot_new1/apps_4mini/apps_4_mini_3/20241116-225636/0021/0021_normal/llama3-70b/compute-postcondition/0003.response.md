The variable `posn` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the integer `n` within the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the index of `n` in `a` is determined. The values of `n`, `a`, and `pos1` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of the element 1 in the list a; `posn` is the index of the element n in the list a.**
