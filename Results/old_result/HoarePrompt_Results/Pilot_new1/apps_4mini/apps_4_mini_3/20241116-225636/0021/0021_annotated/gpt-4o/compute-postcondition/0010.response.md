The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. The function's output is not explicitly stated, so we cannot derive specific return values from the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers that conform to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n).**
