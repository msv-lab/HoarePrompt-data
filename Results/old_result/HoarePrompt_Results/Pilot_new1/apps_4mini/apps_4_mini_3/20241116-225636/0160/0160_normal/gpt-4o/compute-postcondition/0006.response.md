According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1. Since the loop continues while `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to the next integer value. 

Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it should be adjusted to `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. Additionally, we need to ensure that `x` remains unchanged, and it is still at least 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains `i` and `x // i`, `x` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1 and `i` is adjusted to `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration.**
