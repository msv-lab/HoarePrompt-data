The variable `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, where `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific value for `i`. The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The previous state of `divisors` is not provided, so we can only state that `i` is added to `divisors`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, and `i` is added to the set `divisors`.**
