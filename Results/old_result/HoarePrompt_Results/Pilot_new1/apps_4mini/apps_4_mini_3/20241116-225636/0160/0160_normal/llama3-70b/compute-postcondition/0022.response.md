Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged. In all cases, `max_divisor` is either its original value or updated based on the division of `gcd` by `i`.***
