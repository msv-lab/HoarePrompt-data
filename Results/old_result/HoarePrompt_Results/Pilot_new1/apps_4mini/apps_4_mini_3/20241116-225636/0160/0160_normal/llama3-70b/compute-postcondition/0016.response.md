The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Given that `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `i` is 1, the calculation becomes `gcd // 1`, which is equal to `gcd`. Therefore, `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)` will be `max(gcd, gcd)`, which remains `gcd`. The value of `max_divisor` does not change. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd**.
