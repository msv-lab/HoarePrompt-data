Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` now contains `i`, `x` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, and `divisors` is updated to include `x // i`.**
