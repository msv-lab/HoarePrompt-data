Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is either `gcd` (if `gcd` > 2) or 2 (if `gcd` â‰¤ 2). If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. If `gcd` is 2, `max_divisor` remains 2. If `gcd` is greater than 2 and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` could potentially be updated to a value derived from `gcd // 2`, depending on its initial value.***
