Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, and `divisors` is a set. If `x` is at least 1 and `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, and if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged.***
