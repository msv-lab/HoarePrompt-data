Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `gcd` is greater than 2 and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is 2, `max_divisor` remains 2. Thus, `max_divisor` will either be `gcd`, 2, or potentially a value derived from `gcd // i`, depending on the conditions met.***
