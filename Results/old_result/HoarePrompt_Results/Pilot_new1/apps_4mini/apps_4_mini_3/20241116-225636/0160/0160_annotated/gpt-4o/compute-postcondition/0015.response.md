Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` found in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is at least 1, the loop will execute for each integer `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For each `i`, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by any `i` in that range, `divisors` will still contain any previously added divisors but will not change for that iteration.**
