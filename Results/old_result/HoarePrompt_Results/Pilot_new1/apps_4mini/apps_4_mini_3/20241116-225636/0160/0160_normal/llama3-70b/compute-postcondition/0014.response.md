The code updates the value of `max_divisor` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Given that `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1, we compare `max_divisor` (which is `gcd`) with `i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max(max_divisor, i)` will return `gcd`. Therefore, the value of `max_divisor` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
