The variable `A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into components. The input will provide a series of integers which will fill the list `A`. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `A` based on the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer from input, `K` is a non-negative integer from input, and `A` is a list of N integers from input**
