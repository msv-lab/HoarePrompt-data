`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` (which is greater than 4) and `i` (which is 3). Since `max_divisor` is greater than 4, it will remain unchanged after the operation. The value of `i` does not affect the outcome since it is less than `max_divisor`. Therefore, the output state is: `max_divisor` is greater than 4, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is greater than 4, `i` is 3**
