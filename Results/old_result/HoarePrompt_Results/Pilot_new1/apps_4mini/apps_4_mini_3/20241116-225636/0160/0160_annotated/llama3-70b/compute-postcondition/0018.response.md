Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
