The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Given that `gcd` is at least 9 and `i` is 3, `gcd // i` will be at least `9 // 3`, which equals 3. Therefore, `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)` will compare the current value of `max_divisor` (which is at least 9) with 3. Since `max_divisor` is at least 9, it will remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 3, `max_divisor` is at least 9 and remains the same.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 3, `max_divisor` is at least 9 and remains the same**
