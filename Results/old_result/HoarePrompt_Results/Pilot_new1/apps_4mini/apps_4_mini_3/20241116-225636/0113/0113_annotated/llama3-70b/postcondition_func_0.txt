The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input, calculates `10^k`, and increments `n` until it becomes divisible by `10^k`. It then prints the resulting value of `n`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original `n` that is divisible by `10^k`. If `n` is already divisible by `10^k`, it remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but prints the result instead.
