The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is an input positive integer, so after execution, `n` will be `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
