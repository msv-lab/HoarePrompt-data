The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is an input positive integer that was previously incremented by 1, the new value of `n` will be greater than its previous value. The condition `n % x != 0` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the increment operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, and now `n` is incremented by 1 again.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, and now `n` is incremented by 1 again**
