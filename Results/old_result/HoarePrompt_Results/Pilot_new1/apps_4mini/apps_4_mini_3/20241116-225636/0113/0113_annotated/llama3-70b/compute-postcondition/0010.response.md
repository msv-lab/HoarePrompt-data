The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the constraints provided, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8. However, since the function does not take any parameters, it does not utilize these constraints directly in its definition. 

As there is no output specified in the provided details, we cannot determine the return value of the function. Therefore, we cannot describe its functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
