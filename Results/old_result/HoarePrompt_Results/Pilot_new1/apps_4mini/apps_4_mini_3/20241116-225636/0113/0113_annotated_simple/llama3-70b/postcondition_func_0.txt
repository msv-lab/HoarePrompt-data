The function accepts two integer inputs, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 10^9) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 8). It increments `n` until it becomes divisible by `10^k`, and then prints the resulting value of `n`. If `n` is already divisible by `10^k`, it remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but outputs the modified `n`.
