The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is an input positive integer that has already been incremented by 1, it will now be increased by 1 again. The previous value of `n` is not specified beyond being a positive integer that is not a multiple of 10, but we can denote the new value of `n` as `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer incremented by 2, `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10**
