To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

### Problem Description
The program needs to compute the k-rounding of a positive integer `n`, which is defined as the smallest positive integer `x` such that:
1. `x` is divisible by `n`
2. `x` ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10.

### Provided Code
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    # The program returns the value of x, which is calculated as n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
```

### Code Analysis
1. **Multiplier Calculation**: 
   - `multiplier = 10 ** k` correctly computes the value that represents the minimum number that ends with `k` zeros. For example, if `k = 4`, then `multiplier` will be `10000`.

2. **GCD Calculation**: 
   - `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` computes the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. This is necessary to ensure that the product `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` is divisible by `n` and also to find the least multiple of `n` that meets the zero-ending requirement.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))` effectively computes the smallest integer that is both divisible by `n` and has at least `k` trailing zeros. The division by the GCD ensures that we are scaling `n` up to the nearest multiple of `multiplier`.

### Example Cases
1. **Case 1**: `n = 375`, `k = 4`
   - `multiplier = 10000`
   - `gcd(375, 10000) = 125`
   - `x = 375 * (10000 // 125) = 375 * 80 = 30000` (Correct)
   
2. **Case 2**: `n = 10000`, `k = 1`
   - `multiplier = 10`
   - `gcd(10000, 10) = 10`
   - `x = 10000 * (10 // 10) = 10000 * 1 = 10000` (Correct)

3. **Case 3**: `n = 38101`, `k = 0`
   - `multiplier = 1`
   - `gcd(38101, 1) = 1`
   - `x = 38101 * (1 // 1) = 38101` (Correct)

4. **Case 4**: `n = 123456789`, `k = 8`
   - `multiplier = 100000000`
   - `gcd(123456789, 100000000) = 1`
   - `x = 123456789 * (100000000 // 1) = 12345678900000000` (Correct)

### Edge Cases
- **Minimum Values**: For `n = 1`, `k = 0`, the output should be `1`, which is handled correctly.
- **Maximum Values**: For `n = 10^9`, `k = 8`, it should return `10^9 * 10^8 = 10^17`, which is also handled correctly.

### Conclusion
The program handles all specified cases and edge cases correctly according to the problem description. There are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
