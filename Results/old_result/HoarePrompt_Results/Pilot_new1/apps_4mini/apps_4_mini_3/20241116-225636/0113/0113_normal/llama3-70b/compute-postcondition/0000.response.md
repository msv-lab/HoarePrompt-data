The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided. The program uses `map(int, input().split())` to read a line of input, split it into two parts, and convert those parts into integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten with the new input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8**
