The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the value of `x` computed as `n` multiplied by the quotient of `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. The actual calculation uses `10` instead of `10
