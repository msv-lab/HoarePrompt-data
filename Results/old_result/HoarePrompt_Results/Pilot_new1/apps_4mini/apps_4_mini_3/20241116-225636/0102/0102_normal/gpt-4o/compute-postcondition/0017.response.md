Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string representation from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, and `n` is a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, it returns a string in the format 'tens' + '-' + 'ones', where 'tens' is the string representation of the tens place of `n`, and 'ones' is the string representation of the units place of `n`. This encompasses all valid cases for `n`, including edge cases at 10 and 99, ensuring accurate string representation for all specified values.***
