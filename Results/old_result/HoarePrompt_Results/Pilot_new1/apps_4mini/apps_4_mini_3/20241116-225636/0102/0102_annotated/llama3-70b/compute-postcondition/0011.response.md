Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the corresponding string from the `teens` list is printed. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output will be the string representation of `s` in words, combining the appropriate string from the `tens` list and the `ones` list as needed, with a hyphen if there is a non-zero value in the ones place.***
