The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English word representation for numbers between 0 and 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 and a multiple of 10, it returns the word for the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation in the format 'tens' + '-' + 'ones'. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, leading to unspecified behavior for those values.
