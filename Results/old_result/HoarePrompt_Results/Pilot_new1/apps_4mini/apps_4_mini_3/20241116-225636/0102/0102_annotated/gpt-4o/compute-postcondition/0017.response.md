Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99, and `s` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `s` in the format 'tens' + '-' + 'ones'. Values of `s` that are less than 0 or greater than 99 are not handled, leading to unspecified behavior for those cases.***
