The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided, which is taken as a space-separated string and converted to integers. The constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning that `y` must be at least 3 and less than `x`, while `x` must be greater than or equal to `y` and at most 100,000. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not known, so the output state reflects that they are now assigned values based on the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
