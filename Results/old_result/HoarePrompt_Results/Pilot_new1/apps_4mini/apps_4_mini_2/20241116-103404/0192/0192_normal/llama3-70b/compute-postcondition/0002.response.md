The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function does not specify any output in the provided description. Therefore, without additional information on the return values or behavior of the function based on these parameters, we cannot determine a specific functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers constrained by the conditions \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
