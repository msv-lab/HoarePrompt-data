Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where both numbers are zero correctly. Specifically, when both `a` and `b` are "0", the program will output "=" as expected. However, if both numbers have leading zeroes (e.g., "0000"), the program will strip the leading zeroes and still treat them as equal, which is correct. 

The issue arises when both inputs are empty strings after stripping leading zeroes (which could happen if the input is just a line of leading zeroes). The program does handle this by checking if `a` or `b` is empty after stripping leading zeroes and assigns them to '0', but this logic is not explicitly tested in the provided cases.

A potential edge case that could be problematic is if the input is not guaranteed to be formatted correctly (e.g., if there are unexpected characters or whitespace). The program assumes the input will always be two valid non-negative integers. If an input case were to contain invalid characters or formatting (like extra spaces or non-numeric characters), the program would fail, which is not covered in the problem description.

Since the problem description does not mention that the input will always be valid, the program may not work as expected in all cases, leading to incorrect output for invalid inputs. Thus, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.
