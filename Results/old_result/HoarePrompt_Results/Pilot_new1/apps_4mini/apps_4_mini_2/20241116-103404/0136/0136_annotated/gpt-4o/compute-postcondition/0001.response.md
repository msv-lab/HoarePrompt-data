The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros stripped off using the `lstrip('0')` method. The value of `data[0]` is a string representing a non-negative integer, so after executing this line, `a` will hold the string representation of that integer without any leading zeros. The value of `b` and the structure of `data` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers; `a` is the string of the first integer without leading zeros; `b` remains unchanged.**
