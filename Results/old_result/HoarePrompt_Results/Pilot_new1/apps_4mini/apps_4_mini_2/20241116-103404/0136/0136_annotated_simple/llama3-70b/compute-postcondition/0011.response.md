The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have up to 10^6 digits. The function is designed to process these inputs and return a result based on their values. However, since the specific output behavior is not provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the return value.
