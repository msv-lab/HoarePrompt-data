To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and its annotations thoroughly.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to compare two non-negative integers `a` and `b`.
2. The integers may contain leading zeroes and can be very long (up to 10^6 digits).
3. The output should be:
   - `<` if `a < b`
   - `>` if `a > b`
   - `=` if `a == b`
4. If either integer is empty, it should be treated as `0`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads input and splits it into two parts, `a` and `b`.
   - It uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both integers.
   - If `a` or `b` becomes empty after stripping leading zeros, they are set to `'0'`.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. 
   - If `len(a) < len(b)`, it prints `<`.
   - If `len(a) > len(b)`, it prints `>`.
   - If the lengths are equal, it compares the values of `a` and `b` lexicographically:
     - It prints `<` if `a < b`, `>` if `a > b`, and `=` if they are equal.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The annotations mention that if either `a` or `b` is an empty string, it is treated as `0`, which aligns with the problem description.
- The comparison logic correctly handles integers with leading zeros after they have been stripped.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations provide a detailed explanation of the program's behavior and confirm that it handles various scenarios correctly. They also reiterate the handling of empty strings, which is crucial for the correctness of the program.

### Potential Issues:
Upon reviewing the code and annotations, there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that the code does not handle. The program appears to correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly handles all specified conditions and edge cases, I conclude that it adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately compares two non-negative integers, handles leading zeros, treats empty inputs as `0`, and produces the expected output for all specified cases.
