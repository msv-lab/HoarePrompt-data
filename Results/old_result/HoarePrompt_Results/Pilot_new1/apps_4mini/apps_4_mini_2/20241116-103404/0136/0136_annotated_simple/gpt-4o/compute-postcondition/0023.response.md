Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `a` is either '0' or retains its original value, `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, and `data` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. The conditions ensure that both `a` and `b` have the same length, preventing any edge cases related to leading zeros or negative values, thus maintaining the integrity of the comparisons.***
