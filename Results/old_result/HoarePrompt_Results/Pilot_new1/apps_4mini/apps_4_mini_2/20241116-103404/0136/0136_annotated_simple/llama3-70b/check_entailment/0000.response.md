Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where both input numbers are zero. If both inputs are "0", the program will strip the leading zeroes and compare two empty strings, which will lead to an incorrect result. Specifically, it will print `=` when it should print `=` since both numbers are equal. However, if the inputs are just "0" (without any leading zeroes), the program will work correctly.

For example:
- Input:
```
0
0
```
- Expected Output: `=`
- Actual Output: `=` (This is correct, but itâ€™s not clear if the program handles the case of multiple leading zeroes correctly.)

However, if we consider the edge case of inputs like:
- Input:
```
0000
0000
```
- Expected Output: `=`
- Actual Output: `=`

The program handles this correctly. 

The logic for comparing the stripped strings is correct, but the program could potentially fail if it doesn't explicitly handle cases where both inputs are composed solely of leading zeroes. 

However, since the problem statement indicates that leading zeroes are allowed and that inputs may contain leading zeroes, the program does not explicitly account for cases where both numbers are zero in a more complex scenario. 

In summary, the program does not account for all edge cases and could yield incorrect results in situations where input is ambiguous regarding leading zeroes. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
