Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where both inputs are `0`. For example, if the input is:
```
0
0
```
The expected output should be `=` since both numbers are equal. However, the program will strip leading zeros and compare empty strings, which will not yield the correct result. Therefore, the program fails to handle this edge case correctly.
