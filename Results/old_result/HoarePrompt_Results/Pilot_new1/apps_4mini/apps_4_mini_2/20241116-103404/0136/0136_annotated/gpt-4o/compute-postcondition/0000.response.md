The code takes input from the user, which is expected to be a string containing two non-negative integers separated by spaces. The `split()` method will divide this string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, after executing the code, `data` will contain these two strings.

The previous state of `a` and `b` is not impacted directly by this line of code, but the output state will include the `data` variable holding the split values.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers, `a` and `b`.**
