Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros, and `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros (if initially empty, `b` is set to '0'). The function prints '<' if the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, '>' if the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b` when their lengths are equal, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, or '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. All edge cases are covered, including when `b` is initially empty.***
