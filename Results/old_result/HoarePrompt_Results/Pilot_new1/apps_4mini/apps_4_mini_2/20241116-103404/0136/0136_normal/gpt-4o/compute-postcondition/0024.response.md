Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros and remains unchanged if it was not empty; `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and if `b` was initially empty, it is set to '0'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the output is '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, or '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. This ensures all cases are handled, including when `b` is initially empty.***
