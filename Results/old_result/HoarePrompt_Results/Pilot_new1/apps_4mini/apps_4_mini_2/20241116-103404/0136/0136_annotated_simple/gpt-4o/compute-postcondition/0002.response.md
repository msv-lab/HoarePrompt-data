The code assigns to `b` the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros stripped off using `lstrip('0')`. The initial state specifies that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. The value of `data[1]` is not provided, but it will be processed to remove any leading zeros.

If `data[1]` is an empty string or consists entirely of zeros, `b` will become an empty string. If `data[1]` contains digits, `b` will contain those digits without any leading zeros.

Therefore, the output state reflects the potential new value of `b` based on `data[1]`. 

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the integer without leading zeros; `b` is the string representation of the non-negative integer after stripping leading zeros; `data` is a list of input strings split by whitespace.**
