Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. The length of string `a` is less than or equal to the length of string `b`. If `b` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. The first string `a` remains unchanged or is set to '0' if it was originally empty, and both strings retain their values without leading zeros. If `b` was originally a non-empty string, it remains unchanged without leading zeros.***
