The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, and they satisfy the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, it returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return their greatest common divisor. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.**
