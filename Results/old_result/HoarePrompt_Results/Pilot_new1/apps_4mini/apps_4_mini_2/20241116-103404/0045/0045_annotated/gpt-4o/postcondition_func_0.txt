The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum required sum as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it computes a sequence of `k` integers that sum up to `n`, with the first element being `d` times 1, the second being `d` times 2, and so on, where `d` is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. If there is a remainder after this division, it increments the last elements of the sequence to account for the remainder. The function returns this sequence, which will have the first `k` integers that add up to `n`. If the remainder is greater than zero, the last elements of the sequence are incremented accordingly. If there is an issue with the logic, such as the sequence being incremented beyond the intended values, it is not handled in the code.
