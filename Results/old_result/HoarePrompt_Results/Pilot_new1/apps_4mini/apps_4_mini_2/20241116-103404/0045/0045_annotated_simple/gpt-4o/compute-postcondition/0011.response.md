The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `sequence[i]`, but it indicates that `sequence` is an array or list where the index `i` is valid. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.
