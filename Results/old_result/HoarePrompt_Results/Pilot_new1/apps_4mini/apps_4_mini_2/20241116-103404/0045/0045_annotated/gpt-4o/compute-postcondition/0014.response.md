The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
