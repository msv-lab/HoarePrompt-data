Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is equal to `0`. If `remainder` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the sequence can be evenly divided without any leftover. This means that the `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]` and `i` is equal to `k - 1`.***
