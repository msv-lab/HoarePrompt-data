To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. We know that `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. The function checks if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. If it is, the function returns -1. If not, the function continues without returning any value.
3. The code snippet provided is `d = n // min_sum`, which means `d` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `min_sum` using integer division.

Since the initial state indicates that `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, we proceed to calculate `d`.

- `d` will be the result of `n // min_sum`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, and the calculated value of `d`. However, the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, so we can only describe `d` in relation to `n` and `min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is `n // min_sum`**.
