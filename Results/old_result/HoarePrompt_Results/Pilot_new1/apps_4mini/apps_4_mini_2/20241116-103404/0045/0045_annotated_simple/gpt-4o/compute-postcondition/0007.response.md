According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means `i` will take values starting from `k - 1` and decrementing until it reaches `0`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1`, since if `k` is `0`, the loop will not execute at all. 

Additionally, since `i` starts at `k - 1`, we can state that `i` will be `k - 1` at the beginning of the loop. 

The variables `n`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they might be relevant for the loop body. However, since the task is only to adjust the states necessary for the loop to execute, we focus on `k` and `i`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least `1`, and `i` is initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of the first k multiples of d, `i` is `k - 1`**
