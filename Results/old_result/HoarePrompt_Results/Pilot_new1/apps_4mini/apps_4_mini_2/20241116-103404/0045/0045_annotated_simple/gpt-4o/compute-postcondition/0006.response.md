The code creates a list called `sequence` using a list comprehension. The variable `d` is defined as `n // min_sum`, which represents how many complete sets of the first `k` positive integers can fit into `n`. The list comprehension iterates over a range of `k`, where `i` takes values from `0` to `k-1`. For each `i`, it computes `d * (i + 1)`, which generates the first `k` multiples of `d`. 

Since `d` is derived from the initial state and the values of `n`, `min_sum`, and `k` are defined, the output state reflects the values of `sequence` as well as the other variables.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of the first k multiples of d.**
