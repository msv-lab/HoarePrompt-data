The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. Initially, `remainder` is -1, so after execution, `remainder` becomes -2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (where `i` is `k - 2`).
