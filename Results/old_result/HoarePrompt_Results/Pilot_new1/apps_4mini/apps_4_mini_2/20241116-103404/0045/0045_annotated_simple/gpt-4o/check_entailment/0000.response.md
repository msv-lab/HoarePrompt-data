To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The program aims to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that their sum equals `n` and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. If no such sequence exists, the program should return `-1`.

### Code Breakdown
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
   if (min_sum > n):
       return -1
   ```
   - `min_sum` calculates the smallest sum of the first `k` positive integers (1, 2, ..., k).
   - If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to form such a sequence.

2. **Calculating the Sequence**:
   ```python
   d = n // min_sum
   remainder = n - d * min_sum
   sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
   ```
   - `d` determines how many times the minimum sequence can be multiplied to fit within `n`.
   - `remainder` calculates how much more is needed to reach `n` after forming the base sequence.
   - `sequence` initially is the sequence of the first `k` integers multiplied by `d`.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
       if remainder == 0:
           break
       
       sequence[i] += 1
       remainder -= 1
   ```
   - This loop attempts to distribute the `remainder` among the last elements of the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
1. **Case When `n` is Less Than `min_sum`**:
   - The program correctly returns `-1` if `n` is less than the minimum sum required for `k` numbers.
   
2. **Sequence Generation Logic**:
   - The logic for generating the sequence seems to work under the assumption that distributing the `remainder` will still maintain the strictly increasing property. However, there's a potential issue.
   - If `d` is `0` (which can happen if `n` is less than `min_sum`), the sequence will not be valid since it will contain zeros, which are not positive integers.

3. **GCD Maximization**:
   - The program does not explicitly check or ensure that the GCD of the generated sequence is maximized. It simply constructs a sequence based on the division of `n` by `min_sum` and then adjusts it with the `remainder`. This does not guarantee that the GCD is maximized, as there could be cases where a different distribution of the integers could yield a higher GCD.

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee that the GCD of the sequence is maximized, and it also does not handle the case where `d` could potentially lead to invalid sequences. 

Given that there are potential inputs where the program may not produce the correct output, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
