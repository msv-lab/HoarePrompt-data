According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `k - 2`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `k - 2`, and since `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, it will refer to the updated value of `sequence[k - 2]` after the increment.

The other states, such as `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder`, do not need to be adjusted since they are not directly affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (where `i` is `k - 2`)**
