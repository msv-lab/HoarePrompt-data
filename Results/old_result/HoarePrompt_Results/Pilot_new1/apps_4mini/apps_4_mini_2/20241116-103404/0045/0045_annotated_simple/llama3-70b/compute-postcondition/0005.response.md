According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and since `a` is not a multiple of `b`, `a % b` is guaranteed to be a positive integer. Therefore, `b` will be non-zero after the last iteration, which means the loop can execute again without any adjustments needed.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10; `a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `a` is not a multiple of `b`.**
