According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 3`. Additionally, since `i` is iterating from `k - 1` down to `0`, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 for `i` to be `k - 3` and still be valid (i.e., non-negative).

Given that `k` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 3. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 3, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the element at index `k - 2` incremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 3`**
