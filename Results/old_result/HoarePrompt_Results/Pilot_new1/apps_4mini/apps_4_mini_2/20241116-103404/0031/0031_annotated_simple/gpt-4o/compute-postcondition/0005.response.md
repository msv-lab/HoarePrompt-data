The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Since `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), we need to check if `k` is greater than \(2^n\).

If \(k > 2^n\), the program would print (1, 1) and return, but since we are only executing the line that assigns a value to `total_days`, we will calculate that value.

Therefore, `total_days` will be \(2^n\). The output state will reflect the computed value of `total_days` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n**
