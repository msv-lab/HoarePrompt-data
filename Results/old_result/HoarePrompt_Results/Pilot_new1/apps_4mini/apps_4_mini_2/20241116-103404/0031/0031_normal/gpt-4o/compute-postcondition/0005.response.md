The value of `total_days` is assigned the value `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). Since `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `total_days` will be a power of 2 ranging from 2 to \(2^{10^{18}}\). The variable `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `total_days` while keeping `n` and `k` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is \(2^n\)**
