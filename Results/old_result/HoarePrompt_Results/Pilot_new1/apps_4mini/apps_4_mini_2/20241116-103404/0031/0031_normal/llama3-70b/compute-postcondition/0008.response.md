The variable `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is `2` raised to the power of `n`, which means `total_days = 2^n`. Since `denominator` was not provided in the initial state, we assume it holds some value before this operation. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the multiplication of `denominator` by `total_days`, while keeping `n` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`; `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`.**
