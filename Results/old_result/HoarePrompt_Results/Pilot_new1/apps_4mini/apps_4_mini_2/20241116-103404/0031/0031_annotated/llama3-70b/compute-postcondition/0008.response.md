The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, the new value of `denominator` will be `denominator * total_days`, which is `denominator * (2^n)`. The previous value of `denominator` is `2^n`, so the updated value becomes `(2^n) * (2^n)`, which simplifies to `2^(2n)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n; `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1); `denominator` is 2^(2n); `k` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 1**
