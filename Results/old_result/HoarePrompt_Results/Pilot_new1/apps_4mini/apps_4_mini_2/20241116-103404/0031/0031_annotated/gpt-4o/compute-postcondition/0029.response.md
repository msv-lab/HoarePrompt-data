Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`. It prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function calculates a numerator and a denominator based on `k` and `n`, but does not return or print any output in this case. The function does not handle the scenario where `k` is 0 or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The final output is only produced if `k` exceeds \(2^n\).**
