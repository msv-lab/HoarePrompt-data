According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value for the current iteration, which is `i = k - 1`. Since `k` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `k`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be set to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `total_days` and `denominator` are not affected by the loop's execution count, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`; `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`; `i` is k**
