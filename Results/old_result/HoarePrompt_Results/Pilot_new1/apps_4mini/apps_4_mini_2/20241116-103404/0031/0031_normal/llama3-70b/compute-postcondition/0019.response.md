Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It calculates the total number of days as `2 ** n`, then computes the numerator as the product of `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)` and the denominator as `total_days` raised to the power of `k`. It then reduces the fraction formed by the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) and returns both values after applying modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If `k` is greater than `total_days`, the numerator may include negative values, which is not handled in the function, potentially leading to unexpected results.**
