To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code.

The problem requires calculating the probability that at least two people out of `k` interviewed have the same birthday among `2^n` possible days. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime, and both should be printed modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Key Points of the Code:
1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The function `func_1` calculates the GCD to help reduce the fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).
2. **Handling Cases**:
   - If `k > 2^n`, it immediately returns \( \frac{1}{1} \) because it is guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday.
   - It calculates the total number of days as \( 2^n \) and then computes the probability of no shared birthdays using a loop.
3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - It calculates the numerator as the product of available days for each person interviewed, and the denominator as the total number of days raised to the power of `k`.
   - Finally, it computes the shared birthday probability and reduces the fraction.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Large Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - The program uses bitwise operations (like `1 << n`) to compute \( 2^n \). For very large `n`, this can lead to extremely large numbers that may not be handled properly in Python, but Python's integers can grow as needed.
   - However, if `k` is much larger than \( 2^n \), the program correctly identifies this and outputs \( \frac{1}{1} \).

2. **Special Case of `k = 1`**:
   - The problem states \( 2 \leq k \), so this case is not applicable. However, if it were included, it would need to return \( \frac{0}{1} \) since one person cannot share a birthday.

3. **Reducing the Fraction**:
   - The reduction of \( A \) and \( B \) using GCD is crucial. The code correctly reduces the values before taking them modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Conclusion:
The program seems to cover the necessary cases and correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the constraints provided.

Therefore, the final determination of correctness is:

Correctness: **True**.
