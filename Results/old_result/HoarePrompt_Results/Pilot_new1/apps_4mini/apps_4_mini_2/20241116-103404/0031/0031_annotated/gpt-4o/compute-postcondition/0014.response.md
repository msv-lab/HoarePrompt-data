According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `k` must be at least 2 to ensure that the loop can run again.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be 2.
- `k` should be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \((2^n \mod 1000003) * ((2^n) - 1) \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \((2^{2n}) \mod 1000003\), `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 1**
