To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days.
- The result should be expressed as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).
- We need to ensure that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime before taking their modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Code Analysis
The code provided is as follows:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
(A, B) = func_1(n, k)
print(A, B)

def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        denominator *= total_days
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return (numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3))
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `total_days` is calculated as \( 2^n \).
   - `numerator` starts at 1 and is multiplied by \( total\_days - i \) for each person \( i \).
   - `denominator` is simply \( total\_days \) raised to the power of \( k \).

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the GCD of `numerator` and `denominator` to reduce the fraction.

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns the reduced `numerator` and `denominator` modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **When `k > total_days`**:
   - If \( k \) exceeds \( 2^n \), then it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday. The probability should be \( \frac{1}{1} \).
   - The current implementation does not handle this case explicitly; it would still compute a fraction based on the loop, which may lead to incorrect results.

2. **Very Large Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - Given the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \), the calculations involving \( 2^n \) and the resulting products could lead to very large numbers, potentially causing overflow or performance issues.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is performed after reducing the fraction. It is essential that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime before taking modulo, which the code attempts to do. However, it does not explicitly check for the case where \( k > total_days \).

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints suggest that the function calculates the total number of days and the probability correctly. However, they do not address the edge case of \( k > total_days \), which is critical for correctness.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where \( k \) exceeds \( 2^n \) correctly, which is a significant oversight. This means that the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for the situation where \( k > 2^n \), which should return \( 1 \) and \( 1 \) instead of calculating a fraction based on the loop.
