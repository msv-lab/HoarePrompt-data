The code executes a print statement that outputs the values `1` and `1`. The initial state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` is not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the values printed and the unchanged state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the function prints 1, 1**
