According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\), it ensures that the loop will execute at least twice. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `k - 1`. Since `n` is between 1 and \(10^{18}\), it does not directly affect the execution of the loop but is relevant for understanding the context of `total_days`. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute, `i` needs to start at 0, and `k` must be at least 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
