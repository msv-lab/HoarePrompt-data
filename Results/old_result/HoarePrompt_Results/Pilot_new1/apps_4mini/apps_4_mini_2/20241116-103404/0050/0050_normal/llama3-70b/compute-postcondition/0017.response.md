Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `shares` is updated to the total number of shares calculated from `r` divided by `s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks, leaving `shares` unchanged at 0, and `r` remains the same as it was before the check.***
