The variable `s` is assigned a list created from the input values converted to integers. The values for `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The output state will reflect the new variable `s` containing the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from input.**
