Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from the input; `s` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`; `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`; `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`; the function prints `total_bourles`.**
