The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `shares` is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
