The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from the user, which is split into separate strings. This means `b` will now hold a list of integers based on the user input. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged, but `b` will now contain the integers provided as input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers within the ranges 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of n positive integers; `b` is a list of m integers based on user input**
