The variable `b` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged, but `b` now holds a list of integers from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from the input; `s` is a list of integers from the input; `b` is a list of integers from the input.**
