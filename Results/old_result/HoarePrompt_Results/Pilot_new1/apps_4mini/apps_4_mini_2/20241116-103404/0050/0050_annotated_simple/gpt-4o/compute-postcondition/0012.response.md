Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers within the ranges 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of `n` positive integers; `b` is a list of `m` integers based on user input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, which is then printed. This covers all scenarios including when `max_sell_price` equals `min_buy_price`, ensuring the function handles both cases appropriately.***
