According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is `k + 1`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the values of `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `k + 2`, and we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `k + 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` is greater than `k + 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than `k + 2`, `i` is `k + 1`**
