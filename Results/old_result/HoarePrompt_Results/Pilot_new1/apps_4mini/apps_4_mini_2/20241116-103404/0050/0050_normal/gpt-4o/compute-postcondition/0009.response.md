The code calculates `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, and `max_shares` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the current values of these variables along with the newly calculated `remaining_bourles`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from the input; `s` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`; `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.**
