Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of integers from input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from input in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks, leaving `shares` unchanged at 0, and `r`, `s`, and `b` remain in their initial states. In either case, `i` remains 0.***
