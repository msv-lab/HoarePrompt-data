According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted as `shares`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is at least `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is a sorted list.**
