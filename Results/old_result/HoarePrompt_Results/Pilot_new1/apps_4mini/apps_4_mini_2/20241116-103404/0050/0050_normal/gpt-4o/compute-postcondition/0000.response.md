The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input, which are integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown since they depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now assigned values from the input, while the states of the lists `s` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from the input; `s` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers**
