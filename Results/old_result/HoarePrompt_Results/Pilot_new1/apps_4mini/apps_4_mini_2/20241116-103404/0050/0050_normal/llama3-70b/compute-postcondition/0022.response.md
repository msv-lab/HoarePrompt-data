Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 30. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding `r // s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, ensuring `r` remains less than `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop is exited without modifying `shares` or `r`.***
