The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `shares` is updated to the total number of shares calculated from `r` divided by `s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
