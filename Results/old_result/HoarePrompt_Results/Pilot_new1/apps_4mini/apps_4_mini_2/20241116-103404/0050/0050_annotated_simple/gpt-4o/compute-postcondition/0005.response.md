Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers within the ranges 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of `n` positive integers; `b` is a list of `m` integers based on user input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from `b`; `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`.***
