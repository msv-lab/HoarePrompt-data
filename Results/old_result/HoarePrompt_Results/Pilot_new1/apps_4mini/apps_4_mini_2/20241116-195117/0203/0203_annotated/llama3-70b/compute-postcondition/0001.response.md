The value of `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is only used to define the length of the string. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' from the input**
