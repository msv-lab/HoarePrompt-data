The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The initial state does not provide any information about the previous values of `r_queue`, but it is assumed to be a list that can hold values. The value of `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `1` is added to `r_queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character of `votes`; and `1` is appended to `r_queue`.
