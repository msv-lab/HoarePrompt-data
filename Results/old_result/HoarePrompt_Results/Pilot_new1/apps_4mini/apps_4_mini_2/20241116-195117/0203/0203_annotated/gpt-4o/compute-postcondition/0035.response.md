The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The value of `r_queue` is unchanged prior to this operation, but after executing `pop(0)`, the first element is removed from `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` will be the value of the first element that was in `r_queue` before the operation. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` is one element less than before, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`**.
