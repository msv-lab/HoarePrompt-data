The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to the end of `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is known, and `n` is defined but not specified in the initial state. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `r_queue` after the append operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element (now one less), `r_queue` is updated with `r_index + n`, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the element removed from the front of `r_queue`.**
