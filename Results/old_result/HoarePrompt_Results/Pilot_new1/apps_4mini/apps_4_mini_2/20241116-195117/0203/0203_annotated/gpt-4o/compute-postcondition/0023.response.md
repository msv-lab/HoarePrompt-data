The value of `d_index` is increased by `n` and appended to `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` changes as it now contains one additional element, which is `d_index + n`. The previous values of `d_queue` and `d_index` are not specified, but we know that `d_index` is less than `r_index`. Therefore, the output state is: `d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, `d_queue` has one more element which is `d_index + n`, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, `d_queue` has one more element which is `d_index + n`, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`**
