The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, which is removed from `d_queue` by the `pop(0)` method. The state of `d_queue` is affected as it will now have one less element. The value of `r_queue` remains unchanged, and since `d_queue` had at least one element, `d_index` will hold that first element. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` remains unchanged, and `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` is unchanged, and `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue**
