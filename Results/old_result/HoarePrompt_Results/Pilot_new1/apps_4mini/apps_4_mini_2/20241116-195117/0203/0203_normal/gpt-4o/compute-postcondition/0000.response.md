The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is a positive integer within the range specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The variable `votes` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R'**.
