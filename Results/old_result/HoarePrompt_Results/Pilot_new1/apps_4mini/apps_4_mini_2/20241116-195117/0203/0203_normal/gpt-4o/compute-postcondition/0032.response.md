Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the index that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` is updated by appending `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated by appending `r_index + n`. This ensures that either `d_queue` has a new value based on `d_index` or `r_queue` has a new value based on `r_index`, depending on their comparative values.***
