The code appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `r_queue`. The previous values of the affected variables include `n`, `votes`, and `v`, but they are not directly impacted by the append operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `votes`, and `v`, along with the addition of `i` to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`; `r_queue` now includes the value 2.**
