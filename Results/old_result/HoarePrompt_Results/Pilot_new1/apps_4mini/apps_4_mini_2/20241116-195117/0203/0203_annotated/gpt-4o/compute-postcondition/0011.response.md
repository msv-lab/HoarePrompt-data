The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The variable `i` has a value of 1, and since `d_queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list prior to this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the value 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character of `votes`; `d_queue` is [1]**
