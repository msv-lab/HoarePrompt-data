`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` can be either 0 or 1, so after execution, `remocrats` will be 1 or 2. The values of `n` and `fractions` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is either 1 or 0, and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is either 1 or 0, and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2**
