The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1, but we do not have the previous value of `i` or the state of `r_queue`. Thus, the output state reflects that `i` has increased by 1 and that `i` is now being added to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` is appended to `r_queue`**.
