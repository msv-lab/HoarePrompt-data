According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. If `fractions` has more than 2 characters, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, and `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `fraction` is updated to the next character in the `fractions` string. Since `fraction` is currently the second character, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `fraction` should be the third character in the string, and `n` should be adjusted to reflect that there are at least 3 characters in `fractions`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `fractions` is a non-empty string, and `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`.**
