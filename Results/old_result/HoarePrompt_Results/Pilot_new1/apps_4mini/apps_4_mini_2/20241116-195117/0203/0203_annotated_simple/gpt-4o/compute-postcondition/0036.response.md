The `d_queue` is modified by appending the value of `d_index + n`. The value of `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is added to it. The original `d_queue` had at least one element, and now it will have one additional element after the execution of this code.

Since `d_index` is the first element of `d_queue` and `n` is a known integer, the new element that gets added to `d_queue` will be `d_index + n`. The `r_queue` and other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `d_queue` after appending the new value, while `r_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one additional element which is `d_index + n`, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the element removed from the front of `r_queue`.**
