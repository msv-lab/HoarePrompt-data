Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, the program prints 'D', indicating that there are remaining 'D' votes to process. If `d_queue` is empty, it implies all 'D' votes have been processed, and the program prints 'R', indicating that there are no 'D' votes left to process, regardless of the state of `r_queue`. If both queues were empty initially, the program does not execute the loop and simply prints 'R', reflecting that all votes have been accounted for.***
