Postcondition: ***`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes with `d_index + n` appended if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` has one more element with `r_index + n` appended. In both cases, `r_queue` has one less element, `n` is the length of the `votes` string, and `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`.***
