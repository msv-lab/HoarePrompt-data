The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that must satisfy the constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the provided constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It returns a result based on the characteristics of these inputs.**
