The code initializes `d_queue` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `votes` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list**
