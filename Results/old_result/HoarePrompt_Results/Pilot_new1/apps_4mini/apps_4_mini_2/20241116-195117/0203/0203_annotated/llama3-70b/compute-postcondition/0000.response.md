The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that represents a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The variable `fractions` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` based on the input received.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `n` is an input integer**.
