The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous value of `d_index` is known, and `n` is an additional value that is not specified but will be added to `d_index`. The state of `d_queue` will change as a new element is added, while `d_index` and `r_index` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `d_queue` with the new value.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the value that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `d_queue` now has a new value `d_index + n` appended.**
