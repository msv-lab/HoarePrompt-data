Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, if the second character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 (resulting in either 1 or 2), and `remocrats` remains either 0 or 1. Otherwise, if the second character is not 'D', `depublicans` remains either 1 or 0, and `remocrats` is increased by 1 (resulting in either 1 or 2).***
