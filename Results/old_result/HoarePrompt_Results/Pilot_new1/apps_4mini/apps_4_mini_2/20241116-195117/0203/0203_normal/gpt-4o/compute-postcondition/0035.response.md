The value of `r_index` is assigned the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation. After the execution, `r_queue` will have one less index as the front element is removed. The values of `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less index; `d_index` is the value that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation; `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less index; `d_index` is the value that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation; `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation.**
