According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. If the string has more characters, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `fractions` is a non-empty string, and `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`. For the loop to execute one more time, `fractions` must have at least 4 characters, and `fraction` must be the fourth character in the string.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least 4 characters, `fraction` is the fourth character of `fractions`**
