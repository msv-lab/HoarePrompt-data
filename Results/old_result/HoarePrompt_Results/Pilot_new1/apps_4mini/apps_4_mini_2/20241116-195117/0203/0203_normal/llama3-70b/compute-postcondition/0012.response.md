The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1**
