According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k`. The variable `i` will start at 1 during the first iteration. The state of `n` and `seen` does not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
