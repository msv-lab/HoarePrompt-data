According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and we need to ensure that `i` remains less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 4 in order for `i` to be valid for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` ≥ 4, `i` is 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `n`.**
