The code `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The previous state indicates that `remainder` is `n % 2`, and `seen` is initially 0. The value of `seen` will change as it now includes the `remainder`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`**
