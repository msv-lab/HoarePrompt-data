The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function does not specify any output or return values in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified range, but the behavior or return value of the function is not defined in the given output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, both integers constrained between 1 and 10^18, but the return value is not specified.**
