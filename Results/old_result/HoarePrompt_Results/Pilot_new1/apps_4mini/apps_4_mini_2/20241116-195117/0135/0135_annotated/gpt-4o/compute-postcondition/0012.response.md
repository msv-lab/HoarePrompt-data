The value of `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `i` is 3. The value of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, and since `i` is 3, the possible values of `remainder` can be either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `n`. However, since `remainder` is already specified to be either 0 or 1, it indicates that `n` must be either a multiple of 3 (resulting in 0) or one more than a multiple of 3 (resulting in 1). The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.**
