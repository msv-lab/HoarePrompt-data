The value of `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. Since `i` is 2, `remainder` will be the result of `n` modulo 2. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (which is an integer between 1 and 10^18) and `i` (which is 2). The value of `remainder` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.**
