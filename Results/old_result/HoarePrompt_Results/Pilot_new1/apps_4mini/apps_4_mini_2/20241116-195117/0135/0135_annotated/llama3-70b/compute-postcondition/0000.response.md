The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` takes a space-separated string input and `map(int, ...)` converts each split string into an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within the range of \(1\) to \(10^{18}\). Therefore, after executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values from the input as integers. The output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
