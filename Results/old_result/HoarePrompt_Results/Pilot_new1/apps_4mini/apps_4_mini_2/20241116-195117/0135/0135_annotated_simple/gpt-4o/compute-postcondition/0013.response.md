According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `k` is at least 3, it does not prevent the loop from executing again, but we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to be at least 4 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
