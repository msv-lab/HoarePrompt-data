The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 2, so `remainder` will be the result of `n % 2`. The other variables `k`, `seen`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`**
