The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details about what the function does or returns based on `n` and `k`, we cannot define its functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, but it operates under the constraints that n and k are integers within the specified range. The return value is not defined based on the provided information.**
