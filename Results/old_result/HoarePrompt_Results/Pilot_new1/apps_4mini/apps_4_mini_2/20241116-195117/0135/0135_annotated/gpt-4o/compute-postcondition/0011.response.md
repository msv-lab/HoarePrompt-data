According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3, and `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.**
