To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and output hints, we will analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if all the remainders of `n` when divided by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. If any two remainders are the same for different divisors, the output should be "No"; otherwise, it should be "Yes". The input constraints are `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```
1. The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty set `seen` to track remainders.
3. It iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
4. For each integer `i`, it calculates `n % i` and checks if this remainder has already been observed:
   - If it has, it prints "No" and exits.
   - If not, it adds the remainder to the `seen` set.
5. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Edge Case Consideration:
- If `k = 1`, the only remainder calculated will be `n % 1`, which is always 0. So the output should be "Yes".
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the remainders will start repeating after `i = n` (specifically, `n % n = 0` will be the same as `n % 1`).
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where `k < 1`, but according to constraints, `k` will always be at least 1.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state that the function checks if the remainders are unique and that if `k` is less than 1, it prints "Yes". However, given the constraints, `k` will never be less than 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if all remainders are distinct for the given range of `k`. However, it fails to account for the scenario where `k >= n` leading to duplicate remainders. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders will be:
- `4 % 1 = 0`
- `4 % 2 = 0`
- `4 % 3 = 1`
- `4 % 4 = 0`

This results in non-unique remainders. Thus, the program would output "No" correctly in this case, but it also needs to handle cases where `k` is sufficiently large compared to `n`.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
