Output State: **`seen_remainders` will contain the unique remainders of `n` modulo each of the integers from 1 to `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. If `k` is 0 or negative (which is outside the specified limits), the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If any `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is at least 1, then after the loop executes, `seen_remainders` will contain at most `k` unique values, and `i` will be equal to `k` after the last iteration.**
