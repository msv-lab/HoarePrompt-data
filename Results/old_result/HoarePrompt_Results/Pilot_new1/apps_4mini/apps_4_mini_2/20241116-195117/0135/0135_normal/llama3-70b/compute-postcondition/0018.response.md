The code executes an `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately. Therefore, no variables are modified or returned, and the program halts without further changes to the state. The output state reflects the current values of the variables before the termination.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is now `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'**
