The function `func` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are positive integers with constraints that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; and `a` and `b`, which are distinct integers representing apartment numbers in the range from 1 to n·m·k. The function does not return a value directly mentioned in the output, so we will not specify return cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers) and a, b (distinct integers representing apartment numbers), and operates within the specified constraints.**
