The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `apartment` is an integer within the range defined by `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`. The operation calculates the remainder when `(apartment - 1)` is divided by `(m * k)`, which gives the position of the apartment within its block.

Since the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `floor_within_block` is calculated but remains unspecified.

Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
