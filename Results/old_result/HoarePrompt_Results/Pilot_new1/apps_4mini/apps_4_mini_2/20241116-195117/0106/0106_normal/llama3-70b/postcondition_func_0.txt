The function accepts input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculates the minimum time required to move between two floors in a building with `n` floors, `m` rooms per floor, and `k` blocks of rooms, factoring in both vertical and horizontal movements. It returns the total time based on the calculated block and floor times, which includes a fixed time for each movement. The function does not handle cases where the input values are out of expected ranges or where `a` equals `b`, which could lead to incorrect calculations or assumptions.
