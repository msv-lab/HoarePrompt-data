To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet provided and its impact on the existing variables.

1. The `min_walk_time` variable is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
2. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are already calculated based on the expressions given in the initial state. However, we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, so we cannot compute exact values for `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
3. The `min` function will select the lesser of the two calculated times, but without specific numerical values, we cannot determine what those values will be.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation without specific values for `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
