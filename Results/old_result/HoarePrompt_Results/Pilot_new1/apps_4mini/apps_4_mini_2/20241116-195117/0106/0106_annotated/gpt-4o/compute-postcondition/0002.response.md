To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. **Initial State**: `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. This means `floor_within_block` has a specific value based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```
   floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
   ```
3. In this line, `floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `floor_within_block` is known from the initial state, and `k` is used to perform integer division.

Since the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, we can only state the relationships and calculations based on the initial state.

Thus, `floor` is calculated as `(floor_within_block // k) + 1`, but we do not have the exact numeric values to provide a definitive output.

Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k); `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`**
