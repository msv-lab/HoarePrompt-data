The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `a` and `b`, using `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input values to integers. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values assigned to `a` and `b` based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer**
