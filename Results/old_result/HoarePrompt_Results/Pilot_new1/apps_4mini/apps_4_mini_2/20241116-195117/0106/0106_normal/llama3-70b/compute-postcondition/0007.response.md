Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a_floor` is in the range 1 to m; `b_floor` is in the range 1 to m; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.***
