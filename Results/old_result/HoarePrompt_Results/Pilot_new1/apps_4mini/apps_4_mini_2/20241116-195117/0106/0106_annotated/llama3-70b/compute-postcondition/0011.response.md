Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to new input values; `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range 1 to n·m·k; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10; otherwise, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In both cases, `min_floor_time` will always be at least 10 due to the constant addition in the formula.***
