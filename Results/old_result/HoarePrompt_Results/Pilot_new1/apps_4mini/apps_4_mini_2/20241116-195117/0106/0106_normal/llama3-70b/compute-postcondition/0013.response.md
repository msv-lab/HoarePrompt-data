The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters since the parameter list is empty. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the specific return value or behavior based on the constraints alone. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently unclear due to the absence of output details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are integers within the range 1 to 1000, and a and b are integers within the range 1 to n·m·k, where a is not equal to b. The specific output and functionality are not defined.**
