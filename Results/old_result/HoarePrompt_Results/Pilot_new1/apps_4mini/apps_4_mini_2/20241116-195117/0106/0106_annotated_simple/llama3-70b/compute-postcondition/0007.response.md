Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. `a` and `b` are integers. `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.***
