To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables involved. 

The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. This means the value of `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the current values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state mentions that `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, but the value of `block` does not directly affect the calculation of `floor_within_block`.

Since we do not have specific values for `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, we will denote them as they are. The output state reflects the calculation of `floor_within_block`, which is determined using the current values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `floor_within_block` is (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
