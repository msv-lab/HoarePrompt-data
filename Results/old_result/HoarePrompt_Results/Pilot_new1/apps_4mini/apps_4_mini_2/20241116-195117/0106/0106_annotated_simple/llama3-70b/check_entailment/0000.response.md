To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the code step by step, considering the problem description and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**: The program takes three integers `n`, `m`, `k` which represent the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor, respectively. It also takes two integers `a` and `b`, representing the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha.
2. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered from 1 to `n * m * k`. The first apartment on the first floor of the first block is numbered 1, and the last apartment is `n * m * k`.
3. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The program calculates which floor and block (entrance) each apartment belongs to:
   - The floor is determined using `(apartment_number - 1) % m + 1`.
   - The block is determined using `(apartment_number - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
4. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time to move between blocks is calculated based on the minimum distance in either direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), multiplied by 15 seconds.
   - The time to move between floors is calculated based on the absolute difference in floors, with an additional 10 seconds for the elevator wait time.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
    if (a_floor > b_floor) :
        min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
    else :
        min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
    print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect Floor Time Calculation**: The calculation of `min_floor_time` does not account for the case where Edward is on the same floor as Natasha. In that case, he should not use the elevator, and the time should be 0 seconds for the floor transition, but the current logic adds 10 seconds unnecessarily.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the scenario where `a` and `b` are both on the first floor of their respective blocks, which would mean Edward can directly walk to Natasha without needing to go to another floor or wait for the elevator.

### Example Case Where It Fails
Consider the input:
```
3 1 5
1 2
```
- Edward is in apartment 1 (Block 1, Floor 1).
- Natasha is in apartment 2 (Block 1, Floor 1).
- The program will calculate `min_floor_time` as `(1 - 1) * 5 + 10 = 10`, which is incorrect because Edward can just walk to Natasha without using the elevator or taking extra time.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails to account for the scenario where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor and unnecessarily adds elevator wait time, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases. 

Correctness: **False**
