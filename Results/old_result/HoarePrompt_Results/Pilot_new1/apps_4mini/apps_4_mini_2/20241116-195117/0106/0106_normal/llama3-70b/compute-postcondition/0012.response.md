Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` and `b_floor` are integers within the range 1 to `m`; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; and the final output is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
