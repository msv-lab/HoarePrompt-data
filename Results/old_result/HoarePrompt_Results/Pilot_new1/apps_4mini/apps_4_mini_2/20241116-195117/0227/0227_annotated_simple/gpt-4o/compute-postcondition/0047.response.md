The value of `can_form` is assigned to `False`, which is its previous value. Thus, the state of `can_form` remains unchanged. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `m` is an integer increased by 1 from its initial value, `assigned` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `x` remains undefined.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is an integer increased by 1 from its initial value, `assigned` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `x` remains undefined**
