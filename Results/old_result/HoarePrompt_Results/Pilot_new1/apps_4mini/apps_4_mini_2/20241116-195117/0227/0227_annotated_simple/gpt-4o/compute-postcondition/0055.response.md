The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains an integer greater than its initial value, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, and `i` is equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
