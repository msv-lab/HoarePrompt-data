The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the count of how many elements in `a` (from index 1 to n-1) cannot be formed by the sum of any two distinct elements in `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct integers, and returns the count of elements in a (from index 1 to n-1) that cannot be formed by the sum of any two distinct elements in a.**
