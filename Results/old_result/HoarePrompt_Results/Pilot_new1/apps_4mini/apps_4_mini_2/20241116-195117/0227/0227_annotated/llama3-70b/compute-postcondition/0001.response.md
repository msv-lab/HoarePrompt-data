The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will take input from the user, split that input into separate strings, convert those strings into integers, and then create a list of those integers. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. Since the input will determine the values of `a`, the output state will reflect that `a` is now populated with user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers based on user input**
