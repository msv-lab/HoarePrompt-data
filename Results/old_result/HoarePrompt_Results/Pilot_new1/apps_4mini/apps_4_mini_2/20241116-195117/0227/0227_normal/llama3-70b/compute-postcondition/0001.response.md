The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means `input()` will accept a space-separated string of integers, and `map(int, ...)` will convert each of those string representations into integers. The list will then contain these integers, which are distinct and fall within the specified range. The value of `n` indicates how many integers will be in the list `a`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, but `a` is now populated with the integers provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct integers**
