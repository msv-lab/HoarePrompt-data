Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the execution continues without any modifications to `can_form`.***
