Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It returns the count of elements in `a` that cannot be represented as the sum of two distinct elements from the set of previously processed elements. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 since the only element cannot be represented as a sum.**
