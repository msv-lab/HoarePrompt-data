Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first and second elements of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains undefined, and the program continues executing beyond this point.***
