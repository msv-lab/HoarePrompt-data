The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a collection with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
