The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer `a[k]` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the count of how many elements in the list `a` cannot be represented as the sum of two distinct elements from another specified list referred to as 'assigned', which is represented by the value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the count of elements in `a` that cannot be represented as the sum of two distinct elements from 'assigned'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, and returns the count of elements in a that cannot be represented as the sum of two distinct elements from another specified list.**
