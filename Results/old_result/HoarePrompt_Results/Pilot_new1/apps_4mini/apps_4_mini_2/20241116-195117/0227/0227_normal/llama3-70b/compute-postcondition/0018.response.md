Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. It counts how many integers in the sorted list are not double the previous integer, starting with a count of 1. If the count exceeds 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. The function does not validate the input for `n` or the values in the list, so it assumes they are provided correctly within the specified constraints. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 since there are no comparisons to make.**
