Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1, and `m` remains an integer greater than its initial value. The variable `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `assigned` is a non-empty iterable. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False, `m` is unchanged, and `i` is still equal to `n - 1.***
