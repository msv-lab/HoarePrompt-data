Postcondition: ***`a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, `m` stays the same, `i` is 3, `assigned` has at least 4 elements, and `x` is the fourth element in the list. If `a[i] - x` were in `assigned`, `can_form` would be set to True and the program would break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
