Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than its initial value, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable with at least two elements, and `i` is equal to `n`. If the expression `a[i] - x` evaluates to a value that exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
