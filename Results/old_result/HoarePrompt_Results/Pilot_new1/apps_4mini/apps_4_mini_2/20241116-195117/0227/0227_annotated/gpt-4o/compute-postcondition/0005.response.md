The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False**
