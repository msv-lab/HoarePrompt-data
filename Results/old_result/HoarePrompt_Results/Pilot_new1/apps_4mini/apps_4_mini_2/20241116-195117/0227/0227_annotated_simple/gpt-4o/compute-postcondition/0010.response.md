Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False.***
