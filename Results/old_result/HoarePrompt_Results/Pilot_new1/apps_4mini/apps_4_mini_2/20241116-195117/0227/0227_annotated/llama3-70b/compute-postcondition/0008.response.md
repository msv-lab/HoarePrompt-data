According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, `i` can be increased to 2 for the next iteration, and `a[i]` will be the third element in the sorted list `a`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it ensures that there are at least 2 elements in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to 2 and ensure that `a[i]` is the next element in the sorted list.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 2**
