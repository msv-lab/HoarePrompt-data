The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `assigned`, `x`, and the element `a[i] - x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is `True`, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a collection with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element in `assigned`.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a collection with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element in `assigned`**
