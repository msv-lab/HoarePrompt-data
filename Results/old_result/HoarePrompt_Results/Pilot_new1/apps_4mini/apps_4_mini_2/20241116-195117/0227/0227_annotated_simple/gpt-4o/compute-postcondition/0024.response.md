Output State: **If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1; if `can_form` is True, the value of `m` remains unchanged; if `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is unchanged; if `assigned` contains only one element, the loop executes once, and if the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False and `m` is increased by 1; `assigned` now contains the element `a[i]`.**
