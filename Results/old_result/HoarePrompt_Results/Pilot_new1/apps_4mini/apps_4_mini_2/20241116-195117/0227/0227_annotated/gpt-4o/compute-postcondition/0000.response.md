The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). The specific order of the integers in `a` is not provided, but the sorting operation will rearrange them in increasing order. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` has been sorted, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers**
