The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It sorts the list `a` and counts how many elements from index 1 to `n-1` cannot be formed by the sum of any two distinct elements from the processed elements in `a`. The function returns this count, which is represented by the variable `m`. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 since there are no elements to form sums from.
