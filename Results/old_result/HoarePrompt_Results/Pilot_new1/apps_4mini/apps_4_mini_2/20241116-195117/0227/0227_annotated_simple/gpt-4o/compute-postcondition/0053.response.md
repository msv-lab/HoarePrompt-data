According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `assigned`. Since `i` is equal to `n-1`, it implies that `assigned` has been fully traversed, and `x` would be the last element of `assigned` in the current iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` must contain at least one more element after the last one processed. 

Since `assigned` is stated to remain a non-empty iterable, and `i` is currently at its maximum index (`n-1`), this suggests that `assigned` must be adjusted to have at least one more element, and `i` should be set to `n` (if `n` is the length of `assigned`).

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` should be adjusted to contain at least one more element, and `i` should be incremented to reflect the next index.

State: **`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`, `m` remains an integer greater than its initial value, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, and `i` is equal to `n`**
