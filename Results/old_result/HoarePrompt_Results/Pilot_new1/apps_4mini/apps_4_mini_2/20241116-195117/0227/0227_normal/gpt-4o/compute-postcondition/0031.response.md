Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, leaving `m` unchanged (or increased by 1 if `can_form` was False), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, `m` may be increased by 1, and all other conditions remain unchanged.***
