The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. Since it was already `True`, the state of `can_form` remains unchanged. Other variables (`i`, `n`, and `assigned`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` is a list with at least 3 elements.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` is a list with at least 3 elements**
