Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower (though `n` is stated to be at least 1), the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains [0] (only the initial value).**
