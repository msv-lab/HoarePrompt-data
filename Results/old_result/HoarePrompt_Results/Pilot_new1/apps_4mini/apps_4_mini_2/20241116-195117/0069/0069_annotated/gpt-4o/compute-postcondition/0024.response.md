The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The initial state mentions that `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is not present in the `prefix_balances` list. The execution of the code does not affect these variables but modifies the `results` list by adding a new element. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is not present in the `prefix_balances` list, and `results` now contains an additional `0`.**
