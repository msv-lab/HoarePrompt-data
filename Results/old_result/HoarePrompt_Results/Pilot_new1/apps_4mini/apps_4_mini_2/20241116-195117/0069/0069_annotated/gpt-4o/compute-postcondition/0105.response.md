Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size at least 2 initialized with zeros, `n` is at least 1, `b` is 0, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a non-zero integer. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This includes the case where `x` equals `b` leading to a division by `balance` that is valid and non-negative.***
