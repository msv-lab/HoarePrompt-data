Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with cumulative balances based on string `s`, and `balance` is determined by these balances. If `balance` is 0, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains -1; otherwise, it contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the count of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, reflecting the number of valid balances that can be adjusted to reach `x`. This accounts for all edge cases, including when `n` is 0, where `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
