According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, initialized to zeros, which indicates that it can accommodate the loop's indexing. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and at the start of the first iteration, `i` will be 1. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length greater than or equal to 2 (i.e., `n` is at least 1), `i` is 1, `balance`, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged**
