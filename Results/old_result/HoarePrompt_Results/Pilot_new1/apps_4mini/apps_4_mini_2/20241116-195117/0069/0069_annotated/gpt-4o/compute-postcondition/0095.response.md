Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros; if `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances[i]` reflects the cumulative balance up to the i-th character of `s`, and `balance` equals 0. Additionally, the value `x` exists in the `prefix_balances` list. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains all zeros and `balance` is also 0.***
