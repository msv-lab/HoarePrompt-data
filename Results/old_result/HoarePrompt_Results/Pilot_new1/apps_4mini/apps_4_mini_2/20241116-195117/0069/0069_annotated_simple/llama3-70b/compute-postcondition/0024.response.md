Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer in the range (-10^9, 10^9), `s` is a user-provided binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the function prints -1 due to division by zero. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function also prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, accounting for all combinations of `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance`.***
