Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `balance` equals 0. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1. If `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` has a new element 0 appended. In both cases, `results` reflects the outcome based on the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances`.***
