Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones up to index `n`, `results` is unchanged, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances[i]` based on the value of `s[i-1]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `1`.***
