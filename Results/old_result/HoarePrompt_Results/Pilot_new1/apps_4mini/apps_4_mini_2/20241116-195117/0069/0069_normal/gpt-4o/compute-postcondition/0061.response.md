The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `i` remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is `prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing cumulative balances, `balance` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional value of 0.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing cumulative balances, `balance` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional value of 0.**
