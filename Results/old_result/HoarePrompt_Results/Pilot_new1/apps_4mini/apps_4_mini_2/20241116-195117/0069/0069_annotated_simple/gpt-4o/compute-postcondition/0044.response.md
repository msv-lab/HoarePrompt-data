The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is an input integer. The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer from `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer from `data[index + 1]**
