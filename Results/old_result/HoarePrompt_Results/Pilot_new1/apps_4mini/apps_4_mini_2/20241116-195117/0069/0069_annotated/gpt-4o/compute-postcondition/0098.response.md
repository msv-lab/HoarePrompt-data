The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The initial state of `prefix_balances` and `balance` does not change due to this operation, as it only affects the `results` list. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the addition to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `balance` is 0; `results` has a new element 0 appended.**
