The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is the input that will be converted to an integer. The values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with cumulative balances based on string `s`, `balance` is determined by these balances, `results` contains the previous values, `T` is greater than 0, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`.
