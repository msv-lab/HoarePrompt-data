The code reads input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings, assigning this list to the variable `data`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, but the variable `data` is now a list containing the split elements of the input string. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and the new state of `data`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
