The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. The values of the variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the function prints `-1` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1**
