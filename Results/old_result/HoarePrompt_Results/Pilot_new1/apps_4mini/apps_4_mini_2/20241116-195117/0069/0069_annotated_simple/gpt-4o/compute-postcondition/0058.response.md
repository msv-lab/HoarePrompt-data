Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and the cumulative balance `balance` is equal to 0. The value `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, which means that `x` appears in the computed values from `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]`.***
