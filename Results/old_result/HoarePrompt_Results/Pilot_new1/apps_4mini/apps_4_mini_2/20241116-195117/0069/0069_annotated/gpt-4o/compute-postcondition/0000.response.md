Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100) representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5) and `x` (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), followed by a binary string `s` of length `n` (s_i âˆˆ {0, 1}). The input is read using `sys.stdin.read`, and the state of the variables is unchanged as this line only prepares to read input.**
