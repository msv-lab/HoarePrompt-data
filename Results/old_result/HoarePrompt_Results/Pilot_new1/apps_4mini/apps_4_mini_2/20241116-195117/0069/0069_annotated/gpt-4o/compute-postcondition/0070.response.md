The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `b`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 2, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`**
