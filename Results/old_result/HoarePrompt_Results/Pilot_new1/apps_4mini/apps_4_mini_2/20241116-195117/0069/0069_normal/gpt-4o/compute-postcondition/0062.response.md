Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing cumulative balances, `balance` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and if `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. Conversely, if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `0` is appended to `results`. Additionally, if `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
