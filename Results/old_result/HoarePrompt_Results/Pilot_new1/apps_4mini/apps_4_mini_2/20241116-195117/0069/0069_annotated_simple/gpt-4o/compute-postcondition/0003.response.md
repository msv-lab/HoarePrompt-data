The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The initial values of `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `T`, `n`, and `x`, along with the new value of `index`.

Output State: **`T` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `index` is 1**
