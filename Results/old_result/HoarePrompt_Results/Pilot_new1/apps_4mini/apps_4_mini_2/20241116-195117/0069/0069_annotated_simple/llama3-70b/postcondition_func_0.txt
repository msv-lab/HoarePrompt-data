The function accepts an integer `T` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes two integers `n` (the length of a binary string) and `x` (an integer), followed by a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s` (denoted as `balance`). Depending on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, it outputs either `n + 1`, `-1`, or a calculated value based on the difference. If `T` is less than or equal to 0, the function does not perform any operations. Additionally, the function does not have a return value; it only prints results.
