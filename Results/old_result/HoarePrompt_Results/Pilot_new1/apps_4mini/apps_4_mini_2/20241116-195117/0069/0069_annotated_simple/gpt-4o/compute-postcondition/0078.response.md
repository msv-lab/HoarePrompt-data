Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated based on how many values `b` in `prefix_balances` satisfy the conditions that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes this count. In the case where `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of size `1` with all elements as 0, and the loop does not execute, ensuring that the results remain unaffected by any calculations.***
