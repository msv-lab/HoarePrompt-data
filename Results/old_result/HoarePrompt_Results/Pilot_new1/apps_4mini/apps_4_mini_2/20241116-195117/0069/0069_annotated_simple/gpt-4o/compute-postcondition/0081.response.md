The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` retrieves an element from the `data` list at the position `index + 1` and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `T` is greater than `_`, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, and `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]**
