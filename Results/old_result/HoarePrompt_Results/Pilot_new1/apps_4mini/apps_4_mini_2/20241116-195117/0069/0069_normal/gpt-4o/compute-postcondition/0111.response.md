Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 4 elements, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`, `index` is 4, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 2. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented to 3. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 2.***
