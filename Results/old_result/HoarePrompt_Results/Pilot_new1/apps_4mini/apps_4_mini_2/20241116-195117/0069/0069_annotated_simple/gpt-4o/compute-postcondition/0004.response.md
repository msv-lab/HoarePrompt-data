The line of code initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables, which are `T`, `n`, `x`, and `index`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new empty list.

Output State: **`T` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
