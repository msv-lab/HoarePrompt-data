Output State: **If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, and `results` remains unchanged. If `T` is less than 1, the outer loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list. If `results` is not empty, the loop will execute for each element in `results`, printing each `result`. After the loop executes, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `results` contains the computed results based on the conditions described, and `balance` is either 0 or a non-zero value that leads to a non-empty `results`.**
