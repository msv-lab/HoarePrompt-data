The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` depend on the content of `s`, which is an input string. The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 1, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`**
