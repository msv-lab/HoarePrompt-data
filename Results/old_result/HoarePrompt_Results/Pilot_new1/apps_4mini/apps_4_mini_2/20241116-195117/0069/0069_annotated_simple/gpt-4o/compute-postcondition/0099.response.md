Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, with the last value being 0. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include 0. In both cases, the integrity of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged.***
