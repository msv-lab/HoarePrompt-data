The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the evaluation of the character `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, we look at `s[0]` (the first character of the string `s`). If `s[0]` is '0', we add 1 to `prefix_balances[i - 1]`, otherwise, we subtract 1. The variable `i` is 1, and the previous state of `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, so `prefix_balances[0]` is 0. 

The output state will depend on the value of `s[0]`:
- If `s[0]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
- If `s[0]` is '1', then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.

Thus, the output state can be expressed as:
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[0]`; if `s[0]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[1]` is 1; if `s[0]` is '1', then `prefix_balances[1]` is -1.**
