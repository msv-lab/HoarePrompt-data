The code reads input data and splits it into a list of strings using `input().split()`. The variables `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged at this point because the input has not yet been processed into these variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the input data is now stored in a list format but does not change the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `s` is a binary string of length `n`; the input data is now split into a list.**
