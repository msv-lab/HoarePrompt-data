The code updates the value of `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, and the value of `s[n]` affects the calculation. Depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or not, `prefix_balances[i]` will be incremented or decremented by 1. 

Since the exact values of `s` and `prefix_balances` are not provided, we can only describe the impact of the operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[n]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[i]` is either `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '0' or `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1` otherwise.**
