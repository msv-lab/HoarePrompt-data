Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, initialized with the cumulative balance based on the characters in string `s`. The value of `balance` is not equal to 0, indicating that the cumulative balance after processing the characters of `s` is either positive or negative. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, and `prefix_balances[i]` represents the balance after processing the first `i` characters of `s`. If `n` is 0, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
