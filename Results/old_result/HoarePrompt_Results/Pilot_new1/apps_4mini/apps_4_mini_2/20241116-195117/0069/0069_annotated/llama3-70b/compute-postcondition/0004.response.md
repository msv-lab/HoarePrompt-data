The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` depend on the content of the input string `s`, while the other variables `T`, `_`, `n`, and `x` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s**
