The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is less than 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is less than 26**
