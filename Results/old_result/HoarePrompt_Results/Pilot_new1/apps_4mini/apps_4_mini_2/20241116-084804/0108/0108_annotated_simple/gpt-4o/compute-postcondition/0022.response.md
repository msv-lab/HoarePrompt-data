Postcondition: ***If `j` is equal to the length of `target`, then the function prints `target`. If `s` is empty, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, resulting in the function printing -1. If `s` contains characters but not all from `target`, `i` is the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26, leading the function to print -1 as well.***
