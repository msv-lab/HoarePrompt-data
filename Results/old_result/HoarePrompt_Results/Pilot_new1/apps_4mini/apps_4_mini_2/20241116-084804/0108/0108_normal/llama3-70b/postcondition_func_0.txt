The function accepts a string input consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` by replacing each character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet for each occurrence of that character. If the length of `res` equals 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function ignores any characters in the input that are not lowercase English letters and does not process them, which may lead to `res` being shorter than 26 even if the input contains other characters.
