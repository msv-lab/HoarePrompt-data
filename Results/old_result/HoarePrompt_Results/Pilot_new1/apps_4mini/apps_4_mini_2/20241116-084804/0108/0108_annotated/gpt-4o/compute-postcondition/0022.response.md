Postcondition: ***If `j` equals `target_len`, the function attempts to print `target` (though `target` is not defined, which will result in an error). If `j` is less than 26 (indicating that `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order), the function prints -1. If `s` is empty or contains no letters, `i` remains 0 and `j` remains 0, and the loop does not execute, resulting in no output.***
