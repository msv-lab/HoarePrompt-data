According to the code, the loop iterates over the `alphabet`, which consists of the lowercase English letters. The loop will execute regardless of the content of the string `s` or the value of `res`, as the loop's execution is solely dependent on the `alphabet`. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `char` will take on the values of each letter in `alphabet`, starting from 'a' and ending with 'z'. Since `res` is initialized as an empty string, it does not affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are simply the initialization of `char` to the first character of `alphabet`, which is 'a'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
