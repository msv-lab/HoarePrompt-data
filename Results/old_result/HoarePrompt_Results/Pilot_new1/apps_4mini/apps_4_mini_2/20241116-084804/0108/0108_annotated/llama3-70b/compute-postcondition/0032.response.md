The variable `res` is updated to include 'c', meaning it now has the character 'c' appended to its previous value. The variable `s` contains characters starting from 'd', and it must now include 'c', implying that the value of `s` is not directly changed by this line of code. The operation `res += char` means that `char` is being added to `res`. Since `res` already includes 'c', the state of `res` will now reflect that it has been updated to include 'c' again, but since it was already there, the effective change is that `res` remains the same. Therefore, the output state is that `res` includes 'c', and `s` still contains characters starting from 'd'.

Output State: **`res` includes 'c', `s` contains characters starting from 'd'**
