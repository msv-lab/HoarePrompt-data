According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is 3,
- `j` is less than 26,
- `target_len` is 26.

Since `j` is less than 26, that condition is satisfied. However, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)` for the loop to execute one more time. The string `s` has a length greater than 2, which means `len(s)` is at least 3.

To ensure that the loop can execute once more, we need to adjust `len(s)` to be greater than 3, which guarantees that `i` (which is 3) is still less than `len(s)`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 3; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is less than 26**
