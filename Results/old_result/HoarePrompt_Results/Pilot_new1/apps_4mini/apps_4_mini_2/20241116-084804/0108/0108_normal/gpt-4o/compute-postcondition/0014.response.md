Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of user input with a length greater than 1; `j` is either 0 or 1, and after the execution of the if statement, if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `i` is increased by 1. If `j` was originally 0, it can become 1, and if `j` was originally 1, it can remain 1 (if `s[i]` is equal to `target[1]`) or stay the same if it is not. The condition `target_len` is greater than `j` ensures that there are still characters in `target` to match against.***
