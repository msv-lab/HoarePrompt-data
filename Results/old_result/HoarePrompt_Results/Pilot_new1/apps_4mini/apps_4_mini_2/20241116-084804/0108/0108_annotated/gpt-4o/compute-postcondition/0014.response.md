Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; and `j` is less than 26. If the character at index 2 of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is increased by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.***
