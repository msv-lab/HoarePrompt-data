Postcondition: ***`res` is a string containing characters from `s` transformed into the next character in the alphabet for each occurrence, with `s` unchanged. If the length of `res` is exactly 26, the function prints `res`. If the length of `res` is less than 26, the function prints -1. In cases where `s` contains no characters from the alphabet, `res` remains an empty string, and the function prints -1. Additionally, any characters in `s` that are not in the alphabet are ignored during processing, ensuring they do not affect the length of `res`.***
