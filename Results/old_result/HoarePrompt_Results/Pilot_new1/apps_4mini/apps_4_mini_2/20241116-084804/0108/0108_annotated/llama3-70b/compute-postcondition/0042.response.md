Postcondition: ***`res` is a string that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' if the original string `s` had at least one character from 'a' to 'z', and `s` will be empty after processing. If `res` contains exactly 26 characters, the function prints `res`. If `res` is empty, indicating that `s` contained no characters from 'a' to 'z', the function prints -1.***
