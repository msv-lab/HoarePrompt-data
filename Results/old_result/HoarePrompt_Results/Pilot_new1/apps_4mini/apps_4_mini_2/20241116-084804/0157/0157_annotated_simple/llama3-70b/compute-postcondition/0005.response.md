The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, the function returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the specific output behavior is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three positive integers representing quantities of different fruits.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.**
