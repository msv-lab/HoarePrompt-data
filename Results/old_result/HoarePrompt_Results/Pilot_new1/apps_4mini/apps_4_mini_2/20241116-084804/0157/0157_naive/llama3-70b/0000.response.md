Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the given ratio of lemons, apples, and pears (1:2:4). 

Here's how it works:
1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It calculates the maximum possible number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since 2 apples are needed for each lemon.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since 4 pears are needed for each lemon.
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as `min_lemon + 2 * min_lemon + 4 * min_lemon`, which gives the total amount of fruits based on the ratio.

This logic correctly handles all edge cases, including when there are not enough pears or apples to make any compote. For example:
- If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the program correctly returns `0` because there are not enough pears (4 are needed for 1 lemon).
- If `a = 4`, `b = 7`, and `c = 13`, the program returns `21`, which is the correct total for 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.

Since all potential cases are handled correctly, the program is correct.
