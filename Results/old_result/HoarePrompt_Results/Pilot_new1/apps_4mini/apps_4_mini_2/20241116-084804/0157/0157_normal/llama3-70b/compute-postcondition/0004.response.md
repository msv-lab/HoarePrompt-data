To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first need to analyze the initial state and then the impact of the code.

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `min_lemon` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

1. The variable `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The code then executes the print statement: `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)`.
3. This expression can be simplified as follows:
   - The term `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be factored:
   - `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`.

Therefore, the output will be `min_lemon * 7`.

The output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the calculated `min_lemon`, along with the expression that has been printed.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and the output printed is min_lemon * 7**.
