The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the quantities of these fruits. However, since the specific output conditions are not provided, we cannot detail the return values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
