To calculate `total_fruits`, we first need to determine the value of `max_lemons`. Given the initial state, `max_lemons` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which means it will take the minimum of the three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Once `max_lemons` is calculated, `total_fruits` is then computed as follows:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```
This can be simplified to:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
```

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
