Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9 and `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with `(b - a) / c` being non-negative, the output is 'YES'. In all other cases, the output is 'NO'.***
