To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to check if a number `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence defined by:
- First element `s_1 = a`
- Common difference `c`

The sequence can be represented as:
- `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for `i = 1, 2, 3, ...`

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Breakdown of the Code Logic:

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The sequence is constant (all elements are `a`).
   - The program checks if `a == b`. If true, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".
   - This is correct because if `c` is zero, the only element in the sequence is `a`, and hence `b` can only be equal to `a` to appear in the sequence.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.
   - The first condition ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by some integer steps of size `c`.
   - The second condition ensures that the number of steps taken (i.e., `(b - a) / c`) is non-negative, which means `b` is either equal to or greater than `a` in the case of a positive `c`, or less than or equal to `a` in the case of a negative `c`.
   - This logic correctly captures all necessary scenarios for the sequence when `c` is not zero.

### Testing Edge Cases:

1. **Example where `c = 0`:**
   - Input: `10 10 0`
     - Output: "YES" (correct)
   - Input: `10 5 0`
     - Output: "NO" (correct)
   
2. **Example where `c > 0`:**
   - Input: `1 7 3`
     - Output: "YES" (correct)
   - Input: `1 8 3`
     - Output: "NO" (correct)
   
3. **Example where `c < 0`:**
   - Input: `10 -10 -5`
     - Output: "YES" (correct, as the sequence would include `10, 5, 0, -5, -10`)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`, handling all specified edge cases correctly. 

Thus, I could not find a single case where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
