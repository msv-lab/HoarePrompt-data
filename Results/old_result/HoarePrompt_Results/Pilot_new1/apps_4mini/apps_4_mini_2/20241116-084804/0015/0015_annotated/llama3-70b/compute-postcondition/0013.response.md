Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This includes edge cases where `a` and `b` are at the boundaries of the allowed range.***
