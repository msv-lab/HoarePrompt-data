To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations closely.

### Problem Description:
The sequence `s` is defined such that:
- The first element is `a` (i.e., `s_1 = a`).
- The difference between any two neighboring elements is `c` (i.e., `s_{i} - s_{i-1} = c`).

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Code Analysis:
The program checks two main cases based on the value of `c`:

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The program checks if `a == b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This logic is correct because if `c` is 0, the sequence does not change, and the only element in the sequence is `a`.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` (i.e., whether `b` can be reached from `a` by steps of size `c`) and if `(b - a) / c >= 0` (to ensure that we do not go backwards in the sequence).
   - This logic is also correct because it ensures that `b` is indeed an element of the sequence defined by `a` and `c`.

### Edge Cases:
The annotations mention that the program handles edge cases, including when `a` and `b` are at the boundaries of the allowed range (-10^9 to 10^9). 

### Examples from the Problem Description:
1. **Input: `1 7 3`**
   - The sequence is `1, 4, 7...` and `7` is present. The output is "YES".
   
2. **Input: `10 10 0`**
   - The sequence remains `10`. Since `a` equals `b`, the output is "YES".
   
3. **Input: `1 -4 5`**
   - The sequence is `1, 6, 11...` and `-4` is not present. The output is "NO".
   
4. **Input: `0 60 50`**
   - The sequence is `0, 50, 100...` and `60` is not present. The output is "NO".

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The logic for both `c == 0` and `c != 0` is sound and correctly handles various scenarios, including edge cases.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description's requirements without missing any cases.

Correctness: **True**
