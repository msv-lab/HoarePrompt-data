The code prints the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user; the value of `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0; and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user; the value of `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0; and the output is 'NO'**.
