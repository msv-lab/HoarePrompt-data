Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with `(b - a) / c` being non-negative, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, 'NO' is printed. This ensures that all edge cases regarding the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are covered.***
