The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The initial conditions state that `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is equal to 0, and `a` is equal to `b`, and the function prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is equal to 0, and `a` is equal to `b`; the function prints 'YES'**
