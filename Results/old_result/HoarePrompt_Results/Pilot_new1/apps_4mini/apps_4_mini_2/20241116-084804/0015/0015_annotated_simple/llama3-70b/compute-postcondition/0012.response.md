Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is negative, zero, or positive, ensuring all scenarios are accounted for.***
