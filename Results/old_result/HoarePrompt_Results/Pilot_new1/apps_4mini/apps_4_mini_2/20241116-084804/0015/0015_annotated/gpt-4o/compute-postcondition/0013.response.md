Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with `(b - a) / c` being greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, including when `c` is not 0 but either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, 'NO' is printed.***
