The code prints 'YES', indicating that the conditions based on the initial state have been satisfied. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program successfully executed the print statement.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with values based on user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of the division (i.e., (b - a) / c) is greater than or equal to 0; the program prints 'YES'.**
