The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and there are no other variable assignments or computations. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from input as integers. The value of `c` is not equal to 0. The difference `b - a` is not divisible by `c` or the result of `(b - a) / c` is negative, and the output is 'NO'.**
