Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` was initially False; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is True if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and `i` is 0. If `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]` or `used_cubes[i]` is already True, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` remains False.***
