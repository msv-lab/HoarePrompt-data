Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True and `found` is set to True. If either condition is not met, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains in its previous state.***
