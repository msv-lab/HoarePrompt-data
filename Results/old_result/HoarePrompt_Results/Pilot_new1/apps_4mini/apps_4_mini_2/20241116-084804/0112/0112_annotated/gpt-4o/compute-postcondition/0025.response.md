According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` collection. If `digits` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that if `found` is False, the function returns False, and if `n` is 0, `used_cubes` remains unchanged. However, since the loop is iterating over `digits`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more digit to iterate over.

Since the state indicates that `found` is False, we must ensure that there is at least one additional digit in `digits` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `digits` contains at least one more digit than it did at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least one more digit, `n` is at least 1, `used_cubes` remains unchanged**
