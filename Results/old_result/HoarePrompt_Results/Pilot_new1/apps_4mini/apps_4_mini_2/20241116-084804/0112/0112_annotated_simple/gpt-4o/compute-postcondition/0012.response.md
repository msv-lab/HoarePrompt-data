The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, but it is already set to `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `found` remains `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where `used_cubes[1]` is now True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is True.**
