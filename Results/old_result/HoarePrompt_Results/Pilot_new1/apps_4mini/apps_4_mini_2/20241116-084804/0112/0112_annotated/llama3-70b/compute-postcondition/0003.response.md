According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. The loop will execute if `cubes` contains at least one list, which is guaranteed since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Therefore, `cubes` must contain at least one list of integers. 

At the start of the loop, `cube` will take the value of the first list in `cubes`. Since `n` is defined to be at least 1, we can assume that `cube` is now the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
