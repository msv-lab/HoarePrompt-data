The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` is not specified, but it is now set to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `used_cubes`, `digits`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is set to True; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is now True; `i` is 1; and `used_cubes[i]` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is set to True; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is now True; `i` is 1; `used_cubes[i]` is True.**
