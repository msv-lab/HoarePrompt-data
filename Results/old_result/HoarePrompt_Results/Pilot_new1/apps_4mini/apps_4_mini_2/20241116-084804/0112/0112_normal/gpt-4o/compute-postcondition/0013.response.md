The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is set to True; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is now True; `i` is 1; `used_cubes[i]` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
