According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` variable. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it implies that `cubes` could potentially have one or more lists based on user input. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that `cubes` is not empty. Additionally, at the beginning of the loop, `cube` should be set to the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
