The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
