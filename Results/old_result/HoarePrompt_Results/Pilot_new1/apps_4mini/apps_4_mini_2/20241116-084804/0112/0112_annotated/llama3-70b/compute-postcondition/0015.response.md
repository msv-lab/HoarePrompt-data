The code prints the value of `max_num`, which has been assigned the maximum integer formed by sorting the `digits` set in reverse order and joining them as a string. The values of the other variables (`digits`, `n`, and `cubes`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `digits`, `n`, `cubes`, and the printed value of `max_num`.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of integers, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, and the printed value is `max_num`.**
