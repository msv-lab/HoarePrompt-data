Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where Masha cannot create the number 1 due to the presence of leading zeros on the cubes. If the cubes contain a zero on the face that could potentially be used to form the number 1 (e.g., if all cubes have a zero on the face and no cube has a 1), the program should return 0 immediately, as Masha cannot create any natural numbers starting from 1. However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for leading zeros when forming numbers, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```
In this case, Masha cannot form the number 1, but the program would incorrectly return 0, which is the expected behavior. However, it fails to account for the fact that it should not even attempt to form higher numbers since there are no usable faces to create any number.

This oversight indicates that the program does not fully comply with the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
