Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers found in the lists contained in `cubes`. If '0' was present in `digits`, it has been removed; otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set.***
