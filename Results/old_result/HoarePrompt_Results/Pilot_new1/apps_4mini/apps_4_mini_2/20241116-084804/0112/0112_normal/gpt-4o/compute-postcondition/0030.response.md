Output State: **If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `used_cubes` as a list of `n` elements all set to False. If `digits` has at least one element, for each `digit`, if `found` is True, it indicates that the `digit` was found in one of the `cube_faces` where the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` was initially False, and the respective `used_cubes[i]` is now set to True. If `found` is False for any `digit`, the function returns False, indicating that not all digits could be matched to the cube faces. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `used_cubes` as a list of `n` elements all set to False, and `found` remains False.**
