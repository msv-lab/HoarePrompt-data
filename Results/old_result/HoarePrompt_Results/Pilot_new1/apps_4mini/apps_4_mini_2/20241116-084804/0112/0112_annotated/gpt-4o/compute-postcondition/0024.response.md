Postcondition: ***If `found` is False after the loop, the function returns False, indicating that `digit` was not found in any of the available `cube_faces`. If `n` is 0, `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` stays False, resulting in the same outcome. If `n` is at least 1 and `digit` is not found in any `cube_faces`, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and the function returns False.***
