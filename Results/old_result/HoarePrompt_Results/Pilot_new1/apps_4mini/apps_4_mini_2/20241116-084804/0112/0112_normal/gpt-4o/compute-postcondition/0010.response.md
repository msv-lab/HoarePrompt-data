According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to reflect this increment.

Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, it remains valid as long as it is greater than `i` after the increment. The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` was initially False; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is True if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and `i` is 1.**
