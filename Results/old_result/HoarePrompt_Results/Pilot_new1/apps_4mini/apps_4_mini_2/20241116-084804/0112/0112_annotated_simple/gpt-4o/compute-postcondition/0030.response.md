Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values where each value indicates whether the corresponding cube face has been used; `found` is a boolean that indicates if the current digit was matched with a cube face. If all digits in `digits` are found in `cube_faces`, `used_cubes` will have some `True` values, and `found` will be `True` for each digit processed. If any digit cannot be matched, `found` will be `False` for that digit, and the function returns `False`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, resulting in `used_cubes` remaining a list of `False` values and `found` remaining `False`. If `n` is 0, the loop also does not execute, and the output state reflects that `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` is `False`.**
