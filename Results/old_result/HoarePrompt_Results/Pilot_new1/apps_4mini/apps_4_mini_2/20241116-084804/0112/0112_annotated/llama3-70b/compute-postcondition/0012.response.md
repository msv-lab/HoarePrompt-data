The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' is confirmed to be an element of `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The other elements of `digits` remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the output state is: `digits` no longer contains '0', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers**.
