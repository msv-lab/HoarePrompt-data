According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. The loop will execute for each `digit` in `digits`. For the loop to be executed, `digits` must contain at least 1 element. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers, and `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, the states that need to be adjusted are related to ensuring that `digits` is non-empty.

At the start of the loop, we need to make sure:
- `digits` contains at least 1 digit.
- `digit` will take the value of the first element in `digits` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`**
