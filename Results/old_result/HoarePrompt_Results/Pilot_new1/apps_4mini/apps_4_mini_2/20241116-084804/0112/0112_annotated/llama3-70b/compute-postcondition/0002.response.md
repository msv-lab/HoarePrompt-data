The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. This operation does not affect the values of `n` or `cubes`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `digits` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `digits` is an empty set**
