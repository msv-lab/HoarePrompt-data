The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` is retained, but it is now updated to `True`. The values of `n`, `used_cubes[1]`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `found` is True, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `found` is True, `i` is 1**
