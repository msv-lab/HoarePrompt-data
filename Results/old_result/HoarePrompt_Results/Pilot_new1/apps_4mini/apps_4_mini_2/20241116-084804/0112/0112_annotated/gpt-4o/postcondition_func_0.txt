The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` lists of 6 integers each (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). It returns the largest integer `x` (where `x` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3) such that the function `can_form_number(k)` returns true for all integers `k` from 1 to `x`. If `can_form_number(1)` is false, `x` will be 0; if it is true but `can_form_number(2)` is false, `x` will be 1; if both are true but `can_form_number(3)` is false, `x` will be 2; and if all are true, `x` will be 3. The function does not validate the input parameters for their constraints.
