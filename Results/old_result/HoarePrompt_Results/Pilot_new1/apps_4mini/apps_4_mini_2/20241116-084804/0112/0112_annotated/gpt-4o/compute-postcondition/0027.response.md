According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more digit, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least one more digit, `n` is at least 1, and `found` is False. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the `digits` list must have at least one more digit than it did at the end of the last iteration, meaning the state of `digits` should reflect that there is still an additional digit available. The `used_cubes` remains unchanged, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `digits` to indicate that it has one more digit available, and we need to update the `digit` to reflect the next digit in the iteration.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least one more digit, `n` is at least 1, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `digit` is the next digit in the digits list**
