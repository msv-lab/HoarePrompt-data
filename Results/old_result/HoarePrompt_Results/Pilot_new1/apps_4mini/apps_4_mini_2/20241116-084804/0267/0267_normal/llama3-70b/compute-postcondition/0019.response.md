The operation `dp[n, k] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[n, k]` by taking the remainder of `dp[n, k]` when divided by `MOD`. 

- If `k` is 1, then `dp[n, k]` is initially 9. After applying the modulus operation, the value will be `9 % MOD`.
- If `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` would have been updated based on the loop execution. The new value of `dp[n, k]` will be the accumulated value from the loop iterations, and then it will be updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`.

Since the exact value of `MOD` is not provided, we cannot determine the final numerical value of `dp[n, k]`. However, we can state that it has been modified.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **If k is 1 then dp[n, k] is 9 % MOD; if k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated based on the loop execution and then dp[n, k] is updated to dp[n, k] % MOD.**
