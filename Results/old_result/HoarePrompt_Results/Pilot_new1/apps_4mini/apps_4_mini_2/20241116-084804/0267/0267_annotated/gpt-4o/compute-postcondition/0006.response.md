The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is an unknown value. The value of `MOD` is not specified but is typically a large integer. Since `total_sum` is initially 0, the new value of `total_sum` will be `num % MOD`. Other variables (`l`, `r`, and `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r + 1` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `num % MOD`**
