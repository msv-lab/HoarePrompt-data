The expression updates `dp[n, k]` by adding a calculated value. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is not specified, but it will be updated based on the calculation. The value of `i` is 2, and `k` remains unchanged.

Calculating the new value added to `dp[n, k]`:
- `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` = `9 * 10 ** (2 - 1)` = `9 * 10 ** 1` = `90`
- `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` = `10 ** (k - 2) - 10 ** 1` = `10 ** (k - 2) - 10`

Now, the expression can be simplified to:
`dp[n, k] += 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`

The output state reflects that `dp[n, k]` has been updated with this new value, while `i` is 2 and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged**
