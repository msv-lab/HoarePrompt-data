According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`, because the range in the for loop is defined as `range(1, k)`, which includes values from 1 up to (but not including) `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `k` must be at least 4 (since it needs to be greater than `i`, which is now 3).

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 3 and `k` is greater than 3.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated from -720 to a value greater than -720; `i` is 3, and `k` is greater than 3**
