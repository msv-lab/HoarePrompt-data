The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`, which is unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `(l % MOD)`, `l` is unchanged, `r` is exactly `r`, `num` is `l`**
