The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. Therefore, after executing the code, `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `num` is `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
