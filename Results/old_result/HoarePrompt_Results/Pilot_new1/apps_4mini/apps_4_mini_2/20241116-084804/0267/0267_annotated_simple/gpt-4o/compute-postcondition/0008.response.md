According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `num` in the range from `l` to `r + 1`. The loop can execute again if the current value of `num` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0, and it has been established that `func_1(num, k)` may or may not have been called, but it does not affect the ability of the loop to execute again.

Since `num` is iterating from `l` to `r`, and we are currently at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust `num` to be the next value in the range. If the loop has just finished the last iteration with `num` being `r`, then for it to execute one more time, `num` needs to be adjusted to `r + 1`, which is outside the range and indicates that the loop will not execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `num` is still within the range. Therefore, we need to adjust `num` to be `l` (the starting point) if it hasn't reached `r + 1` yet.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
