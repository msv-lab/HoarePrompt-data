According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are such that 1 <= `l` <= `r + 1` < 10^18. 

To execute the loop one more time, `num` must take on the next value after the last iteration. If `num` was `r` in the last iteration, then for the loop to run again, `r` must be incremented by 1, making `num` equal to `r + 1`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `r` is increased by 1. The value of `l` can remain unchanged, as it is within the valid range.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is incremented by 1, `total_sum` is 0**
