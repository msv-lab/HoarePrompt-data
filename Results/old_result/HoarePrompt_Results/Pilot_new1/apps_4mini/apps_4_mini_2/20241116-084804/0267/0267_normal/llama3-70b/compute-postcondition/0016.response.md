According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates for `i` in the range from `1` to `k-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of `k-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to allow `i` to be equal to `k-1` in the next iteration. 

Since `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `k-1`, the next valid value for `i` would be `k`, which means `k` must be adjusted to be greater than `1` to allow for another iteration.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `90 * (10`, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
