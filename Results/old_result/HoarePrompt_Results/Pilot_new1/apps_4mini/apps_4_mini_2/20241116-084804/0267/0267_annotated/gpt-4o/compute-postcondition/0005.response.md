According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` would be equal to `r` because the loop executes for each integer from `l` to `r`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented to `r + 1`. However, since `r` is already the maximum value in the range, this means that the loop cannot execute again unless `r` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration.

Thus, to allow for one more iteration, `r` must be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r + 1` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is initially 0**
