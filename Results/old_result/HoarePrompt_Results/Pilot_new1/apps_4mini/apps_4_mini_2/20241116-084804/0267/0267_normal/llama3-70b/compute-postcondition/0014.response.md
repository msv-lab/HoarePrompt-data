According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value (which is less than `k`), and the loop is set to iterate from `1` to `k - 1`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`. Since the loop starts at `1`, if `i` was `1` before the last iteration, it would now become `2`. 

No other states need to be adjusted as the value of `dp[n, k]` does not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 * (10`, `i` is 2, `k` is unchanged**
