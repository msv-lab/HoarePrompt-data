Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of digits with length greater than 1, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string, and `c` is the third character of `s`. If the third character `c` is present in the set `t_set`, then `n` will be updated to include `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string.***
