Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` that consists of all characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`. The function then converts this string `n` to an integer and returns it. If `s` is empty or contains no characters from `t`, the resulting integer will be the integer value of `t`.**
