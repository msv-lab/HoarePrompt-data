Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` represents each permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is formed by joining `perm`. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains only one digit, the loop executes once, yielding that single digit as `candidate` if it is valid according to `is_valid_number`. If `sub` is not compatible with any permutation of `chars`, no candidates are yielded despite the loop executing for all permutations.**
