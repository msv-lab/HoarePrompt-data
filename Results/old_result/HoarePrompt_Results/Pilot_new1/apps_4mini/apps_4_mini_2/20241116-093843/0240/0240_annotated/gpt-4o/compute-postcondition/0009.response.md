According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `chars` and the permutations generated from it. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next permutation of `chars`. 

Since `perm` is currently the second permutation, the next permutation would be the third permutation of `chars`. The `candidate` variable would also need to be updated to reflect this new permutation. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted so that `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`. 

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.**
