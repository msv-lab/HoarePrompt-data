The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`, both expected to contain digits. It iterates through each character in `s` and concatenates those characters that are also present in `t` into a new string `n`. After the loop, it appends the entire string `t` to `n`. Finally, it converts the concatenated string `n` into an integer and returns this value. 

One potential edge case is when `s` is empty; in this scenario, `n` will only consist of the characters from `t`. The final return value will depend on the content of `t`, as it is always appended regardless of `s`. If `s` contains no characters that match those in `t`, `n` will still include all characters from `t`. 

Additionally, if the concatenated string `n` exceeds the maximum size for an integer representation, it could lead to an overflow error or unexpected behavior depending on the context of the execution environment. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`, concatenates characters from `s` that are present in `t`, appends `t` to this result, converts the final string to an integer, and returns this integer value. If `s` is empty, it returns the integer value of `t`. **
