The function accepts two parameters: a non-empty string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the counts of characters in `sub`. It then generates possible numbers from these remaining characters, and returns the smallest number from that set. If no numbers can be generated, the behavior is not explicitly defined.
