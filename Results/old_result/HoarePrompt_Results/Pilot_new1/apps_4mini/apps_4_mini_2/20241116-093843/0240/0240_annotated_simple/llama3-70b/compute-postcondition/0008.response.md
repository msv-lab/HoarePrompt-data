Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` now contains the character `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged, which means it could either be empty or retain its previous value, provided that it originally contained `c` if `c` was in `t_set`.***
