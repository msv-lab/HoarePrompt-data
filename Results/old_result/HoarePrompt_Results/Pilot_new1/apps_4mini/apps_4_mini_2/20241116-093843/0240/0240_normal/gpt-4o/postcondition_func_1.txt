The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`, returning a boolean indicating if `sub` is a substring of `num_str`. However, the code does not check if the length of `num_str` is equal to the length of `sub` as stated in the annotations; it instead checks if `num_str` has the same length as an undeclared variable `n_len`, which may lead to an error if `n_len` is not defined. Therefore, the function does not fully implement the intended logic regarding the length comparison.
