According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will iterate over each character in the string. Since `s` is specified to be a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, we need to ensure that it contains at least one character for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `c` will represent the first character in the string `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `c` should be the first character of `s`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
