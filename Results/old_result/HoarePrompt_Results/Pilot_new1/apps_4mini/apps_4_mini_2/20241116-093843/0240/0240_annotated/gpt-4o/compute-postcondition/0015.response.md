The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars` that can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it generates and returns a list of all possible numbers that can be formed by replacing the occurrences of `sub` in `chars` with any digits from 0 to 9. Therefore, the functionality of the function `generate_possible_numbers` is to accept a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and return a list of all possible numbers formed by substituting `sub` with digits from 0 to 9 in `chars`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and returns a list of all possible numbers formed by replacing occurrences of `sub` in `chars` with digits from 0 to 9.**
