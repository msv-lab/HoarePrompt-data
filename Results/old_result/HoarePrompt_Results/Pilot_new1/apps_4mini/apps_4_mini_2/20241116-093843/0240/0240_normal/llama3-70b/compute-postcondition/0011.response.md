Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least one more character, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and `n` is a string that may contain the second character of `s`. If the character `c` (assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program) is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to be the original value of `n` concatenated with `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged.***
