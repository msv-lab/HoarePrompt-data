The `yield` statement is used to produce a value from a generator function. In this case, `candidate` is yielded, which means it will be returned to the caller of the generator without changing the state of any variables. The variables `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the same as `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**
