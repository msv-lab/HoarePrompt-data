To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The problem description states that a string is an "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. This means that the first half of the string should be a mirror reflection of the second half. 

The function `func_1` checks for this symmetry by comparing characters from the start of the string to the corresponding characters from the end. Specifically, it checks if `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i]` for the first half of the string.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The function iterates through half of the string (up to `n // 2`).
2. It checks if each character from the beginning matches the corresponding character from the end.
3. If any characters do not match, it returns `False`.
4. If all characters match, it returns `True`.

### Potential Issue:
The problem specifies that the string should be "s-palindrome", but it also indicates that the second half should be a mirror reflection of the first half. The provided code only checks for direct equality, which is not sufficient for determining if the string is an "s-palindrome" as defined. 

For example:
- The string "oXoxoXo" is indeed an "s-palindrome" because it is symmetric.
- However, the string "aa" is not an "s-palindrome" because the second half does not mirror the first half.

The code does not account for the requirement that the second half must be a mirror reflection. It treats all characters equally and does not consider the concept of mirroring (which may involve case sensitivity or specific character mapping).

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the logic required to check for "s-palindromes" as described in the problem statement, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure:
For the input "aa", the function would incorrectly return "TAK" instead of "NIE" because it only checks for equality and not for the mirroring requirement.
