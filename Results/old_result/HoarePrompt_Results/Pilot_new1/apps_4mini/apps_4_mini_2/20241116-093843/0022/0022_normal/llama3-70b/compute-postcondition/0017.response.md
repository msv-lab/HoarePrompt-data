Output State: **`is_palindrome` is True if the string `s` is a palindrome, otherwise it is False. If `n` is 0 or 1, the loop does not execute and `is_palindrome` remains True. If `n` is 2 or more, the loop executes at most `n // 2` times, comparing characters from the start and end of the string, and may set `is_palindrome` to False if a mismatch is found.**
