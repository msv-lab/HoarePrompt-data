The code prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, otherwise it prints 'NIE'. The value of `is_spalindrome` is determined by whether `s` is a palindrome or not. Since the initial state indicates that `is_spalindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome and False otherwise, the output will depend on that condition.

If `s` is a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` is True, and the output will be 'TAK'. If `s` is not a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` is False, and the output will be 'NIE'. 

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise it is False; print output is either 'TAK' or 'NIE' based on the value of `is_spalindrome`.**
