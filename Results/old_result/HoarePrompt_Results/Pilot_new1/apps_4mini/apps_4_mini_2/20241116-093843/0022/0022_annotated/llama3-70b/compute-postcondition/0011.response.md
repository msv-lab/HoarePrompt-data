Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 2, and `is_palindrome` is True. If the character at index `i` (which is 1) does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, the state of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged.***
