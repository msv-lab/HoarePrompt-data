Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome. If the characters do match, `is_spalindrome` remains True, suggesting that the check for palindrome status continues.***
