The length of the string `s` is calculated and assigned to the variable `n`. The value of `n` will depend on the length of the input string `s`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a new input string, and `n` is the length of that input string.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string, `n` is the length of that input string**
