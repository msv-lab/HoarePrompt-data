Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome. If the characters match, the function does not return anything, implying that further checks may be needed to determine if `s` is a palindrome.***
