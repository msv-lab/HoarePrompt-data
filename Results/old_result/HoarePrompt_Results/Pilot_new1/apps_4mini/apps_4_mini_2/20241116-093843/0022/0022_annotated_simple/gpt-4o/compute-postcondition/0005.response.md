According to the code, the loop executes while `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n // 2`. Given that `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` is at least 1, which allows for one more iteration. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `s` and `n` remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
