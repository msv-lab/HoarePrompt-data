The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with a non-negative integer `n` that is constrained to the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since there are no specified outputs or conditions given for the function's behavior, we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to be defined by the constraints on `n`, but without additional information on its output behavior, we cannot provide specific return values or conditions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with a non-negative integer n constrained to the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, but the return value is not specified.**
