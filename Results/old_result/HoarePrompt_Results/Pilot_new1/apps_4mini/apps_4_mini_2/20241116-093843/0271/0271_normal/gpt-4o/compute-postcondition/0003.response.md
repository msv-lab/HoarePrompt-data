To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the code provided.

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 10^9, and `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`, which is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 5.
2. The code snippet `result = n - remainder` performs a subtraction where `remainder` is the last digit of `n`.

Since `remainder` is `n % 10`, it can take values from 0 to 5. Therefore, the value of `result` will be `n` minus this last digit. 

The output state will reflect the calculated value of `result` based on the values of `n` and `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, and `result` is `n - remainder`.**
