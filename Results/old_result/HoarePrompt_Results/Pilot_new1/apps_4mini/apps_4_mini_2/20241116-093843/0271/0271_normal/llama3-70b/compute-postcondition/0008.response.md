Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is not a multiple of 10. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the output is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is between 6 and 9, the output is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
