The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`, and it is stated that `remainder` is greater than 5. Therefore, the possible values for `remainder` can be 6, 7, 8, or 9. 

The computation `result = n + (10 - remainder)` will yield different results based on the value of `remainder`:
- If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`.
- If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3`.
- If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2`.
- If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1`.

Thus, the output state can be expressed as:
`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` and is greater than 5; `result` can be `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1` depending on the value of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` and is greater than 5; `result` can be `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`**
