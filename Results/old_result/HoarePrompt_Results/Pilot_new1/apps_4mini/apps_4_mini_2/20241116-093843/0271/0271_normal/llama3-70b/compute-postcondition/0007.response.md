The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` calculates the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer not a multiple of 10 and has a remainder greater than 5 when divided by 10, it follows that `n % 10` will be between 6 and 9. 

Calculating `10 - n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 4, which when added to `n` gives the next multiple of 10.

Therefore, the output state will indicate the value of `n` and the result of the print statement which is `n + (10 - n % 10)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and `n % 10` is between 6 and 9; the result of the print statement is `n + (10 - n % 10)`**.
