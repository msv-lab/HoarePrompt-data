Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function prints `n`. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is between 6 and 9, the function prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
