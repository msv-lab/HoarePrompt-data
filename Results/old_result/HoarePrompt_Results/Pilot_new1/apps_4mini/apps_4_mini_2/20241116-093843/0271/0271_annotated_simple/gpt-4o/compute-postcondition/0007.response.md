To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial state of `n` and how it affects the calculation of `result`, which is not explicitly defined in the provided snippet but is implied by the conditions stated.

1. The last digit of `n` (i.e., `remainder`) is calculated as `n % 10`.
2. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is computed as `n - remainder`.
3. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is computed as `n + (10 - remainder)`, which can yield values from `n + 1` to `n + 4`.

However, since the specific value of `n` is not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. Instead, we can describe the possible range of `result` based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is either `n - (n % 10)` if `n % 10` ≤ 5, or `n + (10 - (n % 10))` if `n % 10` > 5, leading to possible values ranging from `n - (n % 10)` to `n + 4**.
