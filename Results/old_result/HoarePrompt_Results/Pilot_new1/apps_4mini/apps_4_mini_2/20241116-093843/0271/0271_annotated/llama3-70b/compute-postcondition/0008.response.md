Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is not divisible by 10. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the function prints the next multiple of 10 after `n`.***
