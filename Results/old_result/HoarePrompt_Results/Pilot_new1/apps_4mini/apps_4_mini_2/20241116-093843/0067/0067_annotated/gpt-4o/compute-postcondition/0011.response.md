The `print('?')` statement outputs a string `?`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the value of `max_downvotes` is less than or equal to `min_upvotes`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the value of `max_downvotes` is less than or equal to `min_upvotes`; '?' is printed.**
