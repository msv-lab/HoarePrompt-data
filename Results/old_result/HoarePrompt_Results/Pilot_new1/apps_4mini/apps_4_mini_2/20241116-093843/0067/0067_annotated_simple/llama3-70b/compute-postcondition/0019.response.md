Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, and '?' if `x` is not equal to `y`. The function does not handle any edge cases related to input types or values outside the range of integers, and it assumes valid input will be provided. **
