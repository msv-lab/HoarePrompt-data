The value of `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The previous value of `x` is known, and `z` is also an integer based on input. Therefore, `max_upvotes` is calculated as the sum of `x` and `z`. The state of `min_upvotes` remains unchanged as it is equal to `x`. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to new integer values based on input; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`**
