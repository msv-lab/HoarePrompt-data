The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values of the affected variables are `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
