To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output should be:
   - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes and there are no unknown votes.
   - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the input values for `x`, `y`, and `z`, and then uses conditional statements to determine the output based on the following logic:
- If `x > y + z`, it prints "+" (indicating that even with all unknown votes being downvotes, upvotes are still greater).
- If `x < y`, it prints "-" (indicating that upvotes are less than downvotes).
- If `x == y`, it checks:
  - If `z == 0`, it prints "0" (indicating a tie with no unknown votes).
  - If `z > 0`, it prints "?" (indicating uncertainty because unknown votes could tip the balance).
- Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, it prints "?" (this case covers situations where `x < y + z` and `x > y`).

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case (0, 0, 1)**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`: The program should return "?" because the one unknown vote could either be an upvote or a downvote.
   
2. **Case (0, 0, 0)**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`: The program should return "0" because there are no votes at all, resulting in a tie.

3. **Case (1, 1, 1)**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`: The program should return "?" because the unknown vote could lead to either a tie or one side winning.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the provided examples and the edge cases as described above. However, it fails to handle the case where both upvotes and downvotes are zero with unknown votes, which should return "0" instead of "?" if there are no unknown votes.

Thus, there is at least one input case where the program does not behave as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

A specific failing case is when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`, which should return "0" but would not be handled correctly in the program.
