To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
- The result can be:
  - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
  - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
  - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes.
  - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Program Analysis:
The code calculates:
- `min_upvotes` as `x` (minimum possible upvotes).
- `max_upvotes` as `x + z` (maximum possible upvotes).
- `min_downvotes` as `y` (minimum possible downvotes).
- `max_downvotes` as `y + z` (maximum possible downvotes).

Then it evaluates:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`.
3. If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Case where all values are zero (0, 0, 0)**:
   - Expected output: `0` (because upvotes equal downvotes).
   - The program would print `'?'` since `max_upvotes` (0) is not less than `min_downvotes` (0) and `max_downvotes` (0) is not less than `min_upvotes` (0). This is incorrect.

2. **Case where there are only unknown votes (0, 0, 1)**:
   - Expected output: `?` (because the unknown vote could either be an upvote or a downvote).
   - The program correctly identifies this case and prints `'?'`.

3. **Case where there are more unknown votes than either upvotes or downvotes**:
   - For example, (2, 1, 3):
     - Minimum upvotes = 2, maximum upvotes = 5, minimum downvotes = 1, maximum downvotes = 4.
     - The result is uncertain since we can have scenarios where upvotes could be greater or downvotes could be greater depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints describe the program's behavior accurately. They state that the function prints `'-'`, `'+'`, or `'?'` based on the computed maximum and minimum values of upvotes and downvotes. However, they do not mention the edge case of `(0, 0, 0)` leading to an incorrect output of `'?'`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the edge case where all inputs are zero, leading to an incorrect output. Since there exists at least one case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, we conclude the following:

Correctness: **False**.
