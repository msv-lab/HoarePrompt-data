Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. If `max_upvotes` (i.e., `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `y`), a hyphen is printed. If `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), a plus sign is printed. Otherwise, a question mark is printed, which covers the case where `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.***
