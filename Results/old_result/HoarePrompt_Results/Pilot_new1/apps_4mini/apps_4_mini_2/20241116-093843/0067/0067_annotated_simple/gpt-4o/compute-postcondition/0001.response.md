`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are still within the specified range, and `min_upvotes` takes the value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`**
