The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it processes internal values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are integers constrained by the condition 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The specific output of the function is not provided in the prompt, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined due to the lack of output details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is currently undefined based on the provided information.**
