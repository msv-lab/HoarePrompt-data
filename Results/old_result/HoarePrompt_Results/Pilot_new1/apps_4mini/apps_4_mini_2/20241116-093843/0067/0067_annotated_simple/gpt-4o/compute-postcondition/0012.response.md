Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers. If the value of `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), then the output is '+'. Otherwise, the output is '?'. The conditions ensure that `max_upvotes` (i.e., `x + z`) is always greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `y`).***
