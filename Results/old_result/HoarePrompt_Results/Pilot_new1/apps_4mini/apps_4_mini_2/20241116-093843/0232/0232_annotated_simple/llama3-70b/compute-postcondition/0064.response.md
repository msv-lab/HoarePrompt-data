Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating that the desired condition is met, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, while `i`, `j`, and `n` retain their respective values (`i` is n-2, `j` is n-2, and `n` is greater than n-1), and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or incremented from its previous value.***
