Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and for at least one color in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`. If all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
