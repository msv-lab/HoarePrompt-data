Output State: **`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` for at least one `i` and `j` combination. If `n` is 0, `found` remains False, `i` is 0, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary. If `n` is 1, the loop executes at most once, and `window_counts` contains the count of the single color at index 0, with `found` being True or False based on the match with `counts`. If `n` is greater than 1 and no matching counts are found across all iterations, `found` remains False, and `window_counts` will contain counts of colors encountered up to the last iteration. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 0, and in such cases, `found` remains False, `i` is not defined, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` is not created.**
