Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating that a valid window has been found. The variables `i` is n-2 and `j` is n-1, with `n` being greater than n-1, and `window_counts[color]` has been increased by 1 prior to the evaluation of the condition. If the condition is met, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `found`, `i`, `j`, or `window_counts`.***
