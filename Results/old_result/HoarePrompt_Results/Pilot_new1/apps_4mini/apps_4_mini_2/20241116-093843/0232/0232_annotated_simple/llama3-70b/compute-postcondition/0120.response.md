Output State: **If `found` is True, the loop has identified a contiguous subarray of `colors` starting from index `i` that matches the color counts in `counts`, and `window_counts` contains the counts of colors encountered from index `i` to `n-1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if `colors` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains empty, and `found` remains False. If `found` is False after the loop executes, it indicates that no such contiguous subarray was found, `window_counts` contains the counts of colors processed up to that point, `i` will be less than `n`, and `j` will take values from `i` to `n-1`. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 0 or if `colors` is an empty list, resulting in `found` remaining False, `i` and `j` remaining unchanged, and `window_counts` being an empty dictionary.**
