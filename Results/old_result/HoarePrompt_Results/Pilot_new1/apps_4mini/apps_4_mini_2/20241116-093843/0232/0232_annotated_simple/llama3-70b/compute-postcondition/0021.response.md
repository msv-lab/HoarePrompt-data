The code initializes an empty dictionary `window_counts`. The previous state of the variables `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, and `n` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the newly initialized `window_counts`.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is unchanged (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
