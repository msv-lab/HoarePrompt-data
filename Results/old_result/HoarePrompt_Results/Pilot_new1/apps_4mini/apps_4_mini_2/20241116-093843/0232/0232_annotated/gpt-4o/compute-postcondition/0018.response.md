According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `right` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` has taken a value that is less than `n` to continue executing the loop. 

Since the loop is structured as `for right in range(n)`, when the loop starts its next iteration, `right` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `right` to reflect the next value it will take.

Given that `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1 in the last iteration, we don't need to adjust `current_counts` or `desired_counts` for the next iteration, as they are not directly influenced by the loop's range.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `right`, which will be incremented by 1.

State: **`current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1, `right` is the next value in the range from 0 to n-1**
