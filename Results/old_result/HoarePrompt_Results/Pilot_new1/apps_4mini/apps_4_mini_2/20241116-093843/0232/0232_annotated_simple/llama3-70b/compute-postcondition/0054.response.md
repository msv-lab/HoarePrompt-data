The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The previous values of other variables (`found`, `i`, `n`, and `window_counts`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `window_counts`.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is n-1, `n` is greater than n-1, `window_counts` is {}**
