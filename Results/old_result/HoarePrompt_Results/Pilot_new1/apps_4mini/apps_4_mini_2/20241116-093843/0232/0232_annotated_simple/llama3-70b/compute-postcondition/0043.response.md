Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` remains unchanged. If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0. If `color` was already present, its count remains as it was before the execution of the program fragment. In either case, `j` is equal to `i + 1.***
