Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, and `window_counts` now includes `color` as a key with a value of 0 if `color` was not already present. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`.***
