The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged; `found` is True; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `j` is 1; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`; `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1; the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` for all pairs (count, target), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
