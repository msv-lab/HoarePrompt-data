According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to `i + 1 + 1`, which means `j` should be equal to `i + 2`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must still be greater than `j`, which translates to `n` being greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `n` is greater than `i + 2**
