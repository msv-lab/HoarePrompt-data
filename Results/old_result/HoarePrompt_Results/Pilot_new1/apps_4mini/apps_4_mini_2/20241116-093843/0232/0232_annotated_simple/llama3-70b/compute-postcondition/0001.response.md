The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input will provide a sequence of integers. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this operation, but `colors` will now contain a list of integers based on the input provided. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `colors`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and `colors` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and `colors` is a list of integers from input**
