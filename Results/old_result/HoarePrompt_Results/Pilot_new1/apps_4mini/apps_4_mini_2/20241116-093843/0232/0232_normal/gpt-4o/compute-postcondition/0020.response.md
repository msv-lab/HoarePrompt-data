According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `right` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `right` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, `right` needs to be adjusted to `n`, and since `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that it reflects the current state based on the new value of `right`.

State: **`left` is 0, `right` is n, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1**
