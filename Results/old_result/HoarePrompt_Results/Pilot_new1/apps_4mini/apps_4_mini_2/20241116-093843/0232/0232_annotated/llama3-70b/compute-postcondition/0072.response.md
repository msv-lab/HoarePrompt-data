Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If all counts match the targets, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged at 1, greater than or equal to 3, and 2 respectively, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or has been incremented by 1.***
