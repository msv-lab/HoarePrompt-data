Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged; `found` is still False; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `j` is 1; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`; `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1; the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` for all pairs (count, target).***
