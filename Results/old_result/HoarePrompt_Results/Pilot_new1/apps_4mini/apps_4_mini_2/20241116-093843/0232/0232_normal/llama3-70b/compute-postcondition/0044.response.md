The code `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the value of `window_counts[color]` by 1. Since `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it would have been set to 0, so after the execution, `window_counts[color]` will be 1. The other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is still 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is still 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1**
