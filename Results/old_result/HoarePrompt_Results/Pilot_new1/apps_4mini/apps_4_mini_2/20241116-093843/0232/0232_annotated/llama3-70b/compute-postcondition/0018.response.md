Output State: **`color_counts` will contain the count of each unique integer in `colors`. If `colors` is a list with at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `colors`, incrementing the count in `color_counts` for each unique color. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `color_counts` will remain an empty dictionary.**
