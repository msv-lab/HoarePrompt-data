The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The value of `j` is `i + 1`, so `color` will now hold the value of `colors[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `found` remains unchanged, and `j` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `found` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 1**
