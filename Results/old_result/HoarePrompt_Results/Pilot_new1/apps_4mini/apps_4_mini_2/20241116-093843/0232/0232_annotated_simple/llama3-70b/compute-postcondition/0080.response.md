Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating that the desired condition has been met. If the counts do match, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `i` remaining as n-1, `j` remaining as n-1, `n` being greater than n-1, `color` being set to `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` having been incremented by 1 prior to this check. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues without breaking out of the loop.***
