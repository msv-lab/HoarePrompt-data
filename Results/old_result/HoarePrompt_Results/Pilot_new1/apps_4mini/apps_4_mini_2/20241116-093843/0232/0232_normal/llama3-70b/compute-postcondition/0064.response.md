Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False.***
