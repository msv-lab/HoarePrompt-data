Postcondition: ***`found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` at some point during the loop execution. `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` has taken on values from 1 to n-1. If `window_counts` is empty, it contains the counts of colors from index 1 to n-1.***
