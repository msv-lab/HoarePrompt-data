According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 2 and `n` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to run. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will take on the value of `i`, which is 2, on the first iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 2 and can increment until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we require that `n` be at least 3, and `j` starts at 2.

State: **`found` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is 2**
