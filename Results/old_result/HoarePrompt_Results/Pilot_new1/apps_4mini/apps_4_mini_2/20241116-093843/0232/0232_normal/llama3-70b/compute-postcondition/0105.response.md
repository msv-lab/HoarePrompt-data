Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, `found` is set to True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `color_counts` remains unchanged, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `color_counts`, or `window_counts`.***
