The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is less than `t`, `(t - s_i)` is a positive integer. Since `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, it indicates that there is a remainder when `(t - s_i)` is divided by `d_i`. Therefore, `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` will yield a positive wait time.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from bus_routes[0], and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from bus_routes[0], and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**.
