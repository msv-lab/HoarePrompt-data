The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are taken from `bus_routes[n]`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000. The specific values of `s_i` and `t` are not provided, so we cannot calculate a specific numerical result for `wait_time`. However, we know that `wait_time` will be the difference between `s_i` and `t`, which may be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of `s_i` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`; `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
