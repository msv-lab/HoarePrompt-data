The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `chosen_route` cannot be determined. The state of `min_wait_time` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables and the assignment made.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1**.
