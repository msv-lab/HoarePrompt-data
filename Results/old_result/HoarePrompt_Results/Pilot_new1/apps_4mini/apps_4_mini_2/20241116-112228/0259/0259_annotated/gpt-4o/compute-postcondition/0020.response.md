The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is a non-negative float, `chosen_route` is updated based on the shortest wait time, `i` is updated to `i + 1, s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is 0.
