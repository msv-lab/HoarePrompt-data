The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `t`, as well as the new value of `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list**
