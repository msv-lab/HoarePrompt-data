Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is float('inf'), and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to 1. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
