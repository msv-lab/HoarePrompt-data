The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables without any changes to them.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from bus_routes[0], the value of `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`; `wait_time` is 0**
