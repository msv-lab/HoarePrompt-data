The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input, which is split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, and `s` and `d` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, and `s` and `d` are input integers**
