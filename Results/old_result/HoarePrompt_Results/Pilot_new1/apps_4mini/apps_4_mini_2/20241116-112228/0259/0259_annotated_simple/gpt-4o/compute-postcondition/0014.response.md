The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is a positive integer that is less than `min_wait_time`, this means that `min_wait_time` will now take on the value of `wait_time`, which will be less than its previous value of positive infinity. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a positive integer that is less than `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a positive integer that is less than `min_wait_time`.**
