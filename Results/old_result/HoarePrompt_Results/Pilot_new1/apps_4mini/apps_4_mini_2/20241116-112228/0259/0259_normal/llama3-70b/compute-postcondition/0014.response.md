The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, as they are not impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are integers provided by user input; `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are integers provided by user input; `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1**
