The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is derived from `bus_routes[i]`, but since we do not have specific values for `s_i` and `t`, we can only express the relationship. 

Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. The other variables (`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route`) are not directly affected by this assignment in this step.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`**
