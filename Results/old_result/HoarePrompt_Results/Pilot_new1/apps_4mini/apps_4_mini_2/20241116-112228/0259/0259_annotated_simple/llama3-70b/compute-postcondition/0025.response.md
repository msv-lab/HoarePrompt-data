Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, if `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
