According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently equal to `n - 1`, meaning it has reached the last index of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, which means it will no longer be less than `n`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented to `n`. The values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` do not need to be modified as they are not directly affected by the loop's iteration count.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `i` is equal to `n`**
