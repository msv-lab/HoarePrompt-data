The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The list `buses` was initially empty, so after the execution, it will contain one element, which is the tuple consisting of the values of `s` and `d`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, and `s` and `d` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, and `s` and `d` are input integers**
