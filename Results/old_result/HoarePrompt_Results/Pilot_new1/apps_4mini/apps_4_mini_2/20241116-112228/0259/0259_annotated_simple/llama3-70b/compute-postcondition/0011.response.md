According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. To execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted since `t` and `buses` do not affect the loop's execution count.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains three tuples, and the new tuple `(s, d)` has been added.**
