The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`; `wait_time` is 0.
