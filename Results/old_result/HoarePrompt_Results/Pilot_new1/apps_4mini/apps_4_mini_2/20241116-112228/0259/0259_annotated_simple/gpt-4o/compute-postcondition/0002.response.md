According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1, but these values do not impact the execution of the loop itself. The relevant states that need to be adjusted are for `i`, which will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to set `i` to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
