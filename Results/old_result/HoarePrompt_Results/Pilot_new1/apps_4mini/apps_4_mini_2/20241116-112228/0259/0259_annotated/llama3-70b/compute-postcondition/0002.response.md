According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), the loop can execute as intended. However, since the loop variable is not used in the loop body and we are not modifying any state within the loop, we can focus on the initialization of the loop.

The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable, indicating that its value is not needed. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any state related to `_`. 

The only relevant state that needs to be noted is that the loop will run `n` times, but since `buses` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Thus, the state before the loop starts remains valid, and we can summarize it as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list**
