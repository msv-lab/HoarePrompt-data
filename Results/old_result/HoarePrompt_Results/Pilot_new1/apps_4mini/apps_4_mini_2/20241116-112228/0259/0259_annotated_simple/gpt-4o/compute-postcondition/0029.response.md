The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are known, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000) and `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[2]`. Since `n` is greater than 2, it does not directly affect `wait_time`. The exact value of `wait_time` depends on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`, but we can note that `wait_time` will be calculated as the difference between `s_i` and `t`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
