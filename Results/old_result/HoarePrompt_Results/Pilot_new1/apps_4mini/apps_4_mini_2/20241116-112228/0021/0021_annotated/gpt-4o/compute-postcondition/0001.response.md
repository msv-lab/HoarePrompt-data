The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes a space-separated string input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The initial state indicates that `a` was previously a list of `n` distinct integers within the range from 1 to `n`. After this line executes, `a` will now hold the new list of integers provided as input. The previous values of `a` are replaced by the new list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input**
