The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input string of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged as it is still an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The output state will reflect the new variable `a` as a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n based on input**.
