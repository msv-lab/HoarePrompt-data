The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated string of integers, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split string into an integer. This means that `a` will hold a list of integers based on the input provided. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The previous value of `n` is not affected by this operation, but the value of `a` will now be determined by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input.**
