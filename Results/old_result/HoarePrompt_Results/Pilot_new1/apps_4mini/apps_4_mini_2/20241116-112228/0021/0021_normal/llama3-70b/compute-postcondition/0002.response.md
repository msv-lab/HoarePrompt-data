The code assigns the value of `pos1` to be the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, which means that `1` is guaranteed to be present in `a`. The index of `1` in `a` will be a specific position based on the arrangement of the integers in the list.

Since we don't have the specific arrangement of `a`, we can only state that `pos1` will be the index of `1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`.**
