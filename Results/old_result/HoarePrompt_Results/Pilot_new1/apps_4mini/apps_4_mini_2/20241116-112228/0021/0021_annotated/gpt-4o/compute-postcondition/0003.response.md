The variable `max_pos` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is an input integer that lies between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. Since `n` is guaranteed to be in the list `a`, `max_pos` will be the index of that integer in the list. The other variables, `min_pos` and `a`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`.**
