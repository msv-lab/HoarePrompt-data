The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the relationships and constraints defined for `n` and `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n), and performs operations based on these inputs.**
