The code attempts to print `max_distance`, but since `max_distance` cannot be determined due to undefined variables (`dist3` and `dist4` are undefined), it results in an error or undefined output. Therefore, the output state reflects the situation where `max_distance` is not defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in a; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is undefined; `dist4` is undefined; `max_distance` cannot be determined due to undefined variables.**
