The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained by the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained by the condition 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, it returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as n multiplied by the result of dividing `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n` and `multiplier`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a calculated value based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer), and returns a calculated value based on n and a multiplier derived from k.**
