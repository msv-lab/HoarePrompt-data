The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`. The value of `k` can range from 0 to 8, so `multiplier` can take the values of 1 (when k is 0), 10 (when k is 1), 100 (when k is 2), 1000 (when k is 3), 10000 (when k is 4), 100000 (when k is 5), 1000000 (when k is 6), 10000000 (when k is 7), or 100000000 (when k is 8). The values of `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `multiplier` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `multiplier` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 based on the value of `k`**.
