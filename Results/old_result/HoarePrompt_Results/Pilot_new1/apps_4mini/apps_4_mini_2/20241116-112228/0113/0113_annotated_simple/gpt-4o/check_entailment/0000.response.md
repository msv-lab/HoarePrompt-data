To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that aims to calculate the k-rounding of the integer `n`. The k-rounding is defined as the minimum positive integer `x` such that `x` ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by `n`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Multiplier Calculation**: 
   ```python
   multiplier = 10 ** k
   ```
   This line calculates `10` raised to the power of `k`, which determines how many zeros the resulting integer should have.

2. **Calculation of x**:
   ```python
   x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
   ```
   This line computes `x` by multiplying `n` with the quotient of `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n` and `multiplier`.

3. **Return Value**:
   ```python
   return x
   ```
   The function returns the computed value `x`.

### Verification against the problem description:

- **For k = 0**: The output should be `n` itself since any integer has at least 0 zeros at the end.
- **For k > 0**: The output should be the smallest integer that is divisible by `n` and ends with at least `k` zeros.

### Test Cases:

Let's consider the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `375 4` 
   - Expected Output: `30000`
   - Calculation: `multiplier = 10^4 = 10000`, `gcd(375, 10000) = 125`, so `x = 375 * (10000 // 125) = 375 * 80 = 30000`.

2. **Input**: `10000 1`
   - Expected Output: `10000`
   - Calculation: `multiplier = 10^1 = 10`, `gcd(10000, 10) = 10`, so `x = 10000 * (10 // 10) = 10000 * 1 = 10000`.

3. **Input**: `38101 0`
   - Expected Output: `38101`
   - Calculation: `multiplier = 10^0 = 1`, `gcd(38101, 1) = 1`, so `x = 38101 * (1 // 1) = 38101`.

4. **Input**: `123456789 8`
   - Expected Output: `12345678900000000`
   - Calculation: `multiplier = 10^8 = 100000000`, `gcd(123456789, 100000000) = 1`, so `x = 123456789 * (100000000 // 1) = 12345678900000000`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Case with n = 1 and k = 0**: Should return `1`.
- **Case with n = 1 and k = 8**: Should return `100000000`.
- **Case with n = 10^9 and k = 8**: Should return `1000000000000000000`, which is `10^9 * 10^8`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the k-rounding for all tested cases and adheres to the problem description. The logic for calculating the minimum integer `x` that meets the requirements is sound.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases as per the problem description.
