The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input, then finds the next multiple of `10^k` that is greater than or equal to `n`. If `n` is already a multiple of `10^k`, it remains unchanged. The function then prints the resulting value of `n`. There are no return values, and the function does not handle invalid input scenarios, such as non-integer inputs.
