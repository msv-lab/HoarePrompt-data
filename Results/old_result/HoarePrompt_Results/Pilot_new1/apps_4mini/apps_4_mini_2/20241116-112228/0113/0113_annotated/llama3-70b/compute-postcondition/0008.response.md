Output State: **`if n is not divisible by x then n` is incremented until it becomes divisible by `x`, at which point the loop ends. If `n` is initially divisible by `x`, the loop does not execute and `n` remains unchanged. `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
