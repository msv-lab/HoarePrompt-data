Output State: **`if n is initially divisible by x (10^k) then the loop does not execute and n remains unchanged. If n is not divisible by x, the loop executes until n becomes divisible by x, resulting in n being increased to the next multiple of x. The final state will have n as the smallest number greater than or equal to the original n that is divisible by x.`**
