The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so if `n` was previously `n + 1`, it will now be `n + 2`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now `n + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, and `n + 1` is not divisible by `x`.

Output State: **`n` is now `n + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, and `n + 1` is not divisible by `x`**
