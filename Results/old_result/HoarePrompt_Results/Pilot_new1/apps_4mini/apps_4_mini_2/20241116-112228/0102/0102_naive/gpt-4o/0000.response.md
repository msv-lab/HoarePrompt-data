To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Analysis
The function is supposed to convert an integer score (between 0 and 99) into its English word representation. The expected outputs for specific inputs are provided, and we need to ensure that the function covers all necessary cases:

1. **Single-digit numbers (0-9)**: The program should return the correct word representation from the `ones` list.
2. **Teen numbers (11-19)**: The program should return the correct word representation from the `teens` list.
3. **Tens (10, 20, ..., 90)**: The program should return the correct word representation from the `tens` list.
4. **Numbers between tens and teens (21-29, 31-39, ..., 91-99)**: The program should correctly combine the tens and ones with a hyphen.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the code:

- The `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` lists are defined correctly.
- The first condition checks for single-digit numbers (0-9) and returns the corresponding word.
- The second condition checks for numbers in the range 11 to 19, returning the correct word from the `teens` list.
- The third condition checks for numbers from 10 to 99. It correctly handles:
  - Exact multiples of ten (e.g., 10, 20, ..., 90) by returning the corresponding word from the `tens` list.
  - Other numbers (e.g., 21, 35, ...) by concatenating the words from `tens` and `ones` with a hyphen.

### Edge Cases
- The number 10 is handled correctly (returns "ten").
- The number 11 is handled correctly (returns "eleven").
- The number 20 is handled correctly (returns "twenty").
- The number 99 is handled correctly (returns "ninety-nine").

### Finding a Potential Issue
However, there is a critical oversight in the handling of the number 10:
- The `elif` condition for `10 <= n <= 99` should ideally include a separate condition for `n == 10` to handle it distinctly, as it is currently being processed under the logic for numbers greater than 10.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the case for `n == 10`. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
