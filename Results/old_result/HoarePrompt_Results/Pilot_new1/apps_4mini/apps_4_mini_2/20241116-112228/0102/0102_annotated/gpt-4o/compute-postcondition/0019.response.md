Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the string representation of `n` based on its value: it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list if `n` is between 0 and 9, the corresponding string from the `teens` list if `n` is between 11 and 19, and the string representation in the format 'tens-ones' for values between 10 and 99. If `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not return any value. Therefore, it does not handle cases for `n` being less than 0 or greater than 99, which is a missing functionality.**
