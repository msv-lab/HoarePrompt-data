Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `s` from the user, which is expected to be in the range of 0 to 99. It prints the English word representation of `s`. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word from the `tens` list followed by a hyphen and the word from the `ones` list if `s` is not a multiple of 10. The function does not handle inputs outside the range of 0 to 99 and does not return any value; it only prints the result.**
