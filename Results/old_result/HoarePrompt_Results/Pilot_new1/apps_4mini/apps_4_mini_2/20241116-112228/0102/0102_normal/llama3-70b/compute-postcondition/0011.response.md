Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 20, the output is the corresponding string from `teens` based on the value of `s`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is the English word representation of `s`, formatted as a combination of the appropriate string from `tens` and `ones`, with a hyphen separating them if `s` is not a multiple of 10.***
