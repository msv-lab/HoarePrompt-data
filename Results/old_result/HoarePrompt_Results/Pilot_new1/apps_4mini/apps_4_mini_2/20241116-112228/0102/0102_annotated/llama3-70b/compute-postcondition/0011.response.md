Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is less than 20, the printed output is the corresponding string representation from the `teens` list at index `s - 10`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the printed output is the string representation of `s` formatted as tens and ones, where the tens are derived from the `tens` list and the ones are obtained from the `ones` list, with a hyphen separating them if `s` is not a multiple of ten.***
