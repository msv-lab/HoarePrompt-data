The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates based on the internal variable `s`, which is an integer constrained by the condition 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. Since there is no additional output information provided, we cannot determine the specific return values or behavior of the function based solely on the given constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not fully defined in terms of its output. Without additional context or output details, we can only state the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates based on an internal integer `s` constrained by 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. The specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
