Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers. If `N` is exactly 2, the loop executes once; if `N` is greater than 2, the loop executes `N-1` times. If `A` has fewer than `N` elements, the loop will not execute and `gcd` will remain as the first element of `A`.**
