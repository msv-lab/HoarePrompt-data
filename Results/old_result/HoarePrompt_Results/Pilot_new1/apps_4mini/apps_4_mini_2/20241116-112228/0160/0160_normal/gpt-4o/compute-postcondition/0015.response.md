Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `sqrt(x)`, along with their corresponding quotients. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains empty. If `x` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains empty. If `x` is 2, the loop executes only once, adding `1` and `2` to `divisors`. If `x` is a prime number, the loop will execute up to `sqrt(x)` but will only add `1` and `x` to `divisors`. If `x` is a perfect square, the loop will execute until `sqrt(x)` and add the square root only once.**
