The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The previous values of `max_divisor` and `i` are needed to determine the new value of `max_divisor`. However, since the exact previous value of `max_divisor` is not provided, we only know that it is updated as needed. The value of `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. 

Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated as needed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `max_divisor` is now the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated as needed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `max_divisor` is now the maximum of its previous value and `i`**
