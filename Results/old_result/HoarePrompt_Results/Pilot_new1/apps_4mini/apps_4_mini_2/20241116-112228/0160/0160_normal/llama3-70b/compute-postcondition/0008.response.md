The value of `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[i])`, where `i` is 3. The previous value of `gcd` is not specified, but it is updated based on the value of `A[3]`. The value of `N` being greater than 3 implies that `A` has at least 4 elements. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `gcd` based on the calculation involving `A[3]`. 

Output State: **`gcd` is updated to math.gcd(previous_gcd, A[3]), `i` is 3, `N` is greater than 3**
