To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Loop Definition**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, N)`, which means `i` will take on values from 1 to N-1 (inclusive). The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. We need to check if the loop can execute again with the current value of `i` and the value of `N`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. Since `i` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `N` is greater than 3.

4. **Possible Values for N**: The problem states that `N` is an integer such that 4 <= N <= 500. Therefore, `N` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Next Values**: If `i` is currently 3, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 4. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state must reflect that `i` will be 4 and that `N` must be greater than or equal to 4.

In summary, the key adjustments to the state are:
- `i` will be incremented to 4.
- `N` must remain such that it is greater than or equal to 4.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 4 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of integers from input; `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[3]); `i` is 4**
