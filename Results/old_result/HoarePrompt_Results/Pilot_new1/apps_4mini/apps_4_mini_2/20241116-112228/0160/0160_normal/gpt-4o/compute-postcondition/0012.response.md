The value of `i` is `k + 1`, and `x` is at least 4. The operation `x // i` computes the integer division of `x` by `i`. Since `i` is at least `k + 1`, and `x` is at least 4, the result of `x // i` will be a non-negative integer that is added to the `divisors` set. The exact value of `x // i` depends on the specific values of `x` and `i`, but it is guaranteed to be a valid integer.

The output state will reflect that `divisors` now includes `x // i`, and the values of `N`, `K`, `A`, and the condition on `x` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` now includes `x // (k + 1)`; `x` is at least 4; `i` is `k + 1`; `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `k + 1`.**
