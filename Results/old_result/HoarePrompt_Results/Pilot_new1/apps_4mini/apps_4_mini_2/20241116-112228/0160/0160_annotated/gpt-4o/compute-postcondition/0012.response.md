The value `x` is divided by `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. The current value of `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x))`, which is a non-negative integer. The value of `x` is not specified, but it is implied to be a positive integer since `i` is derived from its square root. The state of `divisors` changes as a new element is added, specifically `x // i`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `divisors` has `x // i` added to it.**
