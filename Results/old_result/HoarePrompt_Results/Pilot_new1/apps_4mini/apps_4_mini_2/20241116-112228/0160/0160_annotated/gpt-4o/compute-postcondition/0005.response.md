Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains 1 and `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i` (which is 1). If `x` is any positive integer, `divisors` will include 1 and `x`, while if `x` is 1, `divisors` will only contain 1. There is no else part in the code.***
