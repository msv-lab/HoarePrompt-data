Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged. In all cases, `max_divisor` will be at least as large as its initial value.***
