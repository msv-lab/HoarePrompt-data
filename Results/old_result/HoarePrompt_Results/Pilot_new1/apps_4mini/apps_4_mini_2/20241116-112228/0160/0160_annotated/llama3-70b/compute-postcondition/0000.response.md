The variables `N` and `K` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer within the range of 2 to 500 and `K` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to \(10^9\). The values for `N` and `K` will be provided through user input, which will determine their specific values. Other variables, such as the list `A`, are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9**
