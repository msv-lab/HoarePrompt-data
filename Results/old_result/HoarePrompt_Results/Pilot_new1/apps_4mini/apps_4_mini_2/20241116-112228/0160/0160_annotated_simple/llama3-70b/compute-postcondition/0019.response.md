According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1. Therefore, the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration must be less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

To adjust the state, we need to:
1. Increase `i` by 1 to ensure it will be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` in the next iteration.
2. The maximum value of `i` can be determined as `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to its next value.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated as needed, `i` is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(gcd)), `i` is incremented by 1**
