Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains 1 and at least 2, `x` is at least 9, and `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` will include both `i` (which is 3) and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `divisors` remains unchanged and still includes at least 1 and 2.***
