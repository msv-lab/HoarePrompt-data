The values of `N` and `K` are assigned from the input, where `input` accepts a string of two integers separated by space. The `map` function converts these string values into integers. Other variables, including the list `A`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `N` and `K` are now set to the input values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9**
