The value of `max_divisor` is updated using the maximum of its previous value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` has been incremented by 1, the calculation `gcd // i` will yield a non-negative integer. The previous value of `max_divisor` is compared with this new value to determine the updated value of `max_divisor`. The states of `gcd` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated as the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated as the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1**
