The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then modifies `n` to be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original `n` that is divisible by `x`. Finally, it prints the modified value of `n`. If `n` is initially divisible by `x`, it remains unchanged.
