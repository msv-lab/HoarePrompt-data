The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, which is split into two integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but they are constrained by the conditions given. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values of the two integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
