The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 8, the value of `multiplier` can be 1 (when k is 0), 10 (when k is 1), 100 (when k is 2), 1000 (when k is 3), 10000 (when k is 4), 100000 (when k is 5), 1000000 (when k is 6), 10000000 (when k is 7), or 100000000 (when k is 8). The state of the other variables, `n` and `k`, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
