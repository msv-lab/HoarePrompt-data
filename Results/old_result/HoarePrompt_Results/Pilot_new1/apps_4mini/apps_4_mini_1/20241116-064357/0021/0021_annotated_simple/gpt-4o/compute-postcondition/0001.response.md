The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values split by spaces. The input will provide `n` distinct integers, which will be converted to integers and stored in the list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the new value of `a` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers based on the input**
