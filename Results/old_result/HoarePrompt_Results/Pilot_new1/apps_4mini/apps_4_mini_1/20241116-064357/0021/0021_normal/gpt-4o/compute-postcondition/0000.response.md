The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, but the exact value of `n` after input is not specified. The list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `n` based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n, and `n` is assigned a new input integer.**
