The code assigns the value of `min_pos` to the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of distinct integers from `1` to `n`, the integer `1` will definitely be present in the list. The value of `min_pos` will be the index of `1` in the list `a`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`**
