The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The values of `n` and `max_pos` are needed to compute `dist2`. Since `max_pos` is defined as the index of `n` in the list `a`, it will be a specific integer value, and `n` is also a distinct integer. Therefore, `dist2` will be calculated based on these values.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `max_pos`, and the calculated `dist2`. Since the exact values of `n` and `max_pos` are not provided, we can only describe `dist2` in relation to them.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, and `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`**
