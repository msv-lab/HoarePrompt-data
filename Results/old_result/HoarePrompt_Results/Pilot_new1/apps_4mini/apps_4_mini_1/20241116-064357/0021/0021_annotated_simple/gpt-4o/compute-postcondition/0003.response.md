The variable `max_pos` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers and `n` is guaranteed to be one of those integers (as per the given range), `max_pos` will hold the index of `n` in the list. The variable `min_pos` and the list `a` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers based on the input, `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`.**
