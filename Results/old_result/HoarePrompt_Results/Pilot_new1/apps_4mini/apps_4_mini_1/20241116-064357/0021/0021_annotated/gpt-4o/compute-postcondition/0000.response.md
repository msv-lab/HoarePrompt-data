The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100. The list `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `n` is an input integer**
