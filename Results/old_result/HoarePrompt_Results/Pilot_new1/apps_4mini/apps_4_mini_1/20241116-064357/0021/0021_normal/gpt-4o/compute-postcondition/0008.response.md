The code calculates `max_distance` as the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. Since we do not have specific values for `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, we can only describe that `max_distance` will take the maximum value from these four distances. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, so we cannot provide exact values for `max_distance`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_distance` is determined by the maximum of the four distances.

Output State: **`max_distance` is determined as the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**
