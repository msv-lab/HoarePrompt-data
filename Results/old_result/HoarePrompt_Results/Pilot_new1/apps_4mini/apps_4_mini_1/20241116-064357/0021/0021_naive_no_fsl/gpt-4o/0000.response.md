Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing one swap. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 1 3 4
```
In this case, the minimum element (1) is at index 1, and the maximum element (4) is at index 3. The program calculates the distances from the ends but fails to consider the best possible swap that would maximize the distance.

If we swap 1 and 4, the array becomes:
```
2 4 3 1
```
Now, the positions of 1 and 4 are 3 and 1, respectively, yielding a distance of 2. However, the program would not evaluate this swap correctly because it only considers the positions of the minimum and maximum elements relative to the ends of the array and not the potential swaps that can occur between them.

Thus, the logic does not cover all potential cases, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
