The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The function `abs` computes the absolute value of the expression inside it. The value of `max_pos` is not specified in the initial state, but it represents the index of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute value of `-max_pos`, which is simply `max_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`**.
