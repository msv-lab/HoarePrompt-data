The code `pos1 = a.index(1)` assigns the position (index) of the value `1` in the list `a` to the variable `pos1`. Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, we can infer that the list `a` contains the integer `1`. Therefore, `pos1` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`**
