The code assigns a new list to `a`, which is created by mapping the `int` function over the values obtained from `input().split()`. The previous value of `a` is replaced by this new list. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the output state will reflect that `a` now holds the new list of integers from the input. The value of `n` remains unchanged unless the input is processed to assign a new value to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from input.**
