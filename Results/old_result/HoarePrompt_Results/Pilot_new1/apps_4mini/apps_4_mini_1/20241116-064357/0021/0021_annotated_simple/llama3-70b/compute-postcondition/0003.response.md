The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of `n` in the list `a`. Given that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the impact of this code is that it searches for the position of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `a` contains distinct integers, `n` can either be present in the list or not. However, since the problem does not specify whether `n` is guaranteed to be in the list `a`, we cannot assume a successful index retrieval. 

Therefore, the output state should reflect that `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in the list `a`, but we cannot determine its value without knowing the contents of `a`. Thus, we state that `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`, but we cannot specify a value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`**
