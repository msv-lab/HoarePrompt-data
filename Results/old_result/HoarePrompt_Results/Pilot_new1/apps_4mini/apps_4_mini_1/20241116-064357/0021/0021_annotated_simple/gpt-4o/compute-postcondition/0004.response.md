Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers based on the input, `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`, and `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)` which is `max_pos`.**
