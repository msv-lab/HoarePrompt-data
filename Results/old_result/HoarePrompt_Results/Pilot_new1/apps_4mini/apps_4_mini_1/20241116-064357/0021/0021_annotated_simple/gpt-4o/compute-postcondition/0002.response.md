The code assigns the value of `min_pos` to the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Given that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and assuming that `1` is included in the list `a`, `min_pos` will be the index where `1` is located. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers based on the input, `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.**
