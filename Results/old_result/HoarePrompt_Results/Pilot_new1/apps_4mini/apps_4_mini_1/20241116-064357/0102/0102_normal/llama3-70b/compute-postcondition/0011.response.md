Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is less than 20, the output is the string representation of the number corresponding to `s` in the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is the string representation of `s` in words, formed by concatenating the appropriate string from the `tens` list with the string representation of the unit digit from the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen if the unit digit is not zero.***
