Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer within the range of 0 to 99. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the value of `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` array. If `s` is between 20 and 99, it prints the string representation of `s` in words, combining the appropriate entries from the `tens` and `ones` arrays, with a hyphen if `s` is not a multiple of 10.***
