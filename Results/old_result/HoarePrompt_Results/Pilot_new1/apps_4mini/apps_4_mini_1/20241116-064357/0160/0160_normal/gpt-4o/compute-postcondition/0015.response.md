Output State: **`divisors` will contain all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`, including both `i` and `x // i` for each divisor `i` found. If `x` is 1, the loop won't execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is a prime number, `divisors` will contain only 1 and `x` after the loop. If `x` is a perfect square, `divisors` will include the square root only once. In all other cases, `divisors` will contain the complete set of divisors of `x`.**
