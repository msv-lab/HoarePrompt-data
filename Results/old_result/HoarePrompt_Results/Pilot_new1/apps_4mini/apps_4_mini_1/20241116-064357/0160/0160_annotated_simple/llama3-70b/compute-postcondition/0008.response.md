The value of `gcd` is updated by calculating the GCD of the current `gcd` value and `A[i]`. The previous value of `gcd` is the GCD of the first three elements of the list `A`, and `i` is currently 3, so `A[i]` refers to the fourth element of the list. The output state will reflect the new value of `gcd` after this computation, while `N`, `K`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers from input, `gcd` is updated to the GCD of the previous `gcd` and `A[3]`, `i` is 3**
