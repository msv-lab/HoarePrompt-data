To provide the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet in the context of the initial state.

1. The variable `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. This means `i` is one greater than the integer square root of `x`.
2. The code `divisors.add(x // i)` adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The operation `x // i` computes the integer division of `x` by `i`.

Since we don't have the specific values of `x` and `divisors`, we can only describe the impact of the code based on the initial state:

- The value of `x` is at least `((int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)`, which means `x` is sufficiently large relative to `i`.
- The set `divisors` will now include the value `x // i`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `divisors` has a new element added to it, which is the result of the integer division.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6; `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1; `x` is at least `((int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)`; `divisors` has `x // i` added to it.**
