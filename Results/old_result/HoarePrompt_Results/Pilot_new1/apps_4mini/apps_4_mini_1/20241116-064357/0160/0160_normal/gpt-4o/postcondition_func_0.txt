The function accepts a list of integers and returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than two elements, it returns the first element as the GCD. The function assumes that the input list is non-empty. If an empty list is provided, it may result in an IndexError due to attempting to access the first element.
