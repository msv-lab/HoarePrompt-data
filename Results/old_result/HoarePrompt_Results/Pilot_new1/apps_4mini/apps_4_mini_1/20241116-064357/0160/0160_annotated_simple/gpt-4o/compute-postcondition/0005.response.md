Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains `i` and 1 if `i` is a divisor of `x` (where `x` is 1); otherwise, `divisors` remains unchanged since there is no else part.***
