According to the code, the loop is designed to execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `gcd`. For the loop to execute, `gcd` must be a positive integer, as the square root of a non-positive number does not yield a valid range for iteration. Additionally, the loop will start with `i` equal to 1.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `gcd` is greater than 0. Given that `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, it is also implicitly greater than 0.

State: **`gcd` is greater than 0, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
