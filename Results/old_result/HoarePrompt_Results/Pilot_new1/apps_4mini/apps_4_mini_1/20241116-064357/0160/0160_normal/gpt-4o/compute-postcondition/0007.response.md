The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` is already defined to contain values based on the divisibility of `x`. Since the previous state of `divisors` is not specified, we only know that `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `i` will be added to `divisors`.

Thus, the output state is that `divisors` now includes the value `i`.

Output State: **`divisors` now includes the value `i`**
