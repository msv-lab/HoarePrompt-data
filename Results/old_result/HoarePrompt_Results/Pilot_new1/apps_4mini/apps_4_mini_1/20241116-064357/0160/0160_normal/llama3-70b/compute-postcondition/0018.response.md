Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than 0, and `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`. If `i` divides `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd` when `i` is 1, as `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. If `i` is greater than 1 and divides `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`, and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, it is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Thus, `max_divisor` will reflect the largest divisor of `gcd` found during the execution of the if statement.***
