According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the calculated range based on `gcd`. The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `i` is currently at least 2, we need to ensure that the next value of `i` is still within the range defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 3 (the next integer after the current value of at least 2) and that `gcd` remains such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 3 (to ensure the loop can still execute).

State: **`gcd` is such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 3, `i` is 3**
