Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(gcd)`, or equal to `gcd` itself, depending on the conditions met. If `gcd` is 0 or negative, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is 1, `max_divisor` is 1. If `gcd` is greater than or equal to 2, `max_divisor` is updated based on the divisibility conditions. The value of `max_divisor` is printed.**
