Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x` and returns a sorted list of all its divisors in descending order. If `x` is 1, the function will return a list containing only the number 1. If `x` is a prime number, the returned list will contain only 1 and `x`. If `x` is a perfect square, the square root will be included only once in the list of divisors. The function handles all integers greater than or equal to 1 correctly, but does not account for negative integers or zero, which would not be valid inputs for divisor calculations. **
