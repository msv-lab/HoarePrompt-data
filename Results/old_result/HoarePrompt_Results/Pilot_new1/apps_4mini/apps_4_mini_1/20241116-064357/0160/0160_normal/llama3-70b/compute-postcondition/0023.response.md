Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than 0 and `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. All cases ensure that `max_divisor` retains the largest divisor found so far that divides `gcd`.***
