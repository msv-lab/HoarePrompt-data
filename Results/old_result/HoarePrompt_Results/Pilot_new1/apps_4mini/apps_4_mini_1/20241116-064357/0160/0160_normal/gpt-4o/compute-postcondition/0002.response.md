Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., the remainder when `x` is divided by `i` is 0).***
