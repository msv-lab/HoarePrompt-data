According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken on a value that is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, since the loop increments `i` on each iteration.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Thus, `i` needs to be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `N`, `K`, and `A` do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, and `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
