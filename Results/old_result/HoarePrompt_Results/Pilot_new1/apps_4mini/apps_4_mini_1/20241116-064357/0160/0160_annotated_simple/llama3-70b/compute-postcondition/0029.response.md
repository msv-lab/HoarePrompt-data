According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The variable `i` is used as the loop variable, and it starts at 1 and increments by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is N, which means that the loop has already executed for all values from 1 to N. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented to N + 1. Additionally, we need to ensure that `gcd` is still valid for the loop condition, which is based on `math.sqrt(gcd)`.

Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, we can conclude that `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least N - 1, which means `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least N - 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to N + 1.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is N + 1**
