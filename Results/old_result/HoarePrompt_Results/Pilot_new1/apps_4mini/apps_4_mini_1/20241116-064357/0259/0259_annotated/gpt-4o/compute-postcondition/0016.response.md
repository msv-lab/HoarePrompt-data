Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the selection of the current bus route. This accounts for all scenarios, including when `s_i` equals or is less than `t`, ensuring that the wait time is correctly calculated and updated accordingly.***
