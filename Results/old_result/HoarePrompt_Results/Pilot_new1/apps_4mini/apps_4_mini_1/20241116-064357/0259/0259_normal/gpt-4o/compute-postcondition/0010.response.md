The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The value of `d_i` is taken from `bus_routes[0]`, and since `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, we can calculate `wait_time` as a positive integer. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly stated, but they are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, `d_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
