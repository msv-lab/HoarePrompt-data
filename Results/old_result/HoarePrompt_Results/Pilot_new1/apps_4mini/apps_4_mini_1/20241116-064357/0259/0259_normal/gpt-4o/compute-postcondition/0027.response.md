According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. 

Since `i` is currently less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state for `i` should be `i + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the ability to enter the loop again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` remain unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`**
