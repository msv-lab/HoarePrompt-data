Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route that results in `min_wait_time` (1-indexed). If `n` is 1 or greater, the loop will execute at least once. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, while `chosen_route` remains -1. If all routes result in a wait time greater than or equal to the initial `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` will remain unchanged.**
