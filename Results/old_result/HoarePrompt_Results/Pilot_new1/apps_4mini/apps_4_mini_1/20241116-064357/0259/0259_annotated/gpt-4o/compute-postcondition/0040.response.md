The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, constrained to the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- `t` is a positive integer representing a certain time, constrained to the range (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `(s_i, d_i)` representing the start and destination of a bus route, constrained to the range (1 ≤ s_i, d_i ≤ 100000).

After executing the function body, if there are no routes available (i.e., if `n` is 0), the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, which is denoted as `chosen_route`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time or -1 if no routes are available. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time), and bus_routes (list of tuples of bus routes). It returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, or -1 if no routes are available.**
