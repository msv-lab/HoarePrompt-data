Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum value of `(t - s) % d` for all buses in the list, `ans` is the 1-based index of the bus that provides this minimum time, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, `n` is at least 1. If `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and both `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
