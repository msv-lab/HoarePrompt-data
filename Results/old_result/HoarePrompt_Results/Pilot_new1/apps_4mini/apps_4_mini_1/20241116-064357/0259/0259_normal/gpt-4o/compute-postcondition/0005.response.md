The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the value of `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer (either zero or positive). Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer**.
