Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This ensures that `min_wait_time` always holds the smallest wait time encountered, while `chosen_route` reflects the index of the bus route that offers this minimum wait time. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
