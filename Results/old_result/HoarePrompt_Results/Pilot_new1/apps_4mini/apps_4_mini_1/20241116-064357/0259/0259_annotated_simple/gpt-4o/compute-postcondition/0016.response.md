Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`. In this case, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` (which is 1 when `i` is 0). The value of `wait_time` is a non-negative integer determined by the relationship between `s_i` and `t`, ensuring all edge cases are accounted for, including when `s_i` equals `t`, when `s_i` is less than `t` but the difference is divisible by `d_i`, and when `s_i` is greater than `t`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
