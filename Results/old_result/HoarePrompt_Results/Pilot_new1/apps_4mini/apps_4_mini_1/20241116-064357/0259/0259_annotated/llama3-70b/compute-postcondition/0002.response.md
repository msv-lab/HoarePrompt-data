According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The loop does not depend on the values of `t` or `buses` for execution but rather on the value of `n`. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, the loop can execute as intended. The loop variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during its iterations, but since `_` is a throwaway variable, its specific value does not need to be tracked.

Since the loop is set to execute `n` times, we can state that the loop will run as expected with `n` being greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the loop, `_` will be 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
