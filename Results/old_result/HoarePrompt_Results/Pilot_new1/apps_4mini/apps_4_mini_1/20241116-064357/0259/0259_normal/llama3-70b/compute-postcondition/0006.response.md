The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which are split and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `s` and `d` are not known beforehand, as they depend on user input. Other variables (`n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now assigned input integer values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` now contains one tuple (s, d), `_` is 1, and `s` and `d` are input integers**
