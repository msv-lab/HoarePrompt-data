The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `wait_time` is now `0`, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is 0, `i` is n, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[n]**
