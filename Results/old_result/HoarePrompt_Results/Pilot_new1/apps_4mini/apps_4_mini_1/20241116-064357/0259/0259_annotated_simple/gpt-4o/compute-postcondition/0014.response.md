The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, it means `min_wait_time` will now hold a finite value (the value of `wait_time`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer based on the conditions of `s_i` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer based on the conditions of `s_i` and `t`.**
