According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute again if `_` (which is used as the loop variable) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `_` must be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that n is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing two tuples (the original tuple and (s, d)), `_` is 2**
