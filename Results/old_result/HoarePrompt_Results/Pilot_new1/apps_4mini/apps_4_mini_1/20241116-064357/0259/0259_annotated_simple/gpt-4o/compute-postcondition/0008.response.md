The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial conditions, with `wait_time` now being `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[0], the value of `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`; `wait_time` is 0**
