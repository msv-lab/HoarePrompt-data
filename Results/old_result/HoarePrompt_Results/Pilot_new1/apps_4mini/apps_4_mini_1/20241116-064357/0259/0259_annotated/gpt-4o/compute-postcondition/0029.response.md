The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is derived from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`, and `t` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `t` is also a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `s_i` can vary depending on the specific tuple chosen from the `bus_routes` list. The exact values of `s_i` and `t` are not provided, so we can only express the relationship.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `wait_time` based on the values of `s_i` and `t`, without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a positive integer.**
