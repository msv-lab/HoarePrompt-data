Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min_wait_time`.***
