To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of bus routes `n` and the time `t` when Serval arrives at the bus station.
2. **Bus Route Logic**: For each bus route, it calculates the wait time based on:
   - If the first bus arrives after Serval arrives (`s_i >= t`), the wait time is the difference between `s_i` and `t`.
   - If Serval arrives exactly when a bus is scheduled (`(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), the wait time is `0`.
   - If Serval arrives before the first bus and not at a scheduled time, it calculates the next bus's wait time using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
3. **Choosing the Bus Route**: The program keeps track of the minimum wait time and the corresponding bus route index.

### Potential Issue:
Now, let's consider edge cases:
- If multiple bus routes have the same wait time, the program will choose the one that appears first in the list. This behavior aligns with the problem description since it states that if several buses arrive at the same time, any of them can be printed.
- However, the logic for calculating the wait time may lead to a situation where the program does not correctly identify the first bus that Serval can take if there are multiple buses arriving at the same time.

### Example Case to Test:
Consider the following input:
```
2 3
5 2
3 1
```
- The first bus route arrives at time `5` with an interval of `2` (buses arrive at `5, 7, 9,...`).
- The second bus route arrives at time `3` with an interval of `1` (buses arrive at `3, 4, 5, 6,...`).

For `t = 3`, the wait times would be:
- For the first route: `5 - 3 = 2`
- For the second route: `0` (since he arrives exactly when the bus comes).

The expected output is `2` (the second bus route), but the program will output `1` because it checks the first route first and finds a wait time of `2`, and does not update `chosen_route` when it finds a wait time of `0` for the second route.

### Conclusion:
Since there is an input case where the program does not return the correct bus route Serval should take, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
