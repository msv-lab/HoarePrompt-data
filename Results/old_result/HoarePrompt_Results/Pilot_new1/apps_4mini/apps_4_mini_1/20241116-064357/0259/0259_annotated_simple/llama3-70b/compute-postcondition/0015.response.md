According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list contains at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. The loop uses `enumerate`, which means `i` will start at 0 and will increment with each iteration, while `(s, d)` will represent the elements of the tuples in the list.

To ensure the loop can execute:
1. The `buses` list must contain at least 1 tuple.
2. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, and `(s, d)` should be the first tuple in the `buses` list.

State: **`buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`**
