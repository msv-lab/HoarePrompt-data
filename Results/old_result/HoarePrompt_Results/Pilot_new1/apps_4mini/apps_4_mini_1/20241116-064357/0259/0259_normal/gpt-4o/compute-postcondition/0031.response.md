The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so its previous value is now increased by 1. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, which means they take on specific values based on the updated index `i`. The `wait_time` is then calculated using the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated values of `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is unchanged; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`; `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
