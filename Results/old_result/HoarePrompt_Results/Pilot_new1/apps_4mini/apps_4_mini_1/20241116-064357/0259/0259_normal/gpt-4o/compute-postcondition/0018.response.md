The code assigns the values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]` to `s_i` and `d_i`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, `s_i` and `d_i` will take the values from the tuple located at index `n` of the `bus_routes` list. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is a non-negative integer; `min_wait_time` is unchanged; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
