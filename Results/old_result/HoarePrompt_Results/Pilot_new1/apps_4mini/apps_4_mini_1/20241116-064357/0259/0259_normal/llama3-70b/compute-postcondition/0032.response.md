Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated as (t - s) % d for the tuples in `buses`, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the tuple that produced `min_time`. If `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1. If there are tuples in `buses`, `min_time` will be updated to a finite value, and `ans` will be updated to a valid index based on the minimum time found.**
