Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple representing a pair of integers (s, d) inputted during each iteration. `_` is `n-1` after the loop executes `n` times. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `buses` remains an empty list. Additionally, `n` is always a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000.**
