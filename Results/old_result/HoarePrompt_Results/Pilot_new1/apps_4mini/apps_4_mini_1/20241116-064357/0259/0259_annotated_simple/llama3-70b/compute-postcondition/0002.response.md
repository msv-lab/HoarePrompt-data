According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `buses` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly. However, we need to ensure that the loop variable (represented by `_`) is initialized correctly, even though it is not used in the loop body.

Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute. The loop variable `_` will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations. 

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted before the loop starts are:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,
- `_` can be considered to start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
