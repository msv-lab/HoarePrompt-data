Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`, and `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route that provides this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all `s_i` values are less than `t` and do not align with `t`, then `min_wait_time` will reflect the wait time for the last bus route checked, or remain positive infinity if no valid routes are found. If all `s_i` values are greater than `t`, `min_wait_time` will be the smallest wait time from those routes, and `chosen_route` will indicate which route has the shortest wait.**
