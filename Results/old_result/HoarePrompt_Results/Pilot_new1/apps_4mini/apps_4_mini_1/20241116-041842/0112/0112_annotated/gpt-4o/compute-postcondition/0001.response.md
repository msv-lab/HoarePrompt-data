The variable `used_cubes` is initialized as a list of `False` values, with the length equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `used_cubes` will contain either 1, 2, or 3 `False` values. The other variables (`cube_faces` and `digits`) remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of the digits of `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of the digits of `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values**
