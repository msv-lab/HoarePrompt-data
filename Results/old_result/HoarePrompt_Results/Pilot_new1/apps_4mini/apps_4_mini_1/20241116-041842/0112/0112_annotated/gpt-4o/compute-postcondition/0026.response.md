The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`used_cubes`, `digit`, and the index) are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `found` while noting the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` may have been modified, `digit` is the next element in the `digits` list, and the index is incremented accordingly**
