According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the next element in the `digits` list, and the index has been incremented accordingly. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the index needs to be adjusted to point to the next element in the `digits` list.

Since `digit` is currently the next element, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element after it in the `digits` list. This means the `digits` list must have at least one more element than the current index.

State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` may have been modified, `digit` is the next element in the `digits` list, index is incremented to point to the next element in the list (index + 1)**
