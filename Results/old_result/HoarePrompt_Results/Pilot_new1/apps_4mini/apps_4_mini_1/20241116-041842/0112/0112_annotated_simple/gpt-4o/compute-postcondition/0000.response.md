The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, but we know that the code converts `num` to a string and then creates a list of its digits. Since `num` is not provided, we cannot determine its value or the resulting list of digits. Therefore, the output state reflects that `num` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9; `num` is undefined.**
