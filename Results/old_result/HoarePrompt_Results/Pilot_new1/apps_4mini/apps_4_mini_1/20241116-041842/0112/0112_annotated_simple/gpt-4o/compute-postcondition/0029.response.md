According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, and `digits` has at least one more element, indicating that the loop can execute again. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `digit` to reflect the next element in the `digits` list after the current one. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, we know that the loop can continue executing as long as there are more elements in `digits`.

Given that `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with at least one False value and `found` is False, there are no adjustments needed for those variables regarding their values. 

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to update `digit` to the next digit in the `digits` list, and the length of `digits` must remain consistent (i.e., it should still have at least one more element after the current `digit`).

State: **`used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with at least one False value, `found` is False, `n` is between 1 and 3, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list after the current one, and `digits` has at least one more element.**
