The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is within the range of 1 to 3, and `used_cubes[i]` is already set to `True`. However, the assignment of `found` does not change the state of any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `i` is n, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `found` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `i` is n, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `found` is True**.
