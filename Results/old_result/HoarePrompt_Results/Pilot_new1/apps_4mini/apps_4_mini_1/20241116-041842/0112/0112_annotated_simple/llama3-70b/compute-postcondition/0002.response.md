The code initializes an empty set named `digits`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. The variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 3, and `cubes` continues to hold the user input lists of integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `cubes`, along with the newly created empty set `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from user input; `digits` is an empty set**.
