According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented to 1, and since `n` is still within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), it allows for another iteration. The other states (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found`) do not need to change as they are not directly impacted by the loop index increment.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where `used_cubes[0]` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is False, and `i` is 1**
