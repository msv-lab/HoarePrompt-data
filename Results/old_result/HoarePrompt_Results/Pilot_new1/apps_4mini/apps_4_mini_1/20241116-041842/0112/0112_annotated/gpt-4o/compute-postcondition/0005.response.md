Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `digit` is the first digit in the digits list, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0. The value of `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.***
