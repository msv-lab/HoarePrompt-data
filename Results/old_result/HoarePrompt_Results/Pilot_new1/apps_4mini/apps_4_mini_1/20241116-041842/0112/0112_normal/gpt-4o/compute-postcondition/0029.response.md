According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 4 digits, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 3 digits, and `digit` is the third digit in the list. 

To execute the loop one more time, the list must have at least 4 digits, and `digit` should be the fourth digit in the list. Since the current `digit` is the third digit, the index needs to be updated accordingly.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` is a list of at least 4 digits, `digit` is the fourth digit in the list**
