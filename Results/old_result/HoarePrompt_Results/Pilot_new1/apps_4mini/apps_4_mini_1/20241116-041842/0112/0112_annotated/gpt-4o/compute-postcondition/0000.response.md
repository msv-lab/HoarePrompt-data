The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. The code converts `num` to a string and then creates a list of its digits. However, without knowing what `num` is, we cannot specify the resulting list of digits. Therefore, the output state indicates that the output depends on the value of `num`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, and `digits` is a list of the digits of `num`, where `num` is undefined.**
