The code assigns `True` to the `i`-th index of the `used_cubes` list. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. However, since `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, and `n` is either 2 or 3, the value of `i` must be a valid index within this range. 

The impact of the code is that one of the elements in the `used_cubes` list will change from `False` to `True`, depending on the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change in `used_cubes` depending on the value of `i`, while `n` and `digits` remain as they were.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has one index set to True and the rest remain False**
