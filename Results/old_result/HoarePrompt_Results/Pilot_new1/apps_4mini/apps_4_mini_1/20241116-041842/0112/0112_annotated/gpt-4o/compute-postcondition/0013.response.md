The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where `used_cubes[0]` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
