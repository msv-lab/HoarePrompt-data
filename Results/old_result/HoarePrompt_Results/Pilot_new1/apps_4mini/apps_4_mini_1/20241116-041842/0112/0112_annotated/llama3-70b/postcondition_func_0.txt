The function accepts an integer input `n` (representing the number of cubes), reads `n` lists of integers (each containing 6 integers), and constructs a set of unique digits from these integers. It removes '0' from this set if present, then forms the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order and printing this integer. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. If no digits are present, the function will attempt to form a number from an empty set, which could lead to an error when trying to create the max_num.
