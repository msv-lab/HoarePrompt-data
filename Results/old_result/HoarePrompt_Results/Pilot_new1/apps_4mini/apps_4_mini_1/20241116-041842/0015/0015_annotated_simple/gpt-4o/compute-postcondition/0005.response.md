The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0; and 'NO' is printed.**
