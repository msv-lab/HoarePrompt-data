Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the sequence has a constant value (i.e., when `c == 0`). According to the problem description, if `c` is zero, the sequence consists of repeated elements equal to `a`. Thus, if `b` is equal to `a`, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, it should be "NO". The provided code correctly checks if `b == a` and prints "YES" in that case, but it incorrectly prints "NO" when `c == 0` and `b != a`. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
5 5 0
```
The expected output is "YES" since all elements of the sequence are 5, but the program will output "NO". 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
