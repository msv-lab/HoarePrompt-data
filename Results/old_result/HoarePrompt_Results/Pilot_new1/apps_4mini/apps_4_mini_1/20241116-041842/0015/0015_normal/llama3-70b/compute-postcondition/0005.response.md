The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change, and since `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, they remain in their initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is 0; `a` is not equal to `b`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is 0; `a` is not equal to `b`, and the output is 'NO'**
