Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative quotient, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, including when the difference `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or the quotient `(b - a) / c` is negative, 'NO' is printed.***
