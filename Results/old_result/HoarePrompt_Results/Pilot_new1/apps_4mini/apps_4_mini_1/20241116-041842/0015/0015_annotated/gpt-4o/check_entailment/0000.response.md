To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and how it aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Problem Description
The task is to check if the integer `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The common difference `c` (i.e., `s_{i} - s_{i-1} = c`)

We need to find if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_{i} = b`.

### Key Cases to Consider
1. **When `b` is equal to `a`**: The output should be "YES".
2. **When `c` is 0**: The sequence is constant (all elements are `a`). If `b` equals `a`, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".
3. **When `c` is not 0**: We need to check if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if `(b - a) / c` is non-negative (to ensure we can reach `b` starting from `a` by adding `c` repeatedly).

### Analysis of the Code
The provided code implements the following logic:
1. If `b == a`, it prints "YES".
2. If `c == 0`, it prints "NO" (this is incorrect, as it should check if `b == a` here).
3. If `c` is not 0, it checks:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0` (i.e., `b` is reachable from `a` using steps of size `c`)
   - If `(b - a) / c >= 0` (i.e., ensuring that we are moving in the right direction)

### Discrepancy Identified
The program fails to handle the case when `c == 0` properly. According to the problem description, if `c` is 0, we should only print "YES" if `b` is equal to `a`, and "NO" otherwise. However, the code unconditionally prints "NO" when `c` is 0, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly handle the case where `c` is 0, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

The annotations indicate that the program checks conditions correctly for most cases, but they do not highlight the incorrect handling of the `c == 0` case, which is crucial for correctness. Therefore, the program fails to satisfy the problem requirements fully.
