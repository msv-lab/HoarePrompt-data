To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the program.

1. **Understanding the Sequence**: 
   - The sequence starts with `a` and each subsequent term increases by `c`. The terms can be represented as: 
     - \( s_1 = a \)
     - \( s_2 = a + c \)
     - \( s_3 = a + 2c \)
     - ...
   - The general term can be expressed as \( s_i = a + (i - 1)c \).

2. **Condition for `b` to be in the Sequence**:
   - For `b` to be present in the sequence, there must exist a positive integer \( i \) such that:
     - \( b = a + (i - 1)c \)
   - Rearranging gives us:
     - \( b - a = (i - 1)c \)
   - This implies:
     - \( (b - a) \) should be divisible by \( c \) (i.e., \( (b - a) \% c == 0 \)).
     - Additionally, \( (i - 1) \) must be non-negative, which translates to \( (b - a) / c \geq 0 \).

3. **Special Case When \( c = 0 \)**:
   - If \( c = 0 \), the sequence only contains the value `a`. Therefore, `b` can only be in the sequence if `b` equals `a`.

Now let's analyze the code:

```python
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (c == 0):
        if (a == b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Annotations Review:
- The annotations provided in the code correctly describe the logic and the state of the program after execution of each block.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When \( c = 0 \)**:
   - If `a = 5`, `b = 5`, `c = 0`: Correctly outputs "YES".
   - If `a = 5`, `b = 3`, `c = 0`: Correctly outputs "NO".

2. **When \( c \neq 0 \)**:
   - If `a = 1`, `b = 7`, `c = 3`: Correctly outputs "YES" since \( (7 - 1) \% 3 == 0 \) and \( (7 - 1) / 3 = 2 \) (non-negative).
   - If `a = 1`, `b = -4`, `c = 5`: Correctly outputs "NO" since \( (b - a) = -5 \) is not non-negative.
   - If `a = 0`, `b = 60`, `c = 50`: Correctly outputs "NO" since all terms are multiples of 50 starting from 0, and 60 is not a multiple of 50.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
