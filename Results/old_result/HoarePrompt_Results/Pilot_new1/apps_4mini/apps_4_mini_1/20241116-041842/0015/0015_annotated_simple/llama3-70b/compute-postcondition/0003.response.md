The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not altered by this statement, and their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the value of `c` is 0; `a` is equal to `b`; and 'YES' is printed.**
