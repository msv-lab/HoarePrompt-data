The function does not accept any parameters and reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It checks the value of `c`: if `c` is 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the division result `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; it prints 'YES' if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This includes handling cases where `b - a` is negative or zero, ensuring that divisibility and the sign of the difference are considered.
