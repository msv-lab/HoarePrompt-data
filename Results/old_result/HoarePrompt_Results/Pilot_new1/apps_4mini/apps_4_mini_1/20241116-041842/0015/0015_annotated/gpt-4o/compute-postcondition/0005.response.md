The code prints the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to `a`, `c` is 0, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to `a`, `c` is 0, and the output is 'NO'**
