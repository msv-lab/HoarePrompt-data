The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b`, `c` is 0, and 'YES' is printed**
