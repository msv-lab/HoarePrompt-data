To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we first need to analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state.

1. The variable `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This means that `max_lemons` will hold the smallest value among these three calculations.
2. The code snippet calculates `total_fruits` using the formula:
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This simplifies to:
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
   ```

Now, since `max_lemons` is derived from the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state will reflect the values of these variables and the computed `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a positive integer input, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, and `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**
