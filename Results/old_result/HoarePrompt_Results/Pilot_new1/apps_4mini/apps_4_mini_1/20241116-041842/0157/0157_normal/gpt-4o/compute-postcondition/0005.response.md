The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The value of `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `total_fruits`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`), and `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, printed to the console.**
