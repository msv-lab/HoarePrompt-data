To calculate the output state, we first note that `max_lemons` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. The value of `max_lemons` will depend on the specific input values for `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

Next, we compute `total_fruits` using the formula provided: 

```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

This simplifies to:

```
total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
```

Now, since `max_lemons` is derived from the minimum of the three expressions, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
