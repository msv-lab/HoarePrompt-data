The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an input and convert it to an integer. The previous value of `c` is not known since it is being assigned a new value from input. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `c` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
