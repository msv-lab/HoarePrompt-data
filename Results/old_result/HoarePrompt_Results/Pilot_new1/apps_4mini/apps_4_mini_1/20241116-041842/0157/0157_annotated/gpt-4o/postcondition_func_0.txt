The function accepts three integers as input from the user representing quantities of different fruits. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made using these quantities, where each lemon requires 1 unit of the first fruit, 2 units of the second fruit, and 4 units of the third fruit. The total number of fruits produced is then printed, which is calculated based on the maximum number of lemons. The function does not return a value, but it prints the total number of fruits.
