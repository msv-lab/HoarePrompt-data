Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs from the user, which represent quantities of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be made, where each set consists of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It then computes the total number of fruits used in these sets and prints that total. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or zero, which could lead to incorrect or unexpected results. **
