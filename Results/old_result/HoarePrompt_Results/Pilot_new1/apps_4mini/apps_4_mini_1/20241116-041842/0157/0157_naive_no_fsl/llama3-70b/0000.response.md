Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of whole fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which is the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits:
   - For each lemon, 2 apples are needed, so the maximum lemons that can be supported by apples is `b // 2`.
   - For each lemon, 4 pears are needed, so the maximum lemons that can be supported by pears is `c // 4`.
   - The actual number of lemons that can be used is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7` (since 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears sum to 7 fruits).
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when there are not enough fruits to make even one complete set (in which case `min_lemon` will be 0 and the output will be 0). 

All provided examples in the problem description yield the expected results, confirming the correctness of the implementation. Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
