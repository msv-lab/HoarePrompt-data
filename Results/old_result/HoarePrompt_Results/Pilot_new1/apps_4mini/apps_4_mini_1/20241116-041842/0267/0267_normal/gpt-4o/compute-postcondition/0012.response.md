Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` such that `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is equal to `r` and `func_1(l, k)` returns false, then `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` is greater than `r` or if `l` and `r` are not within the bounds 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, the loop does not execute and `total_sum` remains 0.**
