Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is any integer from 1 to 10, the function does not return any value and the state of the program remains unchanged. If the tuple (n, k) exists in the dp structure, the function returns the associated value from dp[n, k]. Otherwise, the function does not return any value and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
