The function accepts an integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns True if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `k` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior since the concept of unique digits does not apply in that context.
