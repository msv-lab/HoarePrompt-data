The function accepts an integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns True if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where `k` is negative, but since the function logic inherently checks the number of unique digits against `k`, it is assumed that `k` should be non-negative for meaningful comparisons.
