Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains unchanged.***
