Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of 9, and additional calculations are performed to update `dp[n, k]` based on the range defined by `k`. In either case, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
