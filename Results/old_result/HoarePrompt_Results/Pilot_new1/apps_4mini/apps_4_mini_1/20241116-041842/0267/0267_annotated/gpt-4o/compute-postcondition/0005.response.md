According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` would be equal to `r`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `num` must be incremented, which means `r` must be adjusted to allow for another iteration. Since `num` is currently `r`, for the loop to execute again, `r` must be incremented by 1 to `r + 1`.

Additionally, since `l` must always be less than or equal to `r`, we need to ensure that `l` remains within the bounds. Therefore, we can keep `l` the same, as it is already valid.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is initially 0, `r` is updated to `r + 1`**
