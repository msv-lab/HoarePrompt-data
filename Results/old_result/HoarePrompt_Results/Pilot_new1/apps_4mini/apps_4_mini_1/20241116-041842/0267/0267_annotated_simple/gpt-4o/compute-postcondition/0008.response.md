According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` inclusive, which means it will execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to `l + 2`. Additionally, since `num` must not exceed `r`, we need to ensure that `l + 2` is still less than or equal to `r`.

Since `k` is within the range of 1 to 10 and does not affect the loop's ability to execute again, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` should be updated to `l + 2`.

We do not have any constraints on `l` and `r` that would prevent `num` from being equal to `l + 2`, so we can conclude:

State: **`l`, `r`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0 initially, and `num` is equal to `l + 2`**.
