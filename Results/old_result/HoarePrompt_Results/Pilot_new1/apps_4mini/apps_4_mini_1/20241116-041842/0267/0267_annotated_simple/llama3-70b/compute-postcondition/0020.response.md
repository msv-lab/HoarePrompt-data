Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the tuple (n, k) exists in the data structure `dp`, the function returns the value associated with that tuple. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is updated based on a calculation involving the number of digits and the modulo operation with `MOD`, while the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. All values of `dp[n, k]` are computed under the constraints of the given integers.***
