Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10^18 and greater than the previous `r`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is updated to (0 + `num`) % MOD, where `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns False, `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0.***
