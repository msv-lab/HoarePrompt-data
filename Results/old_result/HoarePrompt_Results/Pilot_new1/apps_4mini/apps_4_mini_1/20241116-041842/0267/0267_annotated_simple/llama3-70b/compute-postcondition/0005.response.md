Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the tuple (n, k) exists in the data structure dp, the function returns the value associated with that tuple. If (n, k) is not in dp, the function does not return a value.***
