According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, this condition is already satisfied. 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take on the value of `l`, which is the first number in the range. The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `l` is set appropriately within the specified bounds, and `num` should be initialized to `l`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
