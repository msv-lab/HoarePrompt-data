Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` equals `r`, the loop executes once, and `total_sum` is updated only if `func_1(l, k)` returns true; otherwise, it remains 0.**
