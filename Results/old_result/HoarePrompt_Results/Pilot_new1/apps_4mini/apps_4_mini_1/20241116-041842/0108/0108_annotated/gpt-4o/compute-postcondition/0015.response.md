The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables `s` and `target` remain unchanged, and the condition about `j` is dependent on previous comparisons which are not specified here. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and `target` is unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and `target` is unchanged**
