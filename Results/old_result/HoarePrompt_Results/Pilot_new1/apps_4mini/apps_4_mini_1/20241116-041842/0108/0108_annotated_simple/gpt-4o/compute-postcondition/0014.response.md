Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being either 1 or 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `target[j]`, `j` remains unchanged and is still either 0 or 1, while `i` remains less than `len(s) - 1.***
