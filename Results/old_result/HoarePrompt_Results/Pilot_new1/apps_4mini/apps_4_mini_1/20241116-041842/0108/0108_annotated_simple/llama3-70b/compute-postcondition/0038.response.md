Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of each character from `s` repeated based on its occurrences, with each occurrence replaced in `s` by the next character in ASCII order. The length of `res` is equal to 26, indicating that all characters from `alphabet` have been processed. `s` remains unchanged and may contain characters outside of `alphabet` or be empty.***
