Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to replace characters in the string `s` to form a string that contains the entire English alphabet as a subsequence. 

For example, consider the input string:

```
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy"
```

In this case, the string `s` already contains all the letters of the alphabet except for 'z'. According to the problem description, we can replace characters to achieve the target string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". However, the program does not account for the necessity of making replacements; it only checks for the presence of the characters in order.

The program will output `-1` for this input, even though it is possible to replace the last character 'y' with 'z' to achieve the target. This shows that the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, as it does not consider the potential to modify characters to achieve the subsequence of the alphabet. 

Thus, the program is incorrect.
