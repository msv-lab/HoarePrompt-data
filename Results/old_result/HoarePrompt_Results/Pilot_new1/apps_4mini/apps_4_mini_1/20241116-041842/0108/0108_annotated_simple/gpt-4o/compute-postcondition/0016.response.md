According to the code, the loop can execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, which means the current value of `i` is now one more than its value at the start of this iteration. Since `s` is a string with a length greater than 1, `len(s)` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)`, which implies that `i` must be less than 2.

Additionally, `j` can be 0, 1, or 2, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must also be less than `target_len`. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `target_len`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states as follows:
1. For `i` to be less than `len(s)`, we need to set `i` to a value less than the length of `s` (which is at least 2).
2. We need to ensure that `j` is less than `target_len`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `i` is less than len(s), `j` is less than target_len**
