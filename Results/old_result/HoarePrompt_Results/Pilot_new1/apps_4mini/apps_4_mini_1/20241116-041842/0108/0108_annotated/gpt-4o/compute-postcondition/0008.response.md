According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `target_len` is 26. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `s`, which is not specified, but we know `s` must have a length greater than 1 for `i` to be valid. 

Since `j` can be either 0 or 1, it is already less than `target_len`, which is 26, so it does not need adjustment. 

The only condition that needs to be ensured is that `i` remains less than the length of `s`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the length of `s` is greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and the length of `s` is greater than 1**
