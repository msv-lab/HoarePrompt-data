The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The variables `s` and `res` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect their values or state. Therefore, the output state is that `s` remains unchanged and contains only characters that are not in the alphabet or is empty, `res` is empty, and `res` does not contain all occurrences of characters from 'a' to 'z', along with the printed output of `-1`.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged and contains only characters that are not in the alphabet or is empty, `res` is empty, and `res` does not contain all occurrences of characters from 'a' to 'z'; printed output is -1**
