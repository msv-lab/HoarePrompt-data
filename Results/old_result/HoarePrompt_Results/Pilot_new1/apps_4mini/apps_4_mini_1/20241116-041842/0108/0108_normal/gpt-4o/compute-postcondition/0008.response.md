According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `target` has a length of 26 (`target_len` is 26), we need to ensure that `j` is still less than 26 for the loop to execute again.

Since we do not have information about the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration, we cannot determine if it needs to be adjusted. However, we do know that `i` is currently 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain less than the length of `s`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can run again, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1**
