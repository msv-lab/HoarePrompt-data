The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string. The previous values of the affected variables are `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and `alphabet`, which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The initialization of `res` does not affect the values of `s` or `alphabet`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `res`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is an empty string**
