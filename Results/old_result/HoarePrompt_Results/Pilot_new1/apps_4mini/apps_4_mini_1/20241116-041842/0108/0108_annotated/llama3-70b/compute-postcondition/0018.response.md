The code appends the value of `char` to the existing string `res`. The previous state of `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z', and `char` is a character present in `s`. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will include `char` in addition to its previous contents. The states of `s` and `char` are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` has had its first occurrence of 'z' replaced with '{'; `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z' plus `char`; `char` is a character present in `s`.**
