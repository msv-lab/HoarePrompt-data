The value of `res` is updated by appending the value of `char`, which is 'z'. The previous value of `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s`, and now 'z' is added to it. The variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains at least one 'a', `res` now contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z', and `char` is 'z'.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'a', `res` now contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z', `char` is 'z'**
