Output State: **`if s contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order then j` is 26 (equal to `target_len`), `i` is the length of `s`. If s is shorter than 26 characters or does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then `j` will be less than 26 and `i` will be the length of `s`. If s is empty, the loop will not execute and both `i` and `j` will remain 0.**
