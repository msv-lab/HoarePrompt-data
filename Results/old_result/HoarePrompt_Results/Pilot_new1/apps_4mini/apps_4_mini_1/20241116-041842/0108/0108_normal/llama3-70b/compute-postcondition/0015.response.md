The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `char`, which is the next character in `alphabet` after 'c'. However, the previous value of `res` is unknown, and we know that `char` is defined but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `res` while noting that `char` has a specific value that is not explicitly stated.

Output State: **`alphabet` contains characters after 'c', `char` is the next character in `alphabet` after 'c', and `res` is incremented by `char`.**
