The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. Since `char` is in `s` and `alphabet` has at least one more character, the state of `res` changes by adding `char` to its previous value. The states of the other variables (`alphabet` and `char`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `alphabet` has at least one more character, `char` is in `s`, and `res` is increased by `char`.

Output State: **`alphabet` has at least one more character, `char` is in `s`, and `res` is increased by `char`**
