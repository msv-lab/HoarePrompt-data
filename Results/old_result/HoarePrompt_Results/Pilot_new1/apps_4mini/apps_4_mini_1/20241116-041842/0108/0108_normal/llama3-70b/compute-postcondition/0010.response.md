The value of `res` is updated by adding `char`, which is 'b'. Since `res` is updated by appending 'b' to its previous value, the output state reflects this change. The initial state of `s` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 'b', `res` is updated by adding 'b' to its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is 'b', `res` is updated by adding 'b' to its previous value**
