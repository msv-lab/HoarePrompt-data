The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is not specified, but it will now contain all occurrences of `char` plus the newly added `char`. The value of `char` is the previous character in the alphabet that is in `s`, and since `s` currently includes `char`, the output state reflects that `res` now includes one additional occurrence of `char`. 

Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of `char` plus one additional occurrence of `char`, `char` is the previous character in the alphabet that is in `s`, and `s` currently includes `char`**
