The value of `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the expression `(a_floor - b_floor)` will yield a positive value. The previous values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are not specified, but the calculation will result in a value that is greater than 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the expression.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the expression.**
