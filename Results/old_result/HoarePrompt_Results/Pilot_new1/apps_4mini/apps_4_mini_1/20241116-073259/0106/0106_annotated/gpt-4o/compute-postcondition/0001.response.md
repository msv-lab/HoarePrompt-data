To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, where apartment is either a or b, and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.

The code snippet:
```
floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
```

Now, we break down the impact of the code:

1. The variable `apartment` can take on the values of either `a` or `b`.
2. The expression `(apartment - 1)` is computed, which means we subtract 1 from whichever value `apartment` holds.
3. We then take the modulus of that result with `(m * k)`, which gives us the value of `floor_within_block`.

Since `apartment` can be either `a` or `b`, the value of `floor_within_block` will depend on which value `apartment` takes. Therefore, the output state will reflect both possibilities.

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `floor_within_block` is either (a - 1) % (m * k) or (b - 1) % (m * k)**
