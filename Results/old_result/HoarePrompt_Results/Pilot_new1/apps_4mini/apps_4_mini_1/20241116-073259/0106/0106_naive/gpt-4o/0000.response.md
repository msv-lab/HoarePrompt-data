To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program carefully.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: 
   - `n`: Number of entrances
   - `m`: Number of floors per entrance
   - `k`: Number of apartments per floor
   - `a`: Apartment number where Edward lives
   - `b`: Apartment number where Natasha lives

2. **Apartment Numbering**:
   - Apartments are numbered sequentially from 1 to `n * m * k`.
   - Each entrance has `m * k` apartments.

3. **Movement Costs**:
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds per floor.
   - Moving between entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - Using the elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive, plus 1 second per floor.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha. It includes:
- A helper function `get_location` which determines the entrance (block) and floor of a given apartment number.
- The calculation of the time to exit Edward's entrance based on his floor.
- The calculation of walking time between entrances in both directions.
- The calculation of time to reach Natasha's floor after reaching her entrance.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Block Calculation**: 
   - The calculation for `block` seems correct, as it uses integer division and modulus to find which entrance the apartment belongs to.
   
2. **Floor Calculation**:
   - The calculation for `floor` also appears correct, as it divides the remaining apartments by `k`.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time to exit the entrance seems to be handled correctly, but if Edward is on the first floor, he does not need to use the elevator.
   - The walking time calculation uses the modulus operator, which is correct for wrapping around the entrances.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not seem to account for the case where both apartments are on the same floor in different entrances. In this scenario, Edward might not need to go to the first floor at all and could just walk to Natasha's entrance.
   - The elevator usage is only considered if Edward is above the first floor, but it may be more optimal to walk directly if both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor.

### Example Case:
Consider the case where:
- `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 5`
- `a = 5` (Edward's apartment), `b = 1` (Natasha's apartment)

In this case:
- Edward is in entrance 1 on floor 1, and Natasha is in entrance 1 on floor 1.
- The optimal time should be 0 seconds since they are at the same entrance and floor.

However, due to the way the program calculates time, it may incorrectly compute the time required when both are on the same floor in the same entrance.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the scenario where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor in the same entrance correctly. Thus, it can yield incorrect results for such cases.

Correctness: **False**.
