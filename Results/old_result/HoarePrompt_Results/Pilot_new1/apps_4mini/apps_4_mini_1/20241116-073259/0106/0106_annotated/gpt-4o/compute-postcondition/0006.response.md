Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are the results of `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, then `time_to_exit` is 9 plus the value of `floor_a`.***
