The function accepts no parameters directly but reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to move between two blocks and floors based on the input values, considering both the block difference and the floor difference. The output is the sum of the minimum block transition time and the minimum floor transition time, which accounts for the time taken to move between floors. The function does not handle invalid input scenarios or provide feedback if inputs are out of expected ranges.
