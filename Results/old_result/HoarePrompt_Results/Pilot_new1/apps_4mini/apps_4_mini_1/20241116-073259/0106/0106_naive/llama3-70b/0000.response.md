To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of entrances (`n`), floors per entrance (`m`), and apartments per floor (`k`). It also reads the apartment numbers (`a` and `b`) where Edward and Natasha live.

2. **Floor and Entrance Calculation**:
   - It calculates the floor of Edward's apartment `a` using `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
   - It calculates the entrance (block) of Edward's apartment using `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
   - It does the same for Natasha's apartment `b`.

3. **Block Time Calculation**:
   - It calculates the time to move between blocks (entrances) using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. This is correct as it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise movements around the circular building.

4. **Floor Time Calculation**:
   - The program checks if Edward is on a higher floor than Natasha. If so, it calculates the time to descend using `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. However, this calculation has a flaw because it assumes that Edward will always take the lift to the first floor before moving to Natasha's floor, which may not be optimal in all cases.
   - If Edward is on a lower floor, it calculates the time to ascend similarly.

5. **Final Output**: The program sums the block time and floor time and prints the result.

### Potential Case for Incorrectness:
Consider the following scenario:
- Let `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 5`.
- Edward is in apartment `a = 5` (which is on floor 1 of entrance 1).
- Natasha is in apartment `b = 6` (which is on floor 1 of entrance 2).

According to the code:
- Edward's calculations would yield `a_floor = 1`, `a_block = 1`.
- Natasha's calculations would yield `b_floor = 1`, `b_block = 2`.

The block time will be `15 seconds` (moving from entrance 1 to entrance 2). The floor time will be `0 seconds` (same floor). 

Total time calculated would be `15 seconds`, which is correct.

Now consider:
- Let `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 5`.
- Edward is in apartment `a = 10` (which is on floor 2 of entrance 2).
- Natasha is in apartment `b = 1` (which is on floor 1 of entrance 1).

According to the code:
- Edward's calculations would yield `a_floor = 2`, `a_block = 2`.
- Natasha's calculations would yield `b_floor = 1`, `b_block = 1`.

The block time will be `15 seconds` (moving from entrance 2 to entrance 1). The floor time will be `5 seconds` (going down one floor). 

Total time calculated would be `20 seconds`, which is correct.

However, the program does not consider the optimal use of the elevator, which could reduce the time in certain situations. For example, if Edward is on the top floor of an entrance and Natasha is on the bottom floor of the same entrance, it may be faster to take the elevator down instead of walking down the stairs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for all potential cases where the use of the elevator could lead to a shorter time than the staircase, particularly when moving between different floors in the same entrance. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
