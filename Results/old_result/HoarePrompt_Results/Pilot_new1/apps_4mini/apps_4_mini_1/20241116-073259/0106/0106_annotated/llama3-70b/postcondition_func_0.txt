The function accepts no parameters directly but reads four integers from input: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to travel between the floors represented by `a` and `b`, considering both the block time and the floor time. The block time is determined by the number of blocks between the two positions, while the floor time is based on the difference in their respective floors. The function prints the total time, which is the sum of the block time and the floor time. It assumes that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers within specified ranges.
