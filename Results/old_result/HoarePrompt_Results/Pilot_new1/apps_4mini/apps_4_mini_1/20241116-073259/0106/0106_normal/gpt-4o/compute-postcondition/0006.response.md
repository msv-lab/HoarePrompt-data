Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, `time_to_exit` is at least 11, calculated as 10 plus the number of floors above the first floor (i.e., `floor_a - 1`).***
