The function accepts five parameters: integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which define the dimensions of a building, and integers `a` and `b`, which represent specific locations within the building. It calculates the total time required to exit from location `a` to location `b`, considering the time to exit the current floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The total time is computed as the sum of the time to exit the current floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function does not account for cases where the location `b` is on the same floor as `a`, which would potentially simplify the walking time calculation.
