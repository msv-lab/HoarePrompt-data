The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but they will now be set to the values provided in the input. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are input positive integers; `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are input positive integers; `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input**
