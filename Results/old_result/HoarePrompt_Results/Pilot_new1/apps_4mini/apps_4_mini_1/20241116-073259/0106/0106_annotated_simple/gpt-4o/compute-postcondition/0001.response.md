The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The initial state indicates that `block` is a positive integer calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. However, the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `floor_within_block`. 

Thus, the output state is based on the calculation that `floor_within_block` is the remainder of `(apartment - 1)` divided by the product of `m` and `k`. The state of the variable `block` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`block` is a positive integer calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
