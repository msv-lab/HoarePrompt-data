To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze its logic step by step against the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Apartment Layout**:
   - The apartments are organized in a circular building with `n` blocks (entrances), `m` floors per block, and `k` apartments per floor.
   - The total number of apartments is `n * m * k`.

2. **Finding the Location of Apartments**:
   - The function `get_location(apartment)` is designed to determine which block (entrance) and which floor the given apartment number is located in.
   - This logic seems correct, as it uses integer division and modulus to find the correct block and floor.

3. **Calculating Time to Exit**:
   - The time to exit from the apartment to the ground floor is calculated correctly. If Edward is on the first floor, the time is zero. Otherwise, he waits 10 seconds for the lift, plus 1 second for each floor he descends.

4. **Calculating Walking Time**:
   - The program calculates both direct and reverse walking times between the blocks, which is correct. It uses the modulus operator to handle the circular nature of the building.

5. **Calculating Time to Target Floor**:
   - The time to get to the target floor is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, which is correct, as it accounts for the time taken to climb floors.

6. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - The total time is the sum of the time to exit, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach the target floor.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case where Edward is already on the first floor**: The program handles this correctly by setting `time_to_exit` to 0.
- **Case where both apartments are on the same floor**: The walking time should be calculated correctly based on the blocks.
- **Case where `a` and `b` represent apartments in different blocks and floors**: The program calculates the time correctly based on the given rules.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It accounts for all necessary factors, including the circular layout, the time taken to use the lift, and walking times between entrances.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected given the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
