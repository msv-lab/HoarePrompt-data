Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as two distinct integers `a` and `b`, which represent locations in a multi-block building. It calculates the total time required to exit from the floor of location `a` to the floor of location `b`. This total time is computed by considering the time to exit the current floor, the minimum walking time between blocks (either direct or reverse), and the time to reach the target floor. The function returns this total time. **
