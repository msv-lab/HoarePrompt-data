The code calculates `floor_within_block` as the remainder of the division of `(apartment - 1)` by `(m * k)`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `apartment` is an integer within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. The value of `floor_within_block` is determined by the specific value of `apartment`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `floor_within_block` is calculated but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing `apartment`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
