The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on user input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their previous values, while `a` and `b` are now distinct integers within the range specified (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` as user inputs.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` retain their previous values; `a` and `b` are distinct integers based on user input.**
