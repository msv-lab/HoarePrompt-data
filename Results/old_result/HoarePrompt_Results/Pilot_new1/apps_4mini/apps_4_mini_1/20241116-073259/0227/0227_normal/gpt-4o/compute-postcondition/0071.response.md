Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It sorts the list and iteratively checks which elements cannot be represented as the difference between any two previously processed elements. The function returns the count of such elements, represented by the variable `m`. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 since the only element cannot be formed by any difference. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0, which could lead to an error when accessing `a[0]`. **
