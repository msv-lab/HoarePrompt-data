Output State: **`m` is equal to the count of elements in `a` that are not double the previous element, excluding the first element. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `m` remains 1. If `n` is at least 2, the loop executes `n-1` times, and `m` is incremented for each element in `a` that does not satisfy the condition `a[i] == a[i - 1] * 2`.**
