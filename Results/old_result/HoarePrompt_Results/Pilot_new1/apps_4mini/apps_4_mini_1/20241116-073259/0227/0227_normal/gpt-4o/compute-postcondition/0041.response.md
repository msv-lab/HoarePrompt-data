Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such `x` exists, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False, `m` is unchanged, and `i` is 2.**
