Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing without breaking.***
