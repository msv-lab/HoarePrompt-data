The value of `can_form` is explicitly set to `True`. Since it was already set to True or remains unchanged, the value does not change. The other variables (`n`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `x` is the second element in `assigned`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `x` is the second element in `assigned**
