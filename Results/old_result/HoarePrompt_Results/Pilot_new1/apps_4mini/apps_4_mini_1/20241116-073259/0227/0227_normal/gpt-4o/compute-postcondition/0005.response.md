The value of `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element a[0], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element a[0], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False**
