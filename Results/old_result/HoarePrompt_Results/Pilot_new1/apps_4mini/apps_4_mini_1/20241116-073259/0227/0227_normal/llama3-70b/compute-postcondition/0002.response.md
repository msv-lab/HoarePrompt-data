The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` indicates the number of distinct positive integers in the list `a`, but the specific values of these integers are not provided. Therefore, after executing the sorting operation, the output state reflects that `a` is now sorted. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers**
