According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and given that the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and since the loop starts at 1, `i` will be initialized to 1 before the loop starts. 

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
