Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, and `m` remains unchanged unless `a[n]` is not equal to `a[n - 1] * 2`, in which case `m` is incremented by 1. This covers the scenario where the last element of the list does not satisfy the doubling condition compared to the second last element, while all other conditions regarding the distinctness and ordering of elements in `a` remain intact.***
