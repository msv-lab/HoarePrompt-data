Postcondition: ***`assigned` includes `a[1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is `a[1]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, and no changes occur to the other variables.***
