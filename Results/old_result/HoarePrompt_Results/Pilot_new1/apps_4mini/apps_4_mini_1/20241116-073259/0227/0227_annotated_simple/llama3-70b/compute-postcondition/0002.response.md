The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. After executing the sorting operation, the order of the elements in `a` will change to reflect their sorted arrangement, but the specific values of `a` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` has been sorted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers**
