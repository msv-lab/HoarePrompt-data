Postcondition: ***`assigned` is a non-empty list, `i` is 3, and if the value of `(a[3] - x)` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `(a[3] - x)` does not exist in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains unchanged.***
