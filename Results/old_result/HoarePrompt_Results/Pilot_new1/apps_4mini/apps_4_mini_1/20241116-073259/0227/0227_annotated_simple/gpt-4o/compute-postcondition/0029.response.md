The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, changing its previous value from `False`. The other variables (`assigned`, `i`, `n`, and the difference condition) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `assigned` includes `a[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the difference between `a[1]` and `x` is an element of `assigned**
