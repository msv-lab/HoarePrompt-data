Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False initially, but if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` becomes True, indicating that a valid combination can be formed. The variable `i` remains equal to 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `assigned` continues to contain at least 2 elements. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False.***
