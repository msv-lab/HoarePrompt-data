Output State: **If `assigned` contains at least one element such that the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` will be set to True. If `assigned` is empty or does not contain any element that satisfies the condition, then `can_form` remains False. If the loop does not execute (when `assigned` is empty), `can_form` is False, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `assigned` remains unchanged.**
