Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1, while `i` remains 2 and `m` unchanged. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is still 2, and no modifications occur. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` is False, resulting in `m` being increased by 1, with `i` remaining 2.***
