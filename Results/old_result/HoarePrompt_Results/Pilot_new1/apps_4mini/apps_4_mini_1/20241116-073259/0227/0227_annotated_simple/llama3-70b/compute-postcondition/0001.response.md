The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes a space-separated input of integers, converts each to an integer, and stores them in a list. The value of `n` indicates the number of integers that will be inputted into the list `a`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23, the list `a` will contain exactly `n` distinct integers.

The output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of `n` distinct integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on input.**
