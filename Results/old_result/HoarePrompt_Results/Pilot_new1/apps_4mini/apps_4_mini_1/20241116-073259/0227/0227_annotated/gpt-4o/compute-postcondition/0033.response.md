The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and the state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` includes `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `m` is unchanged, `x` is `a[0]`, and `can_form` is True.
