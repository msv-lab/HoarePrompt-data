The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` includes `a[1]`, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `x` is `a[1]`, `can_form` is now True, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
