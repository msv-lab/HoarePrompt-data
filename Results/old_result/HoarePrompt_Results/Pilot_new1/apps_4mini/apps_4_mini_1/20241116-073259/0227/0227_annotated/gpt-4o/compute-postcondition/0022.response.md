The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is the number of elements in `assigned`, which is not specified but can be any integer based on the context. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `assigned`, `x`, and `can_form`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the elements checked, `m` is now one more than its previous value, `x` is the last element checked from `assigned`, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the elements checked, `m` is now one more than its previous value, `x` is the last element checked from `assigned`, and `can_form` is False**.
