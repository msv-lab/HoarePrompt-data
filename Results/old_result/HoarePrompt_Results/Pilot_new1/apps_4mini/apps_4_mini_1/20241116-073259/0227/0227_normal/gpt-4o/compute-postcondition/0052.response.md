Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[3]`), `n` is greater than 3, if the value of `a[3] - x` is an element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is exited. If `a[3] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False.***
