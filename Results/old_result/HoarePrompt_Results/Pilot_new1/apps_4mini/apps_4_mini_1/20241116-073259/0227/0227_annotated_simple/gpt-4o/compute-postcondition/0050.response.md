The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`. The other variables `assigned`, `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` includes `a[1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[1]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`.

Output State: **`assigned` includes `a[1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[1]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`**
