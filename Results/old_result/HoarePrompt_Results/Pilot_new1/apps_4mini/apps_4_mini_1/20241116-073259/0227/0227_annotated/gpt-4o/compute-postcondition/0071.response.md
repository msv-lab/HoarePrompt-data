Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It returns the count of distinct elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements. If `n` is 1, it will always return 1, as there are no two elements to sum. The function processes the list by sorting it and maintaining a set of assigned elements, incrementing the count `m` whenever an element cannot be expressed as the sum of any two previously assigned elements. **
