The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than `n`, the function executes a loop `k` times, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each integer `i` from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, and if `k` is at least 1, the set of seen remainders will contain unique remainders from these divisions.
- In Case 3, if none of the previous conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the values of `k` in relation to `n`, it may return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if duplicate remainders are found during the calculations. If no such conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if duplicate remainders are found during calculations; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.**
