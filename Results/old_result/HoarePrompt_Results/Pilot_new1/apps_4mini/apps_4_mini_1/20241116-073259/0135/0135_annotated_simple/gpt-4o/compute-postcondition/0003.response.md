The code initializes an empty set `seen_remainders`. The previous values of the affected variables `n` and `k` are not directly impacted by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `seen_remainders` while keeping the values of `n` and `k` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
