Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'; otherwise, there is no action taken and the state remains unchanged with respect to `seen_remainders`, `i`, and `remainder`.***
