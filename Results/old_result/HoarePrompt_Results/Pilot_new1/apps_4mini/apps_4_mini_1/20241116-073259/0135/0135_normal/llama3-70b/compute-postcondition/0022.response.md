Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute k times, calculating the remainder of n divided by each i from 1 to k, and storing each unique remainder in the set seen. If any remainder is found in seen during the loop, it will print 'No' and exit. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and seen remains an empty set.**
