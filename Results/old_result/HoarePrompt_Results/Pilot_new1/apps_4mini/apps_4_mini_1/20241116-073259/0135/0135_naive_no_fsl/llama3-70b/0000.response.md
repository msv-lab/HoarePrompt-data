To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic against the requirements.

The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, and checks if the remainders of `n` divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. It uses a set to track seen remainders and exits early if it finds a duplicate.

### Key Observations:
1. **Remainders Calculation**: The remainders are calculated using `n % i` for `i` in the range from `1` to `k`.
2. **Distinct Check**: The program checks if a remainder has already been seen by using a set. If it finds a duplicate, it prints "No" and exits.
3. **Output**: If no duplicates are found, it prints "Yes".

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the remainder is `1 % 1 = 0`, which is distinct (only one value).
2. **Large Values**: For `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`, the program should handle large inputs efficiently.
3. **Duplicate Remainders**: For cases where `n` is less than `k`, such as `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the remainders will be `0, 1, 0, 2, 2` (for `i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`), which will produce duplicates.

### Testing an Edge Case:
Let's consider `n = 4` and `k = 4`:
- Remainders would be:
  - `4 % 1 = 0`
  - `4 % 2 = 0`
  - `4 % 3 = 1`
  - `4 % 4 = 0`
  
Here, we see that the remainders `0` appears multiple times. The program correctly identifies this and outputs "No".

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic of the program and considering various edge cases, it seems that the program works correctly for all tested scenarios. It efficiently checks for distinct remainders and handles the input size constraints.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately identifies whether all remainders are distinct for the given range of integers based on the logic provided in the problem description.
