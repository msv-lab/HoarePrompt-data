The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and checks if the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from `1` to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, it skips the loop and directly prints 'Yes' since no remainders can be checked.
