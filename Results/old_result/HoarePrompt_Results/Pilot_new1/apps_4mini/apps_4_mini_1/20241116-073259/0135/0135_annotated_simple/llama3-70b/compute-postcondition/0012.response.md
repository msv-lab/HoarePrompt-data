The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. It does not change the values of any variables, but it indicates that the program will stop executing further. The output state reflects that the program has been terminated without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is now `n % 2`, and the program has exited.**
