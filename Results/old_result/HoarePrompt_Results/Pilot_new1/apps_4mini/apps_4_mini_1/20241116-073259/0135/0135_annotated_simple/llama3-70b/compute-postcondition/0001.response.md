The variable `seen` is assigned an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were input integers. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `seen` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `seen` is an empty set**
