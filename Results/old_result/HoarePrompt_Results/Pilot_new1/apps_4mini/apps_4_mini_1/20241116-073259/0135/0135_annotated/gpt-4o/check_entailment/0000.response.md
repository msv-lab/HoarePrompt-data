To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description, along with the annotations.

### Problem Description
The task is to check if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`.

### Code Analysis
The code performs the following steps:
1. It checks if `k >= n`. If this condition is true, it immediately returns 'No'. This is based on the reasoning that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the remainders `n % i` for `i = n` will be `0`, which will repeat for any `i` greater than `n` (since `n % n = 0`).
2. If `k < n`, it initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders encountered.
3. It then iterates through all integers from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i` and checking if this remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns 'No'.
4. If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'.

### Annotations Review
The annotations provide a summary of the code's functionality and state:
- They confirm that if `k >= n`, the function returns 'No'.
- They indicate that if any remainder is repeated during the loop, the function returns 'No', otherwise it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases
1. **Case when `k = n`:** According to the code, it returns 'No' because `k` is not less than `n`. This is correct as `n % n = 0` will repeat for `i = n`.
2. **Case when `k < n`:**
   - For small values of `k`, the function checks all values from `1` to `k`. If `k` is small enough compared to `n`, it should correctly identify distinct remainders.
   - However, if `k` is greater than `n/2`, we will start seeing repetitions in the remainders because `n % i` for `i > n/2` will start repeating values from `1` to `n/2`. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 8`, the remainders for `i = 6, 7, 8` will be `4, 3, 2` respectively, which are distinct, but if `k = 10`, `n % 10 = 0` will repeat with `n % 5 = 0`.

### Conclusion
The code does not handle cases correctly when `k` is greater than `n/2`. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 10`, it will return 'No' because `10 % 10 = 0` and `10 % 5 = 0`, which are not distinct. However, the case where `k = 10` should return 'No' for a different reason (not just because `k >= n`).

Thus, the program does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
