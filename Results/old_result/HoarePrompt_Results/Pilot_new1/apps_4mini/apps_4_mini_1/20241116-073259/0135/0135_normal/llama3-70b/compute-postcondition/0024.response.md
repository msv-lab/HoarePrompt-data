The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the constraints provided, `n` and `k` are integers with values ranging from 1 to \(10^{18}\). However, since there are no parameters defined in the function signature, it implies that the function operates without direct input. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be clearly defined without additional information regarding its behavior or output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its output is not specified.**
