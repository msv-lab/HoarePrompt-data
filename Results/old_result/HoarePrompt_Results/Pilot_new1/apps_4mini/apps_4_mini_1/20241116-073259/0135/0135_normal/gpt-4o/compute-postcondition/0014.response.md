Output State: **`seen_remainders` contains the unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop executes up to `k` times, and `remainder` will be the unique remainders calculated during each iteration. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If a `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders` during any iteration, the function will return 'No'.**
