The code initializes `seen_remainders` as an empty set. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code. The program does not return any value at this point, and the state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
