To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the requirements:

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to check if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. This means for any pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, it should hold that `n % i != n % j`.

### Given Program:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The program uses a set `seen` to track the remainders of `n` modulo `i` as `i` ranges from `1` to `k`.
2. For each `i`, it calculates the remainder `n % i`.
3. If the remainder has already been seen (exists in the set), it prints 'No' and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
4. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum values**: When `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be 'Yes' since `1 % 1 = 0` and there's no other `i` to compare.
2. **Large values**: When `n` and `k` are very large, e.g., `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`, the program should handle this without performance issues.
3. **Remainders that should be the same**: For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders would be:
   - `4 % 1 = 0`
   - `4 % 2 = 0`
   - `4 % 3 = 1`
   - `4 % 4 = 0`
   Here, `0` appears multiple times, so the output should be 'No'.
4. **Distinct remainders**: For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the remainders are:
   - `5 % 1 = 0`
   - `5 % 2 = 1`
   - `5 % 3 = 2`
   All are distinct, so the output should be 'Yes'.

### Potential Issue:
The program fails to account for the fact that for any `k >= n`, the remainders will start repeating. For instance, if `n = 10` and `k = 10`, the values of `n % i` for `i` from `1` to `10` will include duplicates (e.g., `10 % 1 = 0`, `10 % 2 = 0`, `10 % 5 = 0`, etc.). Therefore, the program will incorrectly return 'Yes' for cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle cases where `k >= n`, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
