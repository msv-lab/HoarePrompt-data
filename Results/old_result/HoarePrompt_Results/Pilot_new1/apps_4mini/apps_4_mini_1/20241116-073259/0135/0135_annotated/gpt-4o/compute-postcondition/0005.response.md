The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression `n % 1` will always yield 0, regardless of the value of `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0**
