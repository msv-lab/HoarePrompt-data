The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are modified or returned, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has exited without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the program has exited.**
