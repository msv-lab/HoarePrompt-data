The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is `n % 3`, and 'No' is printed.**
