The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input. The function then computes the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. It keeps track of these remainders in a set called `seen`. If a remainder is found in `seen` during the loop, it prints 'No' and exits the function immediately, indicating that a duplicate remainder has been found. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints 'Yes'.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `k` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and 'Yes' will be printed, implying that there are no remainders to compare.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values), which could lead to runtime errors.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, checks for duplicate remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and prints 'No' if a duplicate is found and 'Yes' otherwise. If `k` is less than 1, it prints 'Yes' without performing any checks. **
