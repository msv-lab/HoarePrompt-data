The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input. It initializes an empty set called `seen` to track the remainders of `n` when divided by integers from 1 to `k`. The function iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, and checks if this remainder has already been encountered (i.e., if it exists in the `seen` set). If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits the function immediately. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints 'Yes'.

The function does not accept any parameters and relies on user input for its execution. It effectively checks for uniqueness of the remainders obtained from dividing `n` by each integer from 1 to `k`. Notably, if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the function will directly print 'Yes' since no remainders can be checked.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, checks for duplicate remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and prints 'No' if any duplicates are found; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, it directly prints 'Yes'. **
