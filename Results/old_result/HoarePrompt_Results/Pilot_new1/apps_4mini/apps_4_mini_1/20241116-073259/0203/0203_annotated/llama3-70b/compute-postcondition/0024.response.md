Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and `n` is the length of `fractions`. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the function prints 'D'. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the function prints 'R'. In the case where `n` is 0, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are 0, and 'R' is printed.***
