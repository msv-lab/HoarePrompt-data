The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from `r_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. This means that `r_queue` will be modified to no longer include the first element, and `r_index` will now hold that value. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` is either empty or contains indices of 'D' characters; `r_queue` is modified to exclude the first element; `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is either empty or contains indices of 'D' characters; `r_queue` is modified to exclude the first element; `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`**
