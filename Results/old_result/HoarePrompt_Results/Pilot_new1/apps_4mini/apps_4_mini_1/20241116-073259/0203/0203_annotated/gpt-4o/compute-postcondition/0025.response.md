The code appends the value `r_index + n` to the `r_queue`. The previous state of `r_queue` could be either empty or contain indices, but the specific values are not provided. The variable `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` is some integer value. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change in `r_queue` with the new value appended.

Output State: **`d_queue` is either empty or contains indices of 'D' characters; `r_queue` is modified to include `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`; `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
