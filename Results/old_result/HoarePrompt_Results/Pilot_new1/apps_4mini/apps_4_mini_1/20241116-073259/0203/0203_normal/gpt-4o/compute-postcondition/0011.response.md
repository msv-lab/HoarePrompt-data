The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 1, and the state of the other variables (`n`, `votes`, and `v`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` has been added to `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character of `votes`, and `d_queue` now contains the value 1.**
