The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and the parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the count of 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the string.**
