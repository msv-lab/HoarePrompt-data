Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is non-empty, `r_queue` can be either empty or non-empty, and both queues contain indices updated by `n` for the remaining elements not processed. If `d_queue` is processed, it will contain indices of 'D' votes, and if `r_queue` is processed, it will contain indices of non-'D' votes. If `votes` is empty, both queues remain unchanged.***
