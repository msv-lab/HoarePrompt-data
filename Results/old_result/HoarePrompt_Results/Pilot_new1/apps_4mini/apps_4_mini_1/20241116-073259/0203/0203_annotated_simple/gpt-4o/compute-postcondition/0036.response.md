The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is not specified in the initial state. The code appends the value `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The value of `r_queue` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged `r_queue` and the updated `d_queue` with the new element added.

Output State: **`d_queue` is updated with `d_index + n`, `r_queue` is non-empty after removing the first element, `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.**
