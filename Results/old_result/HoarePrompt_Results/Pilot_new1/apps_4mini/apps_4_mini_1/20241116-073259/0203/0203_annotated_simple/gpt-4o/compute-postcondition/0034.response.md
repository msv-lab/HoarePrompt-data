The operation `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` is non-empty, this operation will succeed, and `d_index` will hold the value of the first element of `d_queue`. The `d_queue` will then be one element shorter, but the specific contents of `d_queue` are not known. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty, `r_queue` is non-empty, and `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`**
