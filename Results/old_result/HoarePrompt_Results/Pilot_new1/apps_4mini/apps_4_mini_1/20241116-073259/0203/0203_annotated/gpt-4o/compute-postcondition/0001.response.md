The variable `votes` is assigned the value obtained from `input()`, which is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`. The initial state of `n` is not affected by this operation, as `votes` is a separate variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` and the newly assigned value of `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the input string with whitespace stripped**
