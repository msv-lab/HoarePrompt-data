The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, but the actual value of `n` is determined by user input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
