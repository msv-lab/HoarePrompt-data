The code removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The variable `d_queue` remains unchanged, as it has one less element, and `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`. The state of `r_queue` will change as it will now have one less element after the pop operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_queue` is not empty, and `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
