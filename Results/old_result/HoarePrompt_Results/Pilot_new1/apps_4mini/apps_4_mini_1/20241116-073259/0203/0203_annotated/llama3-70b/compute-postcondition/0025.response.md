The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, it returns a value based on the relationships defined between the characters in the `fractions` string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` containing characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a value based on the processing of these inputs.**
