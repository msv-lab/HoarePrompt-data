The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` is non-empty, this operation will succeed, and the first element will no longer be in `r_queue`. The value of `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty, `r_queue` is non-empty after removing the first element, `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.**
