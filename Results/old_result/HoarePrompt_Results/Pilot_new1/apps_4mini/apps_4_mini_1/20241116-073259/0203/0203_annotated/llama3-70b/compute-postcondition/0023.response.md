The code prints the character 'R'. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by the print statement, and since `depublicans` and `remocrats` are both 0, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, and the character 'R' is printed.

Output State: **`depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, and 'R' is printed**
