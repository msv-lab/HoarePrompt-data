Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string; if the first character `v` of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the index 0, and `r_queue` remains empty. If `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` remains empty, and `r_queue` contains the index 0. In either case, `i` is 0.***
