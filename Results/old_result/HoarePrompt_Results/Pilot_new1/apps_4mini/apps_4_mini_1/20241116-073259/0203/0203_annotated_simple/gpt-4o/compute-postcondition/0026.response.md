Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is updated by appending `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `d_queue` is updated by removing the first element, and `r_queue` is updated by appending `r_index + n`. After executing the program fragment, `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` following the pop operation, regardless of the condition.***
