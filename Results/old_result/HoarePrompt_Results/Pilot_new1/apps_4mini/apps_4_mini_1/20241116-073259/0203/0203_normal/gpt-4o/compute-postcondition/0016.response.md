The code appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The value of `i` is 2, and since the initial state does not mention `r_queue`, we assume it is either empty or not defined before this operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`; `r_queue` now contains the value 2.
