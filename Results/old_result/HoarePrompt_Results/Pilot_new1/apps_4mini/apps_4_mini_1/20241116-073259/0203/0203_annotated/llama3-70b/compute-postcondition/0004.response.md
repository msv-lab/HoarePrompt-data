According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will execute for each character in the `fractions` string. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, indicating that the string has at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have processed all characters in `fractions`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, `fraction` should be the first character of the `fractions` string, and the initial values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are still 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
