The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, but the exact value of `n` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000**
