The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` will have a value between 2 and 200,001. The other variables, `votes` and `v`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `n + 1`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is the character at index `n` in `votes` (undefined); and `d_queue` now contains `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `n + 1`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is the character at index `n` in `votes` (undefined); `d_queue` now contains `i`.**
