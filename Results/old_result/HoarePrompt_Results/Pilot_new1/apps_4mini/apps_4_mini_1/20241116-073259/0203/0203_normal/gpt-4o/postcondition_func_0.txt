The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a non-empty string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the votes by iterating through their indices and maintains two queues: one for 'D' votes and another for 'R' votes. The function continues to compare the indices of the votes from both queues, appending the index of the processed vote plus `n` back into its respective queue until one of the queues is empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if there are remaining 'D' votes, or 'R' if there are no 'D' votes left, indicating the winner based on the remaining votes. The function does not handle the case where the input string is empty, which could lead to an error if not addressed.
