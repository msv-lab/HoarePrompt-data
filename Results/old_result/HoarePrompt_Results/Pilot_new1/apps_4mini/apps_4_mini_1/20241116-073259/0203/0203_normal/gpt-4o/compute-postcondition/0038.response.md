Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has at least 1 element less than before, and if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one more element with the value of `d_index + n` appended. Otherwise, `r_queue` has one more element with the value of `r_index + n` appended, and `r_index` remains the value of the removed element from `r_queue`. In either case, `r_queue` has one less element than before.***
