The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that falls within the range of 1 to 200,000. The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting solely of the characters 'D' and 'R'. The output of the function is determined by the contents of the `fractions` string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It processes these inputs to produce a specific output based on the characters in `fractions`.**
