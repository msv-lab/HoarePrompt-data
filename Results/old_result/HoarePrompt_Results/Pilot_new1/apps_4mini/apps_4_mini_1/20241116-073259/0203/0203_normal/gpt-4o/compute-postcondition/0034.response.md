The value of `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`, which is removed from the queue due to the `pop(0)` operation. Since `d_queue` has at least one element, this operation is valid and will result in `d_queue` having one less element. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has at least 1 element (now it has one less), `r_queue` has at least 1 element, and `d_index` is the value of the removed element from `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element (now it has one less), `r_queue` has at least 1 element, and `d_index` is the value of the removed element from `d_queue`**
