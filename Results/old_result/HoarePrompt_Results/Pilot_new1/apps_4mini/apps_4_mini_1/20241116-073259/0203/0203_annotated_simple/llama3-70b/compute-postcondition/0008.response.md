The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is 0, so after execution, `remocrats` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1**
