Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least one element, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x`, `results`, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged. If the difference between `x` and the first element `b` of `prefix_balances` is non-negative and divisible by `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the condition is not met, `count` remains 0.***
