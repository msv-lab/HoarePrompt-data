The values of `n` and `x` are assigned from the input, where `input().split()` splits the input string into two parts and `map(int, ...)` converts them into integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `n` and `x`, so they will be set to the input integers provided at runtime. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `x` are now input integers.

Output State: **`T` is 100; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
