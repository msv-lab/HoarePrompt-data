The code uses the `print` function to output the value of `result`. Since `results` contains -1, the output will be -1. The other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, and the function prints -1**
