Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is either 1 if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true, or remains 0 if these conditions do not hold. The variable `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and `index` is 0.***
