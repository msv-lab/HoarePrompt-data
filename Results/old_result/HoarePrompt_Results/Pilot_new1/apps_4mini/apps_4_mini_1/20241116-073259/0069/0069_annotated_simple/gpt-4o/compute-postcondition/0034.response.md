Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being either 2 (if it was initially 1) or remaining at 1 (if it was already 2). If the conditions do not hold, `count` remains unchanged at either 1 or 0.***
