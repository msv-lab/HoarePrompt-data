Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains cumulative values based on the characters in `s`, if `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1; if `x` is not present, `results` includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true, and `results` includes this `count`. The values of `x`, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged regardless of the conditions.***
