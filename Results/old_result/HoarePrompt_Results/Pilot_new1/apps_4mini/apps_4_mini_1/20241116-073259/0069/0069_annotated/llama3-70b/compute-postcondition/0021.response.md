The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1`, but it does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 99`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints `-1`.
