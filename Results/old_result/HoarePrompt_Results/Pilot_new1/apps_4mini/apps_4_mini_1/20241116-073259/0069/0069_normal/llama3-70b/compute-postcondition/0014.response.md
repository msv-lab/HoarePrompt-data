Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5). If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the number of adjustments needed, calculated as the integer division of `(x - balance)` by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` incremented by 1. This accounts for scenarios where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, ensuring no division by zero occurs since `balance` cannot equal `x` in such cases.***
