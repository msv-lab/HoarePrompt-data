Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least `n + 2`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is the last updated value in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`. If the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and non-negative (i.e., `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`), then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This ensures that all cases where the conditions are met are accounted for, including when `(x - b)` is exactly zero, which would still satisfy the conditions.***
