The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The initial values of `n`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables along with the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is equal to 0, the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i` is equal for all indices from 1 to `n`, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` has a new element `0` appended.**
