Postcondition: ***`n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `s` is an input string. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1, indicating that the balance can be adjusted perfectly without any remainder. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, it is important to note that the division by zero would occur in the else case, leading to an undefined behavior which is a critical edge case not handled in the code. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, representing the number of complete cycles needed to adjust the balance.***
