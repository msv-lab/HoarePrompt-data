The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition of `s[i - 1]`. 

- If `s[0]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i - 1]` can either be `2` or `0`. 
- If `s[0]` is '1', then `prefix_balances[i - 1]` can either be `0` or `-2`. 

The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` will add `1` if `s[i - 1]` is '0' and subtract `1` if `s[i - 1]` is '1'.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, we don't have the specific value of `n`, but we know `i` is greater than `0`.

Therefore, for different cases of `s[0]`:

1. If `s[0]` is '0' and assuming `s[i - 1]` is also '0', then:
   - `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` could result in either `3` (if `prefix_balances[i - 1]` was `2`) or `1` (if it was `0`).

2. If `s[0]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then:
   - `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1` could result in either `1` (if `prefix_balances[i - 1]` was `2`) or `-1` (if it was `0`).

3. If `s[0]` is '1' and assuming `s[i - 1]` is '0', then:
   - `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` could result in either `1` (if `prefix_balances[i - 1]` was `0`) or `0` (if it was `-2`).

4. If `s[0]` is '1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then:
   - `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1` could result in either `-1` (if `prefix_balances[i - 1]` was `0`) or `-3` (if it was `-2`).

Since we have multiple possible outcomes based on the conditions, the output state will summarize these possibilities.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 3, 1, 1, -1, 0, -1, -3 based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[i - 1]`; `i` is `n + 1`**
