The code counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the string `s`. The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the results of these counts. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` depend on the content of the input string `s`, while `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`.**
