Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
