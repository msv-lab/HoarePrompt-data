The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing cumulative balances of '0's and '1's, initialized to 0 at index 0; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`; `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`; and `index` is increased by 3.
