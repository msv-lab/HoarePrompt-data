The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The values of `n`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been added to the `results` list, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s` up to index `n`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `-1` has been appended to `results`.**
