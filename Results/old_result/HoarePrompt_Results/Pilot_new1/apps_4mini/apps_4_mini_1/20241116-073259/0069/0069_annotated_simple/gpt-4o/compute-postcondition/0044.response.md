The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is an element from the `data` list. The value of `x` will depend on the value at that specific index in the `data` list. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances` (specifically assigned from `data[index + 1]`), `results` contains -1; `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index]**
