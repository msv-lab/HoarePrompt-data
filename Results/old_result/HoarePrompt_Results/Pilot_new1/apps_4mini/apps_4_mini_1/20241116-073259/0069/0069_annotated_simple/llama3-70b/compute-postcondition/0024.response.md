Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1, indicating no valid solution exists. Otherwise, the function prints the result of \((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1\), which accounts for the relationship between `x`, `balance`, and the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`. Special attention is given to ensure that division by zero does not occur when `cnt0` equals `cnt1`.***
