The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2] and `index` is increased by 3.
