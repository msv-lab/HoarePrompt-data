The variable `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0', or minus 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '1'. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known, and `i` is 2, so we are looking at `prefix_balances[1]`. The value of `prefix_balances[1]` can either be 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`. Therefore, the possible outcomes for `prefix_balances[2]` are:

- If `s[0]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[2] = prefix_balances[1] + 1`, resulting in either 2 or 0.
- If `s[0]` is '1', then `prefix_balances[2] = prefix_balances[1] - 1`, resulting in either 0 or -2.

Thus, the output state reflects these possibilities based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 2 or 0 if `s[0]` is '0'; `prefix_balances[i]` is either 0 or -2 if `s[0]` is '1'**
