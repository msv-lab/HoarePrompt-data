The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` is 1, so `n` takes the integer value from the second element of the `data` list. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `T` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of input values, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of input values, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
