The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so `index + 2` equals 3. Therefore, `s` will be set to the value of `data[3]`. The other variables `T`, `n`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of input values, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
