Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s` up to index `n`, and `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, then `0` is appended to `results`.***
