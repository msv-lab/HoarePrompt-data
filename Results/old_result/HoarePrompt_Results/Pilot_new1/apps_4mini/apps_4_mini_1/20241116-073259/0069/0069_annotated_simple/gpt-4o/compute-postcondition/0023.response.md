Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element `prefix_balances[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1`. The variable `balance` is equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times updating the prefix balances accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length `1`. The value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`.***
