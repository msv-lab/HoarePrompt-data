The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `T`, `n`, and `x`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `index` is 1.

Output State: **`T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `index` is 1**
