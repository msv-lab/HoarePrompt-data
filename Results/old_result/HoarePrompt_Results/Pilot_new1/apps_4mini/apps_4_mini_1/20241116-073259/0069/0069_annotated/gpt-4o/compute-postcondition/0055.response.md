According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues until `i = n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 2`, which is outside the current range of the loop. 

Since `prefix_balances[i]` can take on values based on the previous values of `s`, it does not need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute again, as the loop will not execute with `i` being `n + 2`.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 3, 1, 1, -1, 0, -1, -3 based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[i - 1]`; `i` is `n + 2`**
