The code attempts to print the value of `result`. However, since the variable `result` is not defined in the initial state provided, it will lead to an error when trying to execute the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program cannot proceed due to the undefined variable.

Output State: **Error: 'result' is not defined**
