Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 99`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints `-1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special care is taken to avoid division by zero, and if the previous condition is not met, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, representing the number of complete cycles needed to reach the balance. All cases are handled appropriately based on the values of `balance`, `x`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`.***
