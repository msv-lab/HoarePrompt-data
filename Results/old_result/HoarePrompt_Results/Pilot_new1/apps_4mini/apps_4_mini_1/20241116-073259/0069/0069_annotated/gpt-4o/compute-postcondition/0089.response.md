The code updates the value of `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at position `s[i - 1]`. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, and the value of `n` is unchanged. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` evaluates to either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is `'0'` or not. Therefore, the value of `prefix_balances[i]` will be the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` incremented by `1` if `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`, or decremented by `1` if it is not.

The states of `n` and `prefix_balances` are updated accordingly, but the exact values depend on the specific contents of `s` and the current values in `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
