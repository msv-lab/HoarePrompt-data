According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` iterable. The loop will execute once for each item in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty iterable, meaning it has at least one item. After the last iteration, the loop would have processed the first item in `results`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 items remaining.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `results` has at least 2 items left to process. 

State: **`results` is an iterable with at least 2 items**
