According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which could be either equal to or less than `n`. 

Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n + 1`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented. If `i` is currently at `n`, it will be incremented to `n + 1`, which is the exit condition for the loop. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state from `i` to `n + 1` to reflect that the loop will now attempt to execute one more time. The conditions on `prefix_balances[i]` do not need to change because they depend on the value of `s[0]`, which is not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 2 or 0 if `s[0]` is '0'; `prefix_balances[i]` is either 0 or -2 if `s[0]` is '1'; `i` is n + 1**
