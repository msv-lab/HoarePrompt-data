Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings derived from the first two elements of `data` with leading zeros removed, and if either was originally empty, it is set to '0'. The lengths of `a` and `b` are equal. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='.***
