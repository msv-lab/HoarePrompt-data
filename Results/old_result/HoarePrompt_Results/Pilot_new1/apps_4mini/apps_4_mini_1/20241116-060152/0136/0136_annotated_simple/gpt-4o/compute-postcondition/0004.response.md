The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous value of `a` was an empty string. The values of `b` and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input**.
