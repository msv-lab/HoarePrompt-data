The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous state indicates that `a` is a string derived from the first string in `data` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` was originally empty, it is set to '0'. The variable `b` being an empty string before the assignment does not affect the state of `a`. The output state reflects the new value of `b` while maintaining the state of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string derived from the first string in `data` with leading zeros removed; if `a` was originally empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0'**
