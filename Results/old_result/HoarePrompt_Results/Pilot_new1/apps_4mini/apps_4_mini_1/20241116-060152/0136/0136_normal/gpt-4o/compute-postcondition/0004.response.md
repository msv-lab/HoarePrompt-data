The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`. The variable `b` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` and the unchanged state of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string representation of the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed**
