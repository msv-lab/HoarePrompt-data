The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing at most \(10^6\) digits, and may include leading zeroes. The functionality of the function is to perform an operation on these two string representations of non-negative integers. However, the specific output or operation performed by the function is not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings.**
