Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings from user input, removes any leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first number is smaller, '>' if it is larger, and '=' if they are equal. If either number is empty after removing leading zeros, it is treated as '0'. The function does not return any value but outputs the comparison result directly. **
