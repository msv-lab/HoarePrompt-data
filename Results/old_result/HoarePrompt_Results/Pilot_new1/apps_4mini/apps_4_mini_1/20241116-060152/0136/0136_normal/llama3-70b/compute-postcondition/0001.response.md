The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading zeroes. The initial state of `a` is not affected, and the new state of `b` will depend on the input provided. If the input is an empty string after stripping leading zeroes, `b` will become an empty string. If the input is a string of zeroes, `b` will also become an empty string. For any other input, `b` will reflect the input without leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed**
