The value of `a` is assigned the value of `input()` after removing any leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, it may have leading zeroes that will be stripped away. If `a` is initially "000123", it will become "123". If `a` is initially "0000", it will become an empty string. The variable `b` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, and `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
