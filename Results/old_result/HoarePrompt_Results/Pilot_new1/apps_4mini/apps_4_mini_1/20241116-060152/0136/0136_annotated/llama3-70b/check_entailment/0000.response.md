To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to evaluate the code and its annotations in relation to the requirements specified.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program must read two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which can have leading zeroes.
2. It should compare these integers and print:
   - "<" if `a < b`
   - ">" if `a > b`
   - "=" if `a == b`
3. The input size can be very large (up to 10^6 digits), and leading zeroes must be handled correctly.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = input().lstrip('0')  # Removes leading zeros from a
    b = input().lstrip('0')  # Removes leading zeros from b
    if (a == b):
        print('=')
    else:
        if (a < b):
            print('<')
        else:
            print('>')
```

#### Key Points from the Code:
- The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeroes from both `a` and `b`.
- It then compares the stripped strings lexicographically.
- The program prints the appropriate symbol based on the comparison.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
1. **Leading Zeroes**: The use of `lstrip('0')` effectively handles leading zeroes, which is a requirement in the problem description.
2. **Equality Check**: The program checks for equality first, which is correct.
3. **Lexicographical Comparison**: The comparison using `<` and `>` is valid for strings of equal length after leading zeroes have been stripped.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are "0" (i.e., "0" vs "0"). After stripping, both would become empty strings, leading to a comparison of empty strings which is incorrect. This means it would incorrectly print `=` when it should print `=`.
- If both inputs are entirely made up of zeroes, the output would also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given that there are cases where the program does not behave as expected (specifically when both inputs are "0" or consist entirely of leading zeroes), the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

The annotations about the program's behavior do not explicitly cover the scenario of both inputs being "0" or entirely zeroes, which influenced the reasoning that the program is incorrect.
