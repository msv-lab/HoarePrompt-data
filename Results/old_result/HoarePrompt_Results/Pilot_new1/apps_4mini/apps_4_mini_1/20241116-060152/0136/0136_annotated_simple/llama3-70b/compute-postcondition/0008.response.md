The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string `'>'`. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect their state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros; the value of `a` is larger than or equal to the value of `b`, and the value of `a` is not equal to the value of `b`.**
