Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, and `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; otherwise, the output is '>'. This comparison accurately accounts for all cases, including scenarios where `a` and `b` differ in length, ensuring that the relationship between `a` and `b` is correctly represented.***
