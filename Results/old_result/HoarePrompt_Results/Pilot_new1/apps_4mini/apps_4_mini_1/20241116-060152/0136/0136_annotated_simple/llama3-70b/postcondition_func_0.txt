The function accepts two non-negative integers as input, represented as strings, potentially containing leading zeros. It compares the two integers after removing leading zeros and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first integer is less than the second, and '>' if the first integer is greater than the second. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result of the comparison.
