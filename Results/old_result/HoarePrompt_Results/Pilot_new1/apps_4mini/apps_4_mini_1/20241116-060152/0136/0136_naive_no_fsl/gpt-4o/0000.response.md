Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly handles the comparison of two very long integers when they have leading zeros. Specifically, it uses the `lstrip('0')` method to remove leading zeros, but does not account for the case where both numbers are entirely made up of zeros (e.g., "0000" and "0000"). 

For example:
- Input:
```
0000
0000
```
- Expected Output: `=`
- Actual Output: `=` (correct in this case, but the handling of leading zeros is not robust)

Another case that could cause issues is when one number is entirely zeros and the other has leading zeros but is non-zero:
- Input:
```
0000
0001
```
- Expected Output: `<`
- Actual Output: `<` (correct in this case)

However, the program does not adequately handle the case where both inputs are leading zeros and should return `=`. 

Moreover, it could be more efficient to compare the lengths of the stripped strings first before performing lexicographical comparisons, which is not fully optimized in the current implementation. 

In conclusion, while the program works correctly for many cases, it does not comprehensively handle all potential edge cases, particularly those involving leading zeros and entirely zero inputs. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
