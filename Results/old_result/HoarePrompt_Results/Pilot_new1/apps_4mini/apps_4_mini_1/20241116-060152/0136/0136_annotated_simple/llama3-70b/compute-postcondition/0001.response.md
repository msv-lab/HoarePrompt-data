The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it takes user input and removes any leading zeros from that input. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, and since `b` is now modified based on user input, its new value can be any non-negative integer string without leading zeros. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `a` and the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros (leading zeros removed)**
