Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is the string representation of the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed, and if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'; the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`; and `a` is lexicographically less than `b`.***
