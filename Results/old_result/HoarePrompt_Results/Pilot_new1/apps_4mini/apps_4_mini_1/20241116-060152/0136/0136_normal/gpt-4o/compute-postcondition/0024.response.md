Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers with leading zeros removed, with `a` being at least as long as `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output will be '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, or '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. Additionally, if either `a` or `b` is empty, it is treated as '0', ensuring valid comparisons throughout.***
