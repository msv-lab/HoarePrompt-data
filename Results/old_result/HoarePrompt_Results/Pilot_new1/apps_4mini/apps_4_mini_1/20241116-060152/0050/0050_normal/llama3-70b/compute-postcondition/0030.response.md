The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
