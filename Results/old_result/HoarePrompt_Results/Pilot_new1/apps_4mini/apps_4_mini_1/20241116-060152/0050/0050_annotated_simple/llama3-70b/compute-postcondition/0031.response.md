Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty list with no zero elements, `r` remains greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, and since `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without modifying `r`.***
