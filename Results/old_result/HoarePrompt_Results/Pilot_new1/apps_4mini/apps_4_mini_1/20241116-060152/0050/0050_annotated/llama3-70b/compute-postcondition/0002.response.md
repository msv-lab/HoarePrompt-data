The code assigns a new value to `b`, which is created by mapping the input values (split by spaces) to integers. The previous state of `b` is not defined, but it will now hold a list of integers based on the input. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment to `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of n integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input**
