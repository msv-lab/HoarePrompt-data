To calculate `total_bourles`, we first need to determine the values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` based on the initial state provided.

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30
   - `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000
   - `s` is a list of integers from input
   - `b` is a list of integers from input
   - `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`
   - `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`
   - `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`
   - `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`

2. **Calculating `total_bourles`:**
   - `total_bourles` is calculated using the formula: `total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.

Since the specific values of `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, and `remaining_bourles` are not provided, we can only describe the relationship.

Output State: **`total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles` based on the values of `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, and `remaining_bourles`.**
