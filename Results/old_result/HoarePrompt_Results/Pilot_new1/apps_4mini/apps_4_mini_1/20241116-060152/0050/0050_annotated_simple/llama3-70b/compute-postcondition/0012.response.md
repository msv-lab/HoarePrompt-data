Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `shares` is updated. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[0]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` when divided by `s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` unchanged at 0. Additionally, if `s` is empty or `s[0]` is not properly defined, it should be noted that the behavior may be undefined.***
