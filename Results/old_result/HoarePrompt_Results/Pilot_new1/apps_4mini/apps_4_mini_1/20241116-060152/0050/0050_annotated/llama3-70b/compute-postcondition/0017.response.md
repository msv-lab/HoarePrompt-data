Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, and `shares` is updated accordingly. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is incremented by the result of integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
