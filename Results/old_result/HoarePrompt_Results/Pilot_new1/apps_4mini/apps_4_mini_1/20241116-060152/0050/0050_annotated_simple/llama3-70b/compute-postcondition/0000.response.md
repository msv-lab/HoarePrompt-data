The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned based on the input values provided by the user. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a single line of input, splits it into separate values, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `r`. Other variables `s` and `b` remain unaffected as they are not involved in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` will hold the values provided by the user as integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers**
