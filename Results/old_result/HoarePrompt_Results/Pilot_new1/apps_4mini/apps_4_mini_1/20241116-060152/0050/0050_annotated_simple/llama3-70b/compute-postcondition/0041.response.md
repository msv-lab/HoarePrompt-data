Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is a non-empty list with no zero elements, and `r` remains greater than or equal to the first element of `s`. If `shares` was greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without modifying `r`.***
