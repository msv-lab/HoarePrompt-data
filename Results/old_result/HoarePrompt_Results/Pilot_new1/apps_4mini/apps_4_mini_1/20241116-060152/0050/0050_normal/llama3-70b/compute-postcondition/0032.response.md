According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. The value of `m` does not need to change since it is already greater than 0.

State: **`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
