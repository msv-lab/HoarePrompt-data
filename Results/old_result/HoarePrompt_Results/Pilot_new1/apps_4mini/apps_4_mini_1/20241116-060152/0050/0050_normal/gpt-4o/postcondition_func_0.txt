The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from user input, along with two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial amount `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, computes the remaining amount after buying shares, and then calculates the total amount of money after selling those shares at the maximum sell price, which it prints. The function does not return any value.
