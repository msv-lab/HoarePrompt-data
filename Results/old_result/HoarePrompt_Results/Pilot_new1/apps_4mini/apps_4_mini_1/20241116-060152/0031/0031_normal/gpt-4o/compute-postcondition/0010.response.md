The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is `2^n`. Therefore, after the execution, `denominator` becomes `(1 * 2^n) % MOD`, which simplifies to `2^n % MOD`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n % MOD, `denominator` is 2^n % MOD, `i` is 0**
