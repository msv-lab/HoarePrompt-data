The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`. It checks if `k` is greater than \(2^n\); if so, it prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), it calculates the product of values based on `k` and `2^n`, computes values `A` and `B`, and prints their reduced forms modulo \(10^6 + 3\). The function does not return any value.
