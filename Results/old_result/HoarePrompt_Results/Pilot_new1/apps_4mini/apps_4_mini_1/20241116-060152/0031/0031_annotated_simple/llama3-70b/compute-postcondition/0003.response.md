According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, starting with `i` at 0. Since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will definitely execute. The initial value of `i` is 0 before the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0. The other variables do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
