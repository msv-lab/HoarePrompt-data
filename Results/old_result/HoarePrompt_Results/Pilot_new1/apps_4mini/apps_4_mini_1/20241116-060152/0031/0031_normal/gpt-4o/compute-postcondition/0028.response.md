The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the function outputs the tuple (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), no action is taken, and the function continues executing. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds \(2^n\), it outputs (1, 1). If `k` does not exceed \(2^n\), the function continues without any output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, outputs (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\); if `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), no action is taken.**
