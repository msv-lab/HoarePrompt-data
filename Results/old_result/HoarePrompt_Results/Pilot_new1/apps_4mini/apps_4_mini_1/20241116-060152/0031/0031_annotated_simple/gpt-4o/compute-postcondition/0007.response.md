The variable `denominator` is assigned the value `1`. This does not affect the previous values of `n`, `k`, `total_days`, or `numerator`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to `2^n`; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to `2^n`; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1**
