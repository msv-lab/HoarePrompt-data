The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is \(2^n\) and the initial value of `denominator` is 1, the new value of `denominator` becomes \(1 \times 2^n = 2^n\). The other variables (`n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is \(2^n\), `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 0**
