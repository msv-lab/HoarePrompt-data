According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `k` is still greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n; `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1); `denominator` is 2^(2n); `i` is 2; `k` is greater than 2**
