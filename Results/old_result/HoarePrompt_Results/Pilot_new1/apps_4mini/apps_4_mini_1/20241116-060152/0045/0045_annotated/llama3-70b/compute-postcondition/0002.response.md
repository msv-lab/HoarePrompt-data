The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, where `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is not a multiple of `b`, the new value of `b` will be the remainder of `a` divided by the previous value of `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but we know that `a` is not a multiple of `b`, which ensures that `b` will be less than its previous value after the operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` after the operation.

Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `a` is not a multiple of `b`.**
