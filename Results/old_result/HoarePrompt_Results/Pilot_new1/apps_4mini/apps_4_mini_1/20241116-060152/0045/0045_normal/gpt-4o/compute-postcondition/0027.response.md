Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first checks if the minimum sum of the first `k` natural numbers exceeds `n`, returning -1 if it does. If the sum does not exceed `n`, it calculates how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n` and distributes the remainder across a sequence of `k` integers, returning this sequence as a list. If `k` is 0, the function will return an empty list. **
