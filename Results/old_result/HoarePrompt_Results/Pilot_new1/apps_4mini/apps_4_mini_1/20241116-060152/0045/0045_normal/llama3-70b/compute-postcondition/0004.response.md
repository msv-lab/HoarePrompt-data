To analyze the code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` with the given initial state where `a` is updated to the previous value of `b` and `b` is updated to a non-zero value, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial State Interpretation**: 
   - `a` is set to the previous value of `b` (let's denote the previous value of `b` as `b_prev`).
   - `b` is a non-zero value (let's denote this value as `b_val`).

2. **Execution of the Code**:
   - The code `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment.
   - The right-hand side is evaluated first:
     - `b` will take the value of `b_val`.
     - `a % b` will compute the modulus of the previous value of `a` (which is `b_prev`) with the new value of `b` (which is `b_val`).
   - After evaluating the right-hand side, the left-hand side assignment takes place:
     - `a` will be updated to `b_val`.
     - `b` will be updated to `b_prev % b_val`.

3. **Output State Calculation**:
   - After the assignment:
     - `a` is now `b_val`.
     - `b` is now `b_prev % b_val`.

Thus, the final output state reflects the current values of `a` and `b` after the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is `b_val`, `b` is `b_prev % b_val`**
