The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 for `i` in the range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is `k - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
