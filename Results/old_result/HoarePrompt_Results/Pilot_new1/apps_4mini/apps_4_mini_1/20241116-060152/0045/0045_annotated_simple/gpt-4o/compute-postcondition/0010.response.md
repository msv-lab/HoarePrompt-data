Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is the value of `n` minus `d * min_sum`. If `remainder` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the sequence can be perfectly divided into `k` parts without any remaining value. If `remainder` is not 0, the loop continues to execute, and the values of `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` remain unchanged.***
