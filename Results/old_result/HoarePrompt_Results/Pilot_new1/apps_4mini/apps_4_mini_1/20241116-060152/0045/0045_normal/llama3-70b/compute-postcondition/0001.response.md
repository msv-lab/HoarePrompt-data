According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is updated to the result of `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero after this update.

Since `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, we need to ensure that after the modulo operation, `b` remains non-zero. This means that `a` must not be a multiple of the previous value of `b` for `b` to be non-zero.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `a` is not a multiple of the previous value of `b`.

State: **`a` is updated to the previous value of `b` and `b` is not zero**
