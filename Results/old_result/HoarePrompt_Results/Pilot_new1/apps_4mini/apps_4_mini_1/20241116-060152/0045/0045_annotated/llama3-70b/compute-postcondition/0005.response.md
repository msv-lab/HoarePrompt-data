According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (true), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is greater than 0, which means the loop can indeed execute one more time without any adjustments. 

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition for the loop to execute again is already satisfied.

State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `b` is greater than 0**
