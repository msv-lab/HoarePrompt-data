To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).

2. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum sum required for `k` strictly increasing positive integers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, the function returns `-1`, which is correct.

3. **Finding the GCD**: The program calculates the maximum GCD `d` by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. It then constructs the initial sequence as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which gives a sequence of the first `k` multiples of `d`.

4. **Adjusting the Sequence**: The program then checks if there is any remainder left after forming the sequence. It distributes this remainder among the last elements of the sequence, ensuring that the sequence remains strictly increasing.

5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program does handle the case where `n` is less than the minimum sum required for `k` integers.
   - However, it does not handle cases where `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum`. In this case, the sequence would be the minimum sequence, and the program would not adjust it correctly if the remainder is zero.

### Example of Failure
Let's consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 2`:
- The minimum sum for 2 strictly increasing integers is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- The function calculates `d = 3 // 3 = 1`, and the sequence generated would be `[1, 2]`.
- This is correct since the sum is `3` and the GCD is `1`.

Now consider `n = 5` and `k = 3`:
- The minimum sum for 3 strictly increasing integers is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- The function correctly returns `-1`, which is expected.

However, if we take `n = 7` and `k = 3`:
- The minimum sum is still `6`, and `d` would be `7 // 6 = 1`, giving the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` which sums to `6` and not `7`. The program does not correctly handle the case where the remainder allows for a valid adjustment to meet `n`.

### Conclusion
The program fails to produce a correct output for certain inputs where the sum can be adjusted but is not handled due to the way it distributes the remainder. Therefore, it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
