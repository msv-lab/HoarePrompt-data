The variables `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The constraints ensure that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but without specific input values, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of these variables based on the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers assigned from input, maintaining the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
