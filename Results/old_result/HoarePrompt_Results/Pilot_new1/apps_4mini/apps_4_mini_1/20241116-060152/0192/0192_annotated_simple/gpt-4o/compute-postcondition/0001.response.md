The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the result based on the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is greater than `y`, and both are integers within the specified range. 

Let `d = x - y`. Since `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, `d` is guaranteed to be a positive integer. The expression can be simplified as follows:

1. `(x - y) // 2` gives the integer division of `d` by 2.
2. `(x - y) % 2` gives the remainder when `d` is divided by 2, which will be either 0 or 1.

Thus, the overall expression calculates the number of pairs that can be formed with the difference between `x` and `y`, adjusting for whether the difference is even or odd.

Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numeric output. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculations based on the relationship between `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is a new integer, `y` is a new integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000; the result of the expression is (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
