To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to modify it to have a side length of `y`. The modifications must keep the triangle non-degenerate, meaning the lengths of the sides must always be positive integers. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided calculates the minimum number of seconds required using the formula:
```python
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```
This formula effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations state that the function calculates `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which is a way to compute the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. This means that the function is trying to find out how many steps it takes to reduce the side length from `x` to `y`.

### Validating Against Examples:
Let's validate the examples provided in the problem description:

1. **Example Input:** `6 3`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Calculation: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Incorrect)

2. **Example Input:** `8 5`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Incorrect)

3. **Example Input:** `22 4`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Calculation: `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required for all the given test cases. The formula used does not account for the necessary adjustments to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate throughout the process, especially when reducing side lengths significantly.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for multiple cases.

Correctness: **False**
