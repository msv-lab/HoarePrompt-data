Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute `n // 2` times, comparing characters at indices `i` and `n - 1 - i`. If any characters are not equal, the function returns False. If all characters are equal for all iterations, the loop completes without returning, implying the string is a palindrome. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return False, indicating that the string is trivially a palindrome.**
