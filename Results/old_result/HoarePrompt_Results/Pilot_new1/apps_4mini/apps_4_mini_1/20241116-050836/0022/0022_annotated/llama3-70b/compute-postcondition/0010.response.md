The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a new input string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
