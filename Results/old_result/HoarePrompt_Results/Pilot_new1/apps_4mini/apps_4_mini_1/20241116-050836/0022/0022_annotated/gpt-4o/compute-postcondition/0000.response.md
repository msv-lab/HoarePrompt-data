The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, which calculates the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of only English letters and has a length between 1 and 1000, `n` will hold an integer value between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The value of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`**
