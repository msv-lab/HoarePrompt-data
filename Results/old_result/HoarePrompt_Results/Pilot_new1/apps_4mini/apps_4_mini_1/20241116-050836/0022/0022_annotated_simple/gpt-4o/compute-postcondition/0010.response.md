Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False, indicating that the characters do not match. If they do match, the function does not return anything, and the program continues executing beyond this point.***
