Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, the loop checks characters in `s` from both ends moving towards the center. If any characters at indices `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal, the function returns False. If the loop completes without returning False, it implies that `s` is a palindrome up to the midpoint. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and the function may return True or continue processing, indicating that `s` is trivially a palindrome. If `n` is 0 (which is not possible given the initial state), the loop also would not execute.**
