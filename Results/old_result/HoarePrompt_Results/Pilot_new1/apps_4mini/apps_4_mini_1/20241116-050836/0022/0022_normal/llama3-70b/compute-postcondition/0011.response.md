Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` has been incremented by 1. If the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in the string `s` do not match, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that the string may still be a palindrome, pending further checks.***
