According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2, which means `n // 2` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

Additionally, since the loop is comparing characters at indices `i` and `n - 1 - i`, the character at index `i` of `s` will be the first character in the string during the next iteration, and the character at index `n - 1 - i` will be the character at index `n - 1 - 1`, which is the second-to-last character if `n` is at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
