Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False if the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` are not equal, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True and the loop continues to check further characters, maintaining the initial conditions.***
