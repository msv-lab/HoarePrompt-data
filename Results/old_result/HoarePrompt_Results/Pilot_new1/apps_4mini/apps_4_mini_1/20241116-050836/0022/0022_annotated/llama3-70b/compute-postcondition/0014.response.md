The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n // 2`, and `is_spalindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
