Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n` minus the remainder. If the remainder is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n` plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. This ensures that `result` is the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`, rounding down if the remainder is 5 or less, and rounding up if the remainder is greater than 5.***
