The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` calculates the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`. Since `n` is not divisible by 10 and `n` modulo 10 is greater than 5, the value of `10 - n % 10` will be a positive integer less than 5. Thus, when added to `n`, it results in the next multiple of 10. 

The output state reflects that `n` remains unchanged and the printed result is the next multiple of 10 after `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, and `n` modulo 10 is greater than 5; the printed value is the next multiple of 10 after `n`.**
