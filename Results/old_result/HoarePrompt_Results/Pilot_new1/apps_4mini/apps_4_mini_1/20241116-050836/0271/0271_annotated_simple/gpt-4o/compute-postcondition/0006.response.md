Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and `remainder` is the last digit of `n`. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`. This ensures that `result` is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 based on the value of `remainder`, handling all possible values of `remainder` from 0 to 9.***
