The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a single line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values after the execution. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input**
