The code executes a print statement that outputs a plus sign. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values between 0 and 100 inclusive. `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is '+'**
