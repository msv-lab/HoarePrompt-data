The code snippet contains a print statement that outputs a string `?`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]. The value of `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `z` is greater than 0, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., x â‰¤ y + z); printed output is '?'**
