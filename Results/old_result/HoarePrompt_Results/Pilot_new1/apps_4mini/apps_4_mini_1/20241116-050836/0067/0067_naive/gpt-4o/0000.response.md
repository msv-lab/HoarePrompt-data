To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the program and see if it covers all potential cases as described.

The program reads three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively. It then calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes:

- `min_upvotes = x`
- `max_upvotes = x + z`
- `min_downvotes = y`
- `max_downvotes = y + z`

The program then checks:

1. If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it prints `'-'`, indicating that downvotes are guaranteed to be more.
2. If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it prints `'+'`, indicating that upvotes are guaranteed to be more.
3. If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`, indicating that the result is uncertain.

Now, let's consider the edge cases:

1. **Case when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The program will check if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` (which is false) and `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` (which is also false). Thus, it would print `'?'`, which is correct because we can have one upvote or one downvote.

2. **Case when `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`:**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`.
   - The program will correctly print `'-'` since there are more downvotes than upvotes.

3. **Case when `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The program will print `'+'`, which is correct as there are guaranteed more upvotes than downvotes.

4. **Case when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`:**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The program will correctly print `'0'`, as the upvotes and downvotes are equal.

5. **Case when `x = 0`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`:**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 2`.
   - The program will print `'?'`, which is correct as we could have either 1 downvote or 2 downvotes.

After analyzing these cases, the program handles all scenarios outlined in the problem description correctly. It accurately determines when the result is certain and when it is uncertain based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Therefore, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
