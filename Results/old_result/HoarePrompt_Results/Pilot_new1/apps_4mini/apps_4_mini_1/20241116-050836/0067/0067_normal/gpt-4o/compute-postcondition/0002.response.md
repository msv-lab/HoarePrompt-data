The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The value of `x` is based on the input and `z` is also based on the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_upvotes` is now calculated from the values of `x` and `z`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on the input, `y` is an integer based on the input, `z` is an integer based on the input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z**.
