Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The value of `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z >= x`).***
