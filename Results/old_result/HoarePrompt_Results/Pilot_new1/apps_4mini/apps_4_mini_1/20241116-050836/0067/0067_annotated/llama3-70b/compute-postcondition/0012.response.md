Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `z` is equal to 0, the output is '0'. Otherwise, the output is '?'. It is guaranteed that `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, which means that if `z` is positive, `x` can take values in the range from `y` to `y + z`.***
