The code assigns the value of `y + z` to `max_downvotes`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y` (which is an integer between 0 and 100) and `z` (which is also an integer between 0 and 100). Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be an integer between `0 + 0` (which is 0) and `100 + 100` (which is 200). 

The states of the other variables (`x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`) remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`**
