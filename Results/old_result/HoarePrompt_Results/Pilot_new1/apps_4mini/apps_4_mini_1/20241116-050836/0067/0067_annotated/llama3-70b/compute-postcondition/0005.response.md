The `print('-')` statement outputs a hyphen to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of these variables, but includes the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is less than `y`. A hyphen '-' is printed to the console.**
