The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values based on the input provided through `input().split()`, which will split the input string into separate values and `map(int, ...)` converts them into integers. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are overwritten by these new values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now assigned new integer values from the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are new input integers**
