Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers with values between 0 and 100 inclusive. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, the output is '0' if `z` is 0, otherwise the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the output is '?' regardless of the value of `z`.***
