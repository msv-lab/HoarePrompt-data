Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, the output is '0' if `z` is 0, otherwise the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the output is '?' regardless of the value of `z`.***
