The code executes a print statement that outputs a string. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as the print function does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement has executed but does not change the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is less than `y`; and the print statement outputs '-'**
