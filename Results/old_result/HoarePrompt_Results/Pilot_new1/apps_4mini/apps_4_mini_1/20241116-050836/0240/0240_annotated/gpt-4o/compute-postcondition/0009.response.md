According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The variable `perm` holds the current permutation being processed. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop continues as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to process.
2. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the elements in `chars`. After the last permutation, there are no more permutations left to yield.

Since `perm` is already set to the next permutation of `chars`, and we are at the end of the last iteration, there are no remaining permutations to yield. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that there are still permutations left. Specifically, we need to set `perm` to the next permutation after the current one.

Thus, to allow for another iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and there are more permutations of `chars` remaining to process.**
