Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing digits with at least 2 characters, and `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n`, which is initially the second character of `s` or an empty string, is updated by concatenating `c` to it. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged as either the second character of `s` or an empty string.***
