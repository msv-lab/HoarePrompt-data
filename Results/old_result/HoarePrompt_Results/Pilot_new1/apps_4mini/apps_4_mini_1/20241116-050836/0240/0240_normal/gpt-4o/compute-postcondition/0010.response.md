The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in the string `perm`. Since `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold the same value as `perm`. The value of `chars` remains unchanged, and the previous values of `perm` and `candidate` are affected only by this assignment. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is now the same as `perm`**
