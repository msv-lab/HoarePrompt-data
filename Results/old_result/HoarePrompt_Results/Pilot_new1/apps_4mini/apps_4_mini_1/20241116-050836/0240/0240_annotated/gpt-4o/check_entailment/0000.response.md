Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the requirement that the smallest possible integer `n` must not have leading zeros, except in the case where `n` is equal to zero itself. The function `generate_possible_numbers` generates permutations of the remaining characters but does not ensure that the resulting number does not start with a zero unless the entire number is "0". 

For example, if the input is `s = "003512"` and `sub = "021"`, the program might yield `0213`, which is invalid because it has leading zeros. The annotations indicate that the program checks for valid numbers, but the validation does not adequately address the leading zero condition for numbers greater than zero.

Additionally, the `is_valid_number` function checks if the length of `num_str` equals `n_len`, but `n_len` is not defined within its scope. This could lead to errors or incorrect results if the function is called improperly.

Therefore, there are potential cases where the program does not adhere to the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs.
