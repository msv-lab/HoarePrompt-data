Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` that contains all characters from `s` that are present in `t`, and then concatenates `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the resulting string. If `s` is empty or contains no characters found in `t`, `n` will only consist of `t`, and the function will return the integer value of `t`. It does not handle cases where the concatenated string cannot be converted to an integer, which could lead to a ValueError if `n` contains non-numeric characters.**
