`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in the string `perm`. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `perm`. The state of the other variable `chars` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm**
