The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means that `candidate` will be a string created by concatenating all elements in the iterable `perm`. The initial state indicates that `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and since `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` will also be a non-empty string of digits. The value of `candidate` will be equal to that of `perm`. The values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
