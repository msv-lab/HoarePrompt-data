Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing digits, `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`, `n` is a string that may include the first character `c` of `s` if `c` is an element of `t_set`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to include `c`; otherwise, `n` remains an empty string.***
