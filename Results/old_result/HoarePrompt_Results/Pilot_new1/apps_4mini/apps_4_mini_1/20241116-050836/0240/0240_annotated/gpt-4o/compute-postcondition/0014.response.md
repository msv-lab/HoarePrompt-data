Output State: **If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will execute for all permutations of `chars`, yielding valid candidates based on the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and there are no yielded candidates. If `chars` contains only unique digits, all permutations will be processed; if `chars` contains duplicate digits, some permutations may yield the same candidate. The variable `perm` will represent each permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` will be the string formed from `perm`. If no valid candidates are found, nothing is yielded.**
