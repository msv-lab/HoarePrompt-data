According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `permutations` of `chars`. The loop will iterate through all permutations of `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. 

Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, it will need to be updated to the second permutation of `chars`. The `candidate` will also need to be updated accordingly to reflect this new `perm`. 

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables (`chars`, `sub`, etc.) remain unchanged.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
