Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that pass the `is_valid_number` check when evaluated against `sub`. It does not return a list but rather a generator that produces valid candidates one at a time. If `chars` is empty, no candidates will be yielded. Additionally, if `chars` contains duplicate digits, some permutations may yield the same candidate. The function does not handle the insertion of `sub` into `chars`; it only checks permutations of `chars` against the validity condition.**
