Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. The variable `found` continues to be True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, allowing for the possibility that `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or its previous value plus 1.***
