Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating a successful match. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `found`, `j`, `i`, or `n`, and the program continues executing.***
