The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of either 1 or incremented by 1; `found` is True; `i` is `n - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `n - 1`; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`; the sorted values of `window_counts` match the respective values in `counts` for all pairs of counts and targets, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
