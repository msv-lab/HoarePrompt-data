Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a new list of integers reflecting the updated counts, and `color` is the second element of `colors`. If `color` is not already present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
