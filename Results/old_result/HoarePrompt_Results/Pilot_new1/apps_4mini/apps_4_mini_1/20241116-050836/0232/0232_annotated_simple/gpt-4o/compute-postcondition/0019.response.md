Output State: **`if all(current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for color in desired_counts) is true, then the loop executes until at least one current_counts[color] becomes less than desired_counts[color]; right is n - 1; current_counts[colors[right]] is incremented by 1` and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is increased by 1.**
