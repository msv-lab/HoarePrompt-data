Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains `color` with a value of either 1 or incremented by 1; if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the respective values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and the program continues without any changes to `found`.***
