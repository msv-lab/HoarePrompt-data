Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if the counts of `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts`, indicating a successful condition check. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is still 1.***
