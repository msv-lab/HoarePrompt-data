Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is at most `n` and each element is at least 1, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 1 to `m` to the corresponding elements in `k`, `current_counts` is updated to include the count of `colors[right]`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**
