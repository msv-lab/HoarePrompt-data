Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer, `counts` is a list of integers, `found` is False, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary. If `color` (assigned the value of `colors[0]`) is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, no changes are made to `window_counts`.***
