Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `found` is False, `i` is n, `j` is n. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, indicating that this color has been encountered for the first time. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
