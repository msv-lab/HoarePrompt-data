Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` to `n-1`. The variable `found` is True, indicating that the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop has not executed, and `window_counts` remains empty, but `found` is still True. If `colors` is empty, the loop has not executed, and `window_counts` remains empty, but `found` is True.***
