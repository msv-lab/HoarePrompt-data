The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. Since `right` is equal to `n`, we are updating the count for the color associated with the index `n` in the `colors` list. The state of `n` remains unchanged, but the state of `current_counts` is modified. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than its previous value, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1, and `right` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than previous value, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1, `right` is `n`**
