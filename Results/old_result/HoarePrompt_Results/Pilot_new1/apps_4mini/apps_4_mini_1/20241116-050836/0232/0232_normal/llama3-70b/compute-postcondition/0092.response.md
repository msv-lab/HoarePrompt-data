Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is False, `j` is `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts` is updated such that if `color` (assigned the value of `colors[j]`) is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, it remains unchanged.***
