Output State: **`window_counts` contains colors from the range of indices between `i` and `n`, with their respective counts. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, then `found` is set to True. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop executes; if `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, leaving `window_counts` as an empty dictionary and `found` as False.**
