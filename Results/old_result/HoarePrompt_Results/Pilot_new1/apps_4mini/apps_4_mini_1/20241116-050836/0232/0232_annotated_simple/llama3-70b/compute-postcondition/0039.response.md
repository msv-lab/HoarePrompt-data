Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer, `counts` is a list of integers, and if the counts of colors in `window_counts` (after incrementing `window_counts[color]` by 1) match the sorted values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged and the loop continues.***
