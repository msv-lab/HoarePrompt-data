Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding elements in `counts` for all elements. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `n` is not greater than `i + 1`), `found` remains False, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If the loop executes but does not find a match after all iterations, `found` remains False, `j` will be equal to `n`, and `window_counts` will contain counts of colors encountered in the range from `i` to `n - 1`.**
