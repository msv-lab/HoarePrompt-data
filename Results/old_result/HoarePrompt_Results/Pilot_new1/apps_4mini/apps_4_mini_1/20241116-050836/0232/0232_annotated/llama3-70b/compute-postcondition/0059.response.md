Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `window_counts` is a dictionary that will have `color` added with a value of 0 if it was not already present. The variables `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `found` is False. If `color` was not in `window_counts`, it is now added with a count of 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, it remains unchanged.***
