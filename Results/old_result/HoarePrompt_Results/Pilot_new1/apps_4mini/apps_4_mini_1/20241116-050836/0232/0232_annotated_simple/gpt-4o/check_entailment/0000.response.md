To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it adheres to the problem description. 

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have `n` Jedi Knights each with a lightsaber of one of `m` possible colors.
2. We need to find a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights such that the counts of each color in that interval match the desired counts specified by `k`.

### Code Analysis:
- The function starts by creating a dictionary `desired_counts` that maps each color to its desired count.
- It also initializes a `current_counts` defaultdict to keep track of the counts of the lightsaber colors in the current window defined by `left` and `right`.
- The outer loop iterates over each knight (from `0` to `n-1`), incrementing the count of the current knight's color.
- The inner while loop checks if the current counts meet or exceed the desired counts. If they do, it checks if they match exactly, returning 'YES' if they do.
- If the counts exceed the desired counts, it shrinks the window from the left until the condition is no longer met.
- If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns 'NO'.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. **Minimum Input Case**: If `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and the color is `1`, with the desired count `k = [1]`, the output should be 'YES'. The program handles this correctly.
2. **Exact Match**: If `n = 5`, `m = 2`, colors are `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`, and `k = [1, 2]`, the program should return 'YES'. The program handles this correctly.
3. **Excess Count**: If `n = 5`, `m = 2`, colors are `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`, and `k = [2, 2]`, the program should return 'NO' since it cannot find an interval matching exactly 2 of each color. The program handles this correctly.
4. **No Possible Interval**: If `n = 4`, colors are `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, and `k = [1, 3]`, the program should return 'NO'. The program handles this correctly.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, we find that the program correctly implements the logic to find the desired contiguous interval of Jedi Knights. It handles all cases as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correctly designed to handle the requirements of the problem as stated. It checks for both the presence of the required counts and ensures they are contiguous, returning the appropriate results based on the conditions outlined.
