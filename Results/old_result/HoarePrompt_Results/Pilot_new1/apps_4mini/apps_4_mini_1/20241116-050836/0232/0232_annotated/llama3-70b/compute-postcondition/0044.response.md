The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of the `color` key in the `window_counts` dictionary by 1. The variable `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`, and since `j` is equal to `i + 2`, the value of `color` is determined based on the `colors` list at that specific index. 

If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is initialized with a value of 0 before this increment operation. However, since the operation is `+= 1`, we can infer that `color` must already exist in `window_counts` at this point for the increment to take place.

The state of `color_counts`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remains unchanged, and we only see a change in `window_counts` where the count of `color` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `i` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than `i + 2; `j` is equal to `i + 2; `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`; `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
