The variable `desired_counts` is assigned a dictionary created by zipping together a range from 1 to `m + 1` and the list `k`. This means that each unique integer from 1 to `m` will be paired with the corresponding value from `k`, resulting in a dictionary where the keys are the integers from 1 to `m` and the values are the elements from the list `k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`.**
