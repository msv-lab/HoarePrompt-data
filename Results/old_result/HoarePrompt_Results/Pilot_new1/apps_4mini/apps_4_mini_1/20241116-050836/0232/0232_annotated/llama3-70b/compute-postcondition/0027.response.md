The variable `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `color` is `colors[j]`, which is a key in `window_counts`, and since `color` was already present, its count will increase by 1. The states of the other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**
