The `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`, and since we know that `color` is not in `window_counts`, it has been initialized to 0 prior to this operation. Therefore, after the increment, `window_counts[color]` becomes 1. The values of other variables (`found`, `i`, `j`, `n`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1**
