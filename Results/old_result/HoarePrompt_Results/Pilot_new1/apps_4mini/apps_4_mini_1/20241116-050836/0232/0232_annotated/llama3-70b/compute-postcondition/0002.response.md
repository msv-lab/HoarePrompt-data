The code assigns a new value to the variable `counts`, which is created by mapping the `input` values (split into a list of strings) to integers. The previous state of `counts` is not specified, but it is being overwritten with a new list of integers. The variables `n`, `m`, and `colors` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers from input, and `counts` is a new list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers from input, and `counts` is a new list of integers from input**
