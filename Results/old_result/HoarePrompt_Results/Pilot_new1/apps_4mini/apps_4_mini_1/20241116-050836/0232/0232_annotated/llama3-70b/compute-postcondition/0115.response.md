Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating that the current window satisfies the required conditions. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, `window_counts` includes the key `color` with its incremented value. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, leaving `found` as False and `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop will not start, and `window_counts` will remain unchanged, and `found` will still be False.**
