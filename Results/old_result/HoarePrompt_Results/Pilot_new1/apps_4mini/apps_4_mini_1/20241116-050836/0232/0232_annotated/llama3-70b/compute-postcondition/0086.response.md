According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that if `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, and if `found` is False, `window_counts` remains unchanged and empty. 

Since `found` is False, `window_counts` is unchanged and empty, which means we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to its current value plus 1, and `n` must remain unchanged.

State: **`found` is False, `window_counts` is empty, `i` is less than n (specifically, `i` is current value + 1), `n` remains unchanged**
