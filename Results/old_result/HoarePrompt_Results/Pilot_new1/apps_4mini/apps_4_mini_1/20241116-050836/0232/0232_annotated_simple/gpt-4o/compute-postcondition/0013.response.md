Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} `k_{i}` ≤ `n`, and at least one `current_counts[color]` is greater than `desired_counts[color]` for some color in `desired_counts`. If all `current_counts[color]` match `desired_counts[color]` for each color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
