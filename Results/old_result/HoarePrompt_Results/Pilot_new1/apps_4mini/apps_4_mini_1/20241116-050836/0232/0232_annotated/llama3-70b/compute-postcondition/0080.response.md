Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with unique colors as keys and their respective counts as values. If the counts of the colors in `window_counts` match the target counts (when sorted), then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, and the state of `window_counts` remains unchanged except for the increment of `window_counts[color]` by 1.***
