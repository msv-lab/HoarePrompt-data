The variable `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not already a key in `color_counts`, it was initialized to 0 before this operation, so the new value will be 1. If `color` was already present, its value is increased by 1, but the exact previous value is not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `color_counts[color]` has been incremented.

Output State: **`color_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1**
