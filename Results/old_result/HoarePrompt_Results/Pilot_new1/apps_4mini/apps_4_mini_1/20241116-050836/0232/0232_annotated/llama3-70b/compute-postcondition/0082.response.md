Output State: **`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` to `n-1`. If `j` has executed at least once and the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, then `found` is True; otherwise, it remains False. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, and `found` is False. If `colors` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `window_counts` will be empty, and `found` will be False.**
