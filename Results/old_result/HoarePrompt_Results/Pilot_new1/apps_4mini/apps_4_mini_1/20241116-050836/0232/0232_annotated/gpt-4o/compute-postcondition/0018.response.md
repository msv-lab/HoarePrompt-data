According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `right` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is equal to `n`, which means the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`, and `left` should be updated to reflect the number of times the loop has executed, which would be `left + 1`. 

Since `current_counts` is updated for `colors[right]`, we can assume that `colors` will need to account for the new value of `right`, which is now `n + 1`. 

State: **`current_counts` is updated for `colors[n + 1]`, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` is n + 1**
