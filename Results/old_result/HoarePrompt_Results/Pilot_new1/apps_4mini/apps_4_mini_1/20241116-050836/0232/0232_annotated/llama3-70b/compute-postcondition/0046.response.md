The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `i` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than `i + 2; `j` is equal to `i + 2; `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`; `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1; `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
