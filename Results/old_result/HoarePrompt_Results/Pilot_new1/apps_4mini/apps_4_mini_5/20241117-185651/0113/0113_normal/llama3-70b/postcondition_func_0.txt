The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input. It then finds the next multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n` by incrementing `n` until `n` is divisible by `10`. Finally, it prints the resulting value of `n`. The function does not return any value; it solely prints the modified `n`. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it remains unchanged.
