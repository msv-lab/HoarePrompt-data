The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) that is not a multiple of 10, the new value of `n` remains a positive integer and continues to satisfy the conditions given. The values of `k` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1; `k` is a non-negative integer; `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1; `k` is a non-negative integer; `x` is 10**
