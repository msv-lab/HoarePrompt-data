Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, and `n` is an integer such that n is less than 0 or greater than 9. If `n` is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is in the range of 10 to 99, if `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place for `n` from the `tens` list. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. If `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19, the function does not execute the if statement and no output is produced.***
