The function prompts the user for an integer input `s` and prints the English word representation of the number if it is between 0 and 99. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 20 and 99, it prints the word for the tens place from the `tens` list, followed by a hyphen and the word for the units place from the `ones` list if applicable. The function does not handle inputs outside the range of 0 to 99, nor does it return a value; it only prints the output.
