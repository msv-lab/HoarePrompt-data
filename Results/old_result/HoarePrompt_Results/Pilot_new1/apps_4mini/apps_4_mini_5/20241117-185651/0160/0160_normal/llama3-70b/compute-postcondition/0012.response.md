According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. The loop will execute if the range is valid, which means that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` must be at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `gcd` must be at least 1, and the loop variable `i` should start at 1.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
