The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is at least 1. The value of `i` is 1. Therefore, the maximum value between `max_divisor` (which is equal to `gcd` and at least 1) and `i` (which is 1) will either remain the same or be updated to `gcd`. The output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`**
