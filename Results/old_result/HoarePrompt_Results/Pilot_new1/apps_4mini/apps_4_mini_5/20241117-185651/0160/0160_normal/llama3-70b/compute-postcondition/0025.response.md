The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. The variable `max_divisor` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, which is also greater than or equal to 1 since `gcd` is at least 1. The exact values of `max_divisor` and `i` are not specified, but both are at least 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change in `max_divisor`.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is at least gcd, `i` is at least 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`.**
