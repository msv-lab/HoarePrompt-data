The code adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. The variable `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and since `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i`, `i` is a valid divisor of `x`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, but the `divisors` set is updated to include `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the inclusion of `i` in the `divisors` set.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` now includes `i`.**
