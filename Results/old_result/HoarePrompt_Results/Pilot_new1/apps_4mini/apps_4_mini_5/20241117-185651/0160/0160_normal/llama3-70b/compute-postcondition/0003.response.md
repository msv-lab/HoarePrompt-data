According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop starts from `i = 1` and continues until `i < N`. For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than 1. The variable `K`, `A`, and `gcd` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but `gcd` is initialized to `A[0]`, which implies that `A` must have at least one element.

For the loop to be executed, the necessary conditions are that `N` is greater than 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `K` is a non-negative integer, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is `A[0]`, `i` is 1**
