Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. If the product of `i` and `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is equal to 1, `max_divisor` remains unchanged since `i * i` will also not equal `gcd`.***
