The code adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. Since `divisors` is initially an empty set, it will now contain the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` contains the value of `i`, `x` is a positive integer (x >= 1), and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` contains the value of `i`, `x` is a positive integer (x >= 1), and `i` is 1**.
