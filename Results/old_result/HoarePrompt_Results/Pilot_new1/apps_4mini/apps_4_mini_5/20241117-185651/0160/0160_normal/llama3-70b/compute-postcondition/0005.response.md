According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and it must still be less than `N`. Therefore, `N` needs to remain greater than 2 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`N` is greater than 2, `K` is a non-negative integer, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), `i` is 2**
