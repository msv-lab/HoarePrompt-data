The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `gcd // i`. The value of `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Thus, `gcd // i` will yield a value that depends on the specific value of `gcd`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`**
