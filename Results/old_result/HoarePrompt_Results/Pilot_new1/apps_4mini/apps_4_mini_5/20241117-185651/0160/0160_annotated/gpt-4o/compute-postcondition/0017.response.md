The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is expected to be a list of integers `A`, where the length of `A` is `N`, an integer between 2 and 500. Each element in `A` is an integer between 1 and 10^6. Additionally, there are constraints on another parameter `K`, which is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of the divisors in descending order from the set `divisors`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of integers and return a sorted list of divisors in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and returns a sorted list of the divisors in descending order from the set divisors.**
