Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the divisors of `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `divisors` will remain an empty set. If `x` is 1, the loop will execute only once, adding 1 to `divisors`. If `x` is a prime number, the set will contain only 1 and `x`. If `x` is a perfect square, the set will include 1, `sqrt(x)`, and `x` as divisors. If `x` is composite, the set will contain all divisors of `x`.**
