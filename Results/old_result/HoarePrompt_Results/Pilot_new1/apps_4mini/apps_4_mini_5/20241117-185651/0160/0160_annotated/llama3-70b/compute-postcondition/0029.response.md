According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 9. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Given that `gcd` is at least 9, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 3. 

If `gcd` is exactly 9, then `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` equals 3, and `i` cannot increment further without exceeding this value. However, if `gcd` is greater than 9, then `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be greater than 3, allowing the loop to execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `gcd` must be greater than 9. In this case, `i` will increment to 4.

State: **`gcd` is greater than 9, `i` is 4**
