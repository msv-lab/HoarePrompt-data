The code initializes `divisors` as an empty set. The previous values of the variables `N`, `K`, and `A` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the initialization of `divisors`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers, each between 1 and 10^6; `divisors` is an empty set.**
