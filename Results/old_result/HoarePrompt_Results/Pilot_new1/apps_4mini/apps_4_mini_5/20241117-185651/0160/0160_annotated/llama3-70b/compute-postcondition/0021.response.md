The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `i` is 2, the expression `gcd // i` evaluates to `gcd // 2`. The value of `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, so `gcd // 2` will be at least 0. The previous value of `max_divisor` is not given, but it is being updated based on the maximum calculation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_divisor` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to max(max_divisor, gcd // 2)**
