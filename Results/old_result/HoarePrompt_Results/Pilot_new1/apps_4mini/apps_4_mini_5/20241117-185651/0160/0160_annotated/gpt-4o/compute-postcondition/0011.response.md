The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i`, which is 3, to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` is either an empty set or already contains elements, it will now include the value 3. The values of the other variables (`N`, `K`, `A`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` now includes the element 3.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` now includes the element 3.**
