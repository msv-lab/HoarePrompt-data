The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The initial state indicates that `x` is such that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `i - 1`, which means `i` is at least 1. Since `divisors` is a set, adding a value does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `x` is such that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `i`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `i` is added to the set `divisors`.**
