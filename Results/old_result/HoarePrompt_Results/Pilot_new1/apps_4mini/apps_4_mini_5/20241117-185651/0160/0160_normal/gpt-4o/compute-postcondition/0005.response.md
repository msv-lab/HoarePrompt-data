Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that includes `i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, and also includes `x // i` when `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `i` is 1, then `divisors` will include both 1 and `x`. There is no else part in the code.***
