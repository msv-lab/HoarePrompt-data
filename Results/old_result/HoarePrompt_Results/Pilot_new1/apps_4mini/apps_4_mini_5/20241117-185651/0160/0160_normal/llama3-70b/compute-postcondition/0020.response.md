The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value (which is `gcd` and is greater than or equal to 1) and `i` (which is 2). Therefore, `max_divisor` will be updated to the greater of `gcd` or 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_divisor` is either `gcd` or 2 (whichever is greater), `i` is 2**
