The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are not specified in the initial state but are defined within the context of `bus_routes`. Since `n` and `t` are positive integers within their respective ranges, `wait_time` will be calculated based on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. 

However, since `s_i` is derived from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is provided as a positive integer, the exact value of `wait_time` will depend on these specific values. The other variables (`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is derived from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a positive integer. `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.**
