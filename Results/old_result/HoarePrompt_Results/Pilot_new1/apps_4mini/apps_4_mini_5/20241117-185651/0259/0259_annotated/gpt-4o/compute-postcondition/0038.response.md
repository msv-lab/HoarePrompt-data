Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes, which is non-negative. `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route (1-indexed) that yields this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all bus routes have start times `s_i` less than `t` and none provide a wait time less than the initial `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` will still be float('inf') and `chosen_route` will remain -1.**
