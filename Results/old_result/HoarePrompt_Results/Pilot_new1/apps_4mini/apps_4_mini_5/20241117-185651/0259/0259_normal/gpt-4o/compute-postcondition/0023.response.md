Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. If `s_i` (derived from `bus_routes[i]`) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. If `t` is such that `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always non-negative. Throughout this process, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
