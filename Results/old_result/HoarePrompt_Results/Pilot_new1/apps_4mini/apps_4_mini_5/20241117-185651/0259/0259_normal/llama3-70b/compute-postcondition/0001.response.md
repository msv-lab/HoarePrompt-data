The code initializes an empty list called `buses`. The previous values of the affected variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `buses` is an empty list**
