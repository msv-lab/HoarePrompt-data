Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `i` is 1, and `(s, d)` is the second tuple in the buses list. If `time` calculated as (t - s) % d is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, no changes are made to `min_time` or `ans`.***
