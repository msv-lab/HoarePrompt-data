The `buses` list is modified by appending a new tuple `(s, d)` to it. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers provided at runtime. The initial state indicates that `buses` already contains one tuple, and now it will contain two tuples after the append operation. The states of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is now [(s, d), (s, d)] where the second `(s, d)` is the newly appended tuple.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is now [(s, d), (s, d)]**
