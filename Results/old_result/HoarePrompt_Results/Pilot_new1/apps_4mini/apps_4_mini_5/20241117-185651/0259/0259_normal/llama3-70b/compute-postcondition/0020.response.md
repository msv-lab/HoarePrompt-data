Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`, which is 1 in this case since `i` is 0. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
