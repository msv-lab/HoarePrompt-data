To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the variables and calculate the result step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100)
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000)
   - `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers.
   - `i` is 2, which means we are accessing the third tuple in `bus_routes` (index 2).
   - `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[2]`, so `s_i` is the first element and `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index 2.

2. **Calculating `wait_time`**:
   - The expression for `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
   - This calculates the wait time based on the current time `t`, the start time `s_i`, and the duration `d_i`.

3. **Variables Affected**:
   - `wait_time` is the only variable being assigned a new value based on the current values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`.

Since we do not have specific values for `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, we cannot compute a numerical result for `wait_time`, but we can express it in terms of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of bus_routes[2], `d_i` is the second element of bus_routes[2], and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
