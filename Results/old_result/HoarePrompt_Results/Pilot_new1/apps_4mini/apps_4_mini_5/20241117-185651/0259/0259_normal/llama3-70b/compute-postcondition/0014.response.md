The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous state of the variable does not affect the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list of tuples containing pairs of integers inputted by the user, `min_time` is set to positive infinity, and `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list of tuples containing pairs of integers inputted by the user, `min_time` is set to positive infinity, and `ans` is -1**
