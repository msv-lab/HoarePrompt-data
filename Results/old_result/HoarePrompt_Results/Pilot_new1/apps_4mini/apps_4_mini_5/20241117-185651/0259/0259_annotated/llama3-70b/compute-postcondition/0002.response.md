According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `buses` is an empty list, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop does not depend on the contents of `buses`. The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it can be initialized without needing a specific value.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the states can remain as they are, with `n` being a positive integer and `_` starting at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
