The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous states of the variables `buses` and `min_time` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, where `n` is 0 or more; `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, where `n` is 0 or more; `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1**
