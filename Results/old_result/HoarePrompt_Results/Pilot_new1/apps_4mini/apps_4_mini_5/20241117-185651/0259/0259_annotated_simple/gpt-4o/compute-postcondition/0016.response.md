Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the original `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the current route being evaluated. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This encompasses all scenarios regarding the comparison of `wait_time` and `min_wait_time`, ensuring that the chosen route reflects the route with the minimum wait time.***
