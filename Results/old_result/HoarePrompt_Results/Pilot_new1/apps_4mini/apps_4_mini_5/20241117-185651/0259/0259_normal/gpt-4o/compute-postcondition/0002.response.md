According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 before the first iteration of the loop. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
