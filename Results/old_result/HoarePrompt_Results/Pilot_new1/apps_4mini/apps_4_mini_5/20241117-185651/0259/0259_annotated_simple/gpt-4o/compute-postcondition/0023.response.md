Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, if `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`.***
