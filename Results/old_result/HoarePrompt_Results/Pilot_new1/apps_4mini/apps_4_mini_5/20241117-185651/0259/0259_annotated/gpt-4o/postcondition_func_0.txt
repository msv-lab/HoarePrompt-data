The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the start time and the frequency of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for a bus that can be taken after time `t` and returns the 1-indexed index of the bus route with the shortest wait time. If no suitable bus route is found (i.e., all routes have start times less than `t` and do not provide a wait time less than the initial value), it returns -1.
