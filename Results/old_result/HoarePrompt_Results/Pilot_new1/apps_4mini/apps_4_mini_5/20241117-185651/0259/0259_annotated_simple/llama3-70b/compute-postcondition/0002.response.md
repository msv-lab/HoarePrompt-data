According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `buses` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself. The variable `_` is commonly used as a throwaway variable in Python and does not need to be tracked for the loop's execution. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value within its defined range, which it already is. The loop will start with `_` initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is 0, `buses` is an empty list**
