The values of `s` and `d` are assigned based on the input received from the user, where `input()` accepts two space-separated integers, and `map(int, input().split())` converts them into integers. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected by this operation, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `s` and `d` are now assigned values based on user input, while the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**.
