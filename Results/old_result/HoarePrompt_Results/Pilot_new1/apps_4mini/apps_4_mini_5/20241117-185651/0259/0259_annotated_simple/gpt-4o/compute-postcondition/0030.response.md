The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the newly assigned value of `wait_time` while the other variables maintain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is 0**
