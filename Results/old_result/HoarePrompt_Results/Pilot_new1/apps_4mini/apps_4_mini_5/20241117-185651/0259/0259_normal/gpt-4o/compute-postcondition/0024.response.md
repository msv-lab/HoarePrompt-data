The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous values of `min_wait_time` and `wait_time` are not provided, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know that `min_wait_time` now holds the value of `wait_time`. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`**.
