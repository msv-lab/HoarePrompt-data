According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `n` greater than `i + 1`, which means `i` is currently less than `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop is structured as `for i in range(n)`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Thus, `i` will now be equal to `i + 1`, which is still less than `n`. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it does not need to be adjusted for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be updated to `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
