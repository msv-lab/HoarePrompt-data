Given the initial state, we analyze the impact of the code snippet.

1. The code calculates `dist3` as `abs(0 - min_pos)`. 
2. The value of `min_pos` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value.
3. The calculation of `dist3` depends on `min_pos`, which is unknown, but it will be the absolute difference between `0` and `min_pos`.

Since `min_pos` is not defined in the initial state, the output state will reflect that `dist3` is calculated based on an unknown `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos), and `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos) where `min_pos` is unknown.**
