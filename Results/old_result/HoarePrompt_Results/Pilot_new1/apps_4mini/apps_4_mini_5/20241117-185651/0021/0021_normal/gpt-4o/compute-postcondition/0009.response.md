The code prints the value of `max_distance`. The value of `max_distance` is determined by the maximum of the distances `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The other variables are not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos), `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos), `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos), and `max_distance` is the maximum of (dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4) and the function prints `max_distance`.**
