The variable `a` is assigned a new value, which is a list created from the input of distinct integers. The previous value of `a` is not specified, but it will be replaced by the new list generated from the input. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, which suggests that the input will consist of `n` distinct integers. Therefore, after execution, `a` will contain the integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input**
