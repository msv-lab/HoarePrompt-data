The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, which contains all integers from 1 to `n`. 

The function's output is not explicitly provided, but based on the constraints and relationships, we can infer that it likely processes the list `a` in relation to the integer `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` (of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`).**
