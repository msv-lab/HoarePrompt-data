To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n after performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` distinct integers.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum element (`1`) and the maximum element (`n`) using the `index` method.
3. It calculates four potential distances:
   - Distance from the minimum element to the start (position 0).
   - Distance from the maximum element to the start (position 0).
   - Distance from the minimum element to the end (position n-1).
   - Distance from the maximum element to the end (position n-1).
4. It then takes the maximum of these four distances and prints it.

### Issues Identified:
The program does not account for the fact that it must perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance. It only calculates potential distances without ensuring that the swap actually results in moving the minimum and maximum elements to the positions that yield the maximum distance.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- The minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (5) is at index 4. 
- The current distance is `|0 - 4| = 4`, which is already the maximum distance.
- If we swap 1 and 5, the distance would remain the same, but the program does not need to perform a swap when the distance is already maximized.

However, if we consider the input:
```
5
2 1 3 4 5
```
- The minimum (1) is at index 1 and the maximum (5) is at index 4.
- The distances calculated would be:
  - From 1 to start: `|1 - 0| = 1`
  - From 5 to start: `|4 - 0| = 4`
  - From 1 to end: `|1 - 4| = 3`
  - From 5 to end: `|4 - 4| = 0`
  
The maximum distance calculated would be `4`, but the program does not consider that after a swap, the maximum distance could potentially be `3` instead of `4` depending on the swap.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that the swap is accounted for in maximizing the distance between 1 and n. It does not correctly handle all cases where the distance could be maximized after a swap. 

Thus, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.
