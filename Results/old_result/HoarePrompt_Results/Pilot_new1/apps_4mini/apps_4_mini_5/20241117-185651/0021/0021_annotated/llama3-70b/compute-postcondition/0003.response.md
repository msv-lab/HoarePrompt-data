The code assigns `posn` the value of `a.index(n)`, which returns the index of the value `n` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`, the value of `n` is guaranteed to be present in the list. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `a`, and `pos1`. The output state will reflect the index of `n` in the list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`**.
