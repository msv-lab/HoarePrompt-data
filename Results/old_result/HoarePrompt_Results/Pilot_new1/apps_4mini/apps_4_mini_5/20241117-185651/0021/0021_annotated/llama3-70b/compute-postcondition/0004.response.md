To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. **Understanding the variables:**
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`.
   - `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`.

2. **Analyzing the code:**
   - The code calculates `max_dist` using the formula:
     \[
     max\_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     \]
   - This means we need to evaluate two expressions:
     - `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`: This gives the distance between the positions of `1` and `n`, subtracting 1.
     - `n - 2`: This represents the maximum possible distance between any two elements in the list, considering the range of indices from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Output State:**
   - The output state will reflect the calculated value of `max_dist` based on the values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`.
   - Since the exact values of `pos1` and `posn` depend on the specific permutation in `a`, we denote them generically.

Thus, the output state will describe the relationship and the calculated maximum distance based on the initial variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
