The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. Given that `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, the calculation for `dist2` involves finding the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `max_pos`, and `dist1` (which is equal to `max_pos`).

Since `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, we can conclude that `dist2` will be calculated based on the specific values of `n` and `max_pos`. The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `max_pos`, and the newly calculated `dist2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is `max_pos`, and `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
