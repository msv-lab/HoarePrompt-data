The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `n`, the value of `pos1` will be the position of `1` in that list. The value of `n` does not change, and the list `a` remains the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the position of `1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`**
