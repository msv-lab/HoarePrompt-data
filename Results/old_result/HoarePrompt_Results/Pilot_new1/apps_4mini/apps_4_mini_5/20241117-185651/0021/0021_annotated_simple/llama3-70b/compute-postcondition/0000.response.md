The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the previous value of `n` is unknown but constrained to be between 2 and 100. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers**
