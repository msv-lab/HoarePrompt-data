To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

1. The `min_dist` variable is already defined based on the formula provided in the initial state. Its value is determined by the expression `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, but we don't have specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, or `n`, so we cannot compute a numeric value for `min_dist`.
2. The `max_dist` variable is referenced in the `max` function, but its value is also unknown from the initial state.
3. The expression `n - 1 - min_dist` involves `n` and `min_dist`, but without specific values, we cannot compute it either.
4. The `print` function will output the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`, but since we do not know the values of `max_dist`, `n`, or `min_dist`, we cannot determine a specific output.

Since the output depends on values that are not provided, we can only state the relationship between the variables.

Output State: **`min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the output is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**
