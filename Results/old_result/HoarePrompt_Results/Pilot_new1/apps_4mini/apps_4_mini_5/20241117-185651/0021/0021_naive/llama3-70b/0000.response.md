To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Nicholas has a permutation of size `n` containing distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
2. He wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap.
3. The output should be the maximum possible distance after the swap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)
posn = a.index(n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

### Key Points:
- The program identifies the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.
- It calculates `max_dist` as the maximum of the current distance minus one and `n - 2`.
- It calculates `min_dist` as the minimum of the current distance minus one and `n - 2`.
- Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Distance:**
   - The logic for calculating `max_dist` and `min_dist` is flawed. The distance between the minimum and maximum elements should be directly calculated based on their positions after considering the swap.
   - The program does not correctly consider the scenarios where the maximum possible distance is achieved by swapping the elements at the ends of the list.

2. **Example Case:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     2 1 3 4
     ```
   - The positions of 1 and 4 are `1` and `3`, respectively. The current distance is `2`. The maximum distance after one swap should be `3` (by swapping 1 with 4).
   - However, the program will calculate `max_dist` and `min_dist` incorrectly and will not yield the correct maximum distance.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic and the incorrect handling of certain cases, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
