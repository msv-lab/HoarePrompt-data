Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, and the program prints `max_distance`.**
