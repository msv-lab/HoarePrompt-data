The variable `dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`, which calculates the absolute distance from index 0 to the position of the value 1 in the list `a`. The value of `min_pos` is known from the initial state. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, and `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, and `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`**.
