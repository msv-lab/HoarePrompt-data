The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be in the range from 2 to 100. The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the permutation provided in `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` in the range from 2 to 100 and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.**
