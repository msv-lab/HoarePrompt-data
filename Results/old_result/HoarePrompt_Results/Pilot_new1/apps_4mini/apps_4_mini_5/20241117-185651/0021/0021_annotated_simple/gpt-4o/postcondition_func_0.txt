The function accepts an integer `n` (expected to be in the range from 2 to 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from either end of the list (index 0 or index n-1) to the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, and prints this maximum distance. Note that if `1` or `n` are not present in the list, the function will raise a ValueError due to the use of `index()` method.
