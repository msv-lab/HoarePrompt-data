The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any specific output described in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `x` and `y` that meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, both integers, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
