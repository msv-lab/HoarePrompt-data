The function reads two integers, x and y, from input, calculates the expression ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2), and prints the result. It does not return any value, and it assumes that the values of x and y satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The printed result represents the number of steps required to equalize x and y, considering both the even and odd differences.
