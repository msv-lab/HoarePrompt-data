The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any values, as there is no output specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `x` and `y` that meet the specified constraints, but it does not provide any return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, both integers, with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but does not return any value.**
