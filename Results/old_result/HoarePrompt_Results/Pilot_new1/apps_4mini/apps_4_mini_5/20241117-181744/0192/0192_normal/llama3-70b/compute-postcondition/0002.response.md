The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided definition. However, it operates under the constraint that `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the conditions 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. The output of the function is not specified in the prompt, so we cannot determine the return value or any specific cases. 

Given the constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. The specific return value is not provided.**
