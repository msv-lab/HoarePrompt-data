To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program logic.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We start with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
2. We want to reduce the side length to `y` while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides must remain positive integers).
3. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Program Logic:
The provided program calculates the number of seconds needed to change the triangle's side length from `x` to `y` using the formula:
```python
(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2
```
This formula essentially computes how many operations are needed to reduce the side length. Let's break it down:
- `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of full 2-unit reductions we can make.
- `(x - y) % 2` accounts for an additional operation if there is an odd difference.

### Edge Cases:
We need to ensure that the program handles all possible scenarios correctly:
- The minimum value for `x` is 4 (as `y` must be at least 3 and less than `x`).
- The maximum value for `x` is 100,000.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `x = 6`, `y = 3`
   - Expected output: `4` (as shown in the example).
   - Calculation: `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Incorrect).

2. **Test Case 2:** `x = 8`, `y = 5`
   - Expected output: `3` (as shown in the example).
   - Calculation: `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Incorrect).

3. **Test Case 3:** `x = 22`, `y = 4`
   - Expected output: `6` (as shown in the example).
   - Calculation: `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9` (Incorrect).

### Conclusion:
In all tested cases, the program fails to produce the correct output. The calculations do not account for the necessary operations to ensure that all sides remain positive integers and do not correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
