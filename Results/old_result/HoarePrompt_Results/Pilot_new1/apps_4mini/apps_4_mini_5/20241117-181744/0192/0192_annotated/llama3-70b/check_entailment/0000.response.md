The provided code is supposed to calculate the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from a triangle of side length `x`. The requirement is that during the operation, the triangle must remain non-degenerate, meaning that the lengths of the sides must always satisfy the triangle inequality.

The code currently implemented is as follows:

```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
```

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers `x` and `y`. However, the annotations mention that there are no constraints enforced on the values of `x` and `y`, which is an issue since the problem states specific constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000).

2. **Logic**: The core logic of the function computes the absolute difference `abs(x - y)`. This value represents the number of seconds needed to change the side length from `x` to `y`. However, the problem requires ensuring that at no point do the side lengths become invalid for a triangle. The logic does not take into account the intermediate steps required to maintain the triangle's validity (non-degenerate condition).

3. **Examples**: Let's consider the provided examples:
   - For the input `6 3`, the expected output is `4`. The transitions `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)` indeed take 4 seconds. The code outputs `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which is incorrect.
   - For the input `8 5`, the expected output is `3`. The transitions can be shown to take 3 seconds, but again the code outputs `abs(8 - 5) = 3`, which is correct in this case, but the reasoning is flawed.
   - For the input `22 4`, the expected output is `6`, but the code outputs `abs(22 - 4) = 18`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The code does not correctly handle the problem as described. It fails to enforce the non-degenerate triangle condition throughout the modification process and does not account for the necessary intermediate steps to reach the target triangle side length `y`. The annotations also point out that the function does not enforce the constraints on `x` and `y`, which is critical to the problem.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
