Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`. 

The program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `abs(x - y)`, which does not take into account the constraints of maintaining a non-degenerate triangle throughout the modifications. 

For example, if we take the input `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the expected output is `4`, as shown in the problem description. However, the program would output `abs(6 - 3)`, which is `3`, failing to account for the necessary intermediate steps required to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate.

Another example is with `x = 8` and `y = 5`. The expected output is `3`, but the program would again incorrectly output `3` without considering the steps needed to maintain the triangle's properties.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, confirming that it is incorrect.
