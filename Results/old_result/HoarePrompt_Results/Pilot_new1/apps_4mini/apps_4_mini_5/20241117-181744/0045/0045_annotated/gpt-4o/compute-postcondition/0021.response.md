The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is `k - 1`, and since `sequence` is an array, the value at index `i` is increased by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence[k - 2]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[k - 2]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.
