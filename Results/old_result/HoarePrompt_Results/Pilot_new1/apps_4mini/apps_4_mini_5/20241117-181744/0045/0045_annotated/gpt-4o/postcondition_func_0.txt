The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum required sum of the first `k` natural numbers. If this sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. If the sum is less than or equal to `n`, it generates a sequence of `k` integers that starts with `d` (where `d` is the number of times the minimum sum can fit into `n`) and increments the last `min(remainder, k)` elements of the sequence by 1, where `remainder` is the leftover after fitting the minimum sum into `n`. The function ultimately returns this modified sequence.
