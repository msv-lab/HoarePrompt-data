The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if the minimum required sum, calculated as `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum required sum exceeds the available value of `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, implying that `n` is sufficient to meet the minimum sum requirement.

In Case 2, the function returns a modified list `sequence` after potentially increasing its last elements based on the value of `remainder`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if `n` is sufficient to meet the minimum sum requirement, and return -1 if it is not. If `n` is sufficient, it may return a modified list `sequence` based on the value of `remainder`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns -1 if the minimum required sum exceeds `n`. If `n` is sufficient, it returns a modified list `sequence`.**
