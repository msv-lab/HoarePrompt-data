According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, which means `i` will become `k - 3`. 

Additionally, since the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, the value of `k` must remain unchanged, and the `sequence` array does not need further adjustments based on the given conditions. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` is now `k - 3`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
