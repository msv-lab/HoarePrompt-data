Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum required sum exceeds the available value `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return a value, implying that further processing may occur beyond this fragment.***
