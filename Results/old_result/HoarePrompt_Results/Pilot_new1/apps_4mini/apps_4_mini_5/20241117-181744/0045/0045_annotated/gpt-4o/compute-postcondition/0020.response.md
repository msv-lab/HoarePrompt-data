Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[k - 2]` is incremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 1`. If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no change occurs in the state of the program.***
