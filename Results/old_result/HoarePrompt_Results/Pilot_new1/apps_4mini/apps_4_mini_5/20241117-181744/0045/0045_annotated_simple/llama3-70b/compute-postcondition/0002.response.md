The code `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment. The value of `a` is updated to the current value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. 

In the initial state, `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is greater than 1. Therefore, after the execution of the code:

- `a` takes the value of `b`.
- `b` becomes `a % b`. Since `a` was previously assigned the value of `b`, `a % b` will yield `0` (as any number modulo itself is 0).

Thus, the output state reflects these changes:

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is 0**
