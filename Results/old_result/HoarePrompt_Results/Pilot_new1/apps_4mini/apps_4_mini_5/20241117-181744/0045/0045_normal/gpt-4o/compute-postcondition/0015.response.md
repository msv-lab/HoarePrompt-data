Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer. If `remainder` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the conditions for continuing the loop are no longer met. If `remainder` is not zero, the loop continues to execute until `remainder` becomes zero, at which point the program will also break out of the loop. The state of `sequence[i]` is updated by increasing it by 1, where `i` is `k - 1`, and `remainder` has been decreased by 1 prior to this check. The overall state ensures that the loop only continues while `remainder` is non-zero.***
