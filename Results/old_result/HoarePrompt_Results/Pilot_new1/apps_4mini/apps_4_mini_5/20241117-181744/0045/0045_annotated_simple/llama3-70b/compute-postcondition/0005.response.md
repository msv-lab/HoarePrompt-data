According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will only execute if `b` is true (non-zero). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value.

State: **`a` is 1, `b` is greater than 0**
