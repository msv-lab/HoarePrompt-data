In the provided code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped and updated simultaneously. Initially, `a` is equal to `b`, which is 1. The operation `a % b` calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Since `a` is 1 and `b` is also 1, the result of `a % b` is 0. 

Thus, after executing the line `a, b = b, a % b`, we have:
- `a` takes the value of `b`, which is 1.
- `b` takes the value of `a % b`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is 1, `b` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 0**
