Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros (or '0' if originally empty), `b` retains its original value from `data[1]`, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` has the same length as `b`, then the output is determined by the lexicographical comparison: if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All cases are covered, including the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal. The list `data` remains unchanged.***
