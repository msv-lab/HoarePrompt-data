The code snippet prints the character `'>'`, and does not change the values of the variables `a` or `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the output includes the printed character.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; the output is '>'**
