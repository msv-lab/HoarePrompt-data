The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The value of `data[1]` is not specified in the initial state, but it is a non-negative integer represented as a string. Therefore, `b` will be the string value of `data[1]` without any leading zeros. The variable `a` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros; `data` is a list of substrings.**
