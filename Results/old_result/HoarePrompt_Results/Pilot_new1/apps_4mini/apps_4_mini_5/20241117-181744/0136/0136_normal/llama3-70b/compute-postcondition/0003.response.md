The code prints the string `'='`, which does not affect the values of the variables `a` and `b`. Since `a` is equal to `b`, both variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, and the output is `'='`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, and the output is '='**
