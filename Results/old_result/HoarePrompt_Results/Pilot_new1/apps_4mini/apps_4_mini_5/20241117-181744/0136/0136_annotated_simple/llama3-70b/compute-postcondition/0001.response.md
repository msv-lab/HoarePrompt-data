The value of `b` is assigned the result of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it will take the input string and remove any leading zeroes. The variable `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `b` after removing leading zeroes, while `a` retains its original value.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string without leading zeroes**
