The code assigns `b` the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed by the `lstrip('0')` method. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The value of `data[1]` is unknown, but after applying `lstrip('0')`, `b` will hold a string representation of the integer value of `data[1]` without leading zeros. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `a` and the modified value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros**
