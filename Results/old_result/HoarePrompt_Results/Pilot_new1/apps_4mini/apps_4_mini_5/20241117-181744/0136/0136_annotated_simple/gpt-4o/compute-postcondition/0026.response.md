The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes and have a length of no more than \(10^6\) characters. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the constraints, we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and it may perform operations on these strings. However, the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
