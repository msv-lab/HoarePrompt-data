The provided Python program aims to compare two very long integers represented as strings, handling leading zeros appropriately. The code reads the input, removes leading zeros, and then compares the two integers based on their lengths and values.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program reads two non-negative integers as strings from input.
2. It removes leading zeros from both integers.
3. It checks if either string is empty after removing leading zeros and assigns '0' if so.
4. It compares the lengths of the two strings to determine which integer is larger.
5. If the lengths are equal, it compares the strings lexicographically.
6. It prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the case where both inputs are '0' (leading to an empty string after stripping zeros).
- It also handles cases where one number has leading zeros and the other does not, as shown in the examples.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function reads the integers, removes leading zeros, and compares them, which aligns with the code's functionality. The hints also specify the expected outputs for various test cases, which match what the code would produce.

### Potential Issues:
- The code does not handle the case where both inputs are empty strings. Although the problem description states that the inputs will be non-negative integers, it does not explicitly rule out the possibility of receiving empty input lines. If both lines are empty, `data` would be an empty list, leading to an IndexError when trying to access `data[0]` and `data[1]`.
- The code does not account for the case where a user might input only whitespace, which would also lead to an IndexError.

### Conclusion:
The code works correctly for valid inputs as described in the problem statement but does not handle the edge case of receiving empty input lines or only whitespace, leading to a potential crash. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement to handle every potential case correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
