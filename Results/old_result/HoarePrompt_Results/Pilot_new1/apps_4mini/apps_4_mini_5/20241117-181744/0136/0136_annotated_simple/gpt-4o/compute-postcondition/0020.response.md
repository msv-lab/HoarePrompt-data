Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros, which is '0' if it was initially empty. `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and if `b` was initially empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.***
