The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation, as they are separate input integers. The output state reflects that `s` now contains a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input.**
