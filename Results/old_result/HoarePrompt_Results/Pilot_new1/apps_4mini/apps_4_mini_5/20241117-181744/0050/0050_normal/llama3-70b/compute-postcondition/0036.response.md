Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
