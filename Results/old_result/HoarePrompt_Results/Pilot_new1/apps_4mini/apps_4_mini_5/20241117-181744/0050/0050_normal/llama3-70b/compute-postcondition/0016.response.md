The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `i` is 1, `shares` is unchanged at 0, `r` retains its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
