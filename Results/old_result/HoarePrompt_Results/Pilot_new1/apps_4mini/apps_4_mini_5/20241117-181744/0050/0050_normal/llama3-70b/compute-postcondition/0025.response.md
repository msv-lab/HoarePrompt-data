According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Additionally, the conditions regarding `n` and `r` affect the overall state before the loop begins. Specifically, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `r` must be sufficient (greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`). 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `r` must be greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`,
- `i` should be initialized to 0 as it starts counting from 0 in the range of `m`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0**
