According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure that the loop can continue. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be updated to 3.
- `n` should be updated to be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `i` is 3**
