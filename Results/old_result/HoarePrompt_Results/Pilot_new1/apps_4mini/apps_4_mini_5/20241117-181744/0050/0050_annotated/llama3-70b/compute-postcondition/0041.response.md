Postcondition: ***If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r` at least as large as the smallest value in `s` and ensuring that `i` remains less than `m` (specifically, `i` is the current value + 1).***
