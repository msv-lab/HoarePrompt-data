`b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `input().split()`, which splits the input string into separate values and converts each of them to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation, as `b` is a new variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `b` based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input**.
