The variable `max_shares` is assigned the value of `r // min_buy_price`, where `r` is the total amount of money available for buying shares and `min_buy_price` is the minimum price of the shares from the list `s`. Since `r` and `min_buy_price` are integers based on user input and `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`, we can calculate `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_sell_price` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers based on user input; `s` is a list of integers based on user input; `b` is a list of integers based on user input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.**
