According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. Therefore, `i` can be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can continue.

No other states need to be adjusted since `r` and `shares` are not directly relevant to whether the loop will execute again, based on the provided information.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `i` is 1, `shares` is unchanged at 0, `r` retains its original value**
