The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sort operation. The state of the list `s` will change to its sorted version, but the specific values of `s` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a list of integers from input**
