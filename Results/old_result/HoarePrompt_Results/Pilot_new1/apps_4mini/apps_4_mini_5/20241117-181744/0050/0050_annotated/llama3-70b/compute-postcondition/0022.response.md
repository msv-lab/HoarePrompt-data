Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is sorted in reverse order, `i` is 2. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` when divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
