The code multiplies `denominator` by `total_days` and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `total_days` is given as 2, and since the initial state does not specify the value of `denominator`, we cannot determine its new value after the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation without specific values for `denominator`.

Output State: **`denominator` is multiplied by 2 and taken modulo `MOD`**
