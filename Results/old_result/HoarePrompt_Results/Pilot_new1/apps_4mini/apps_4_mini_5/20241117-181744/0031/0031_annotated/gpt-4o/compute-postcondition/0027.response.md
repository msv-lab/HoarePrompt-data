The code prints the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`. The values of `A` and `B` have been updated previously to `A // g` and `B // g`, where `g` is the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`. Since no specific values for `A`, `B`, or `MOD` are provided, we cannot determine the exact outputs of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current status of the variables without specific numeric results.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either 1 or the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1 modulo MOD; `p_total` is the value of denominator; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is updated to B // g; `g` is the value returned by func_1(A, B); and the function prints (A % MOD, B % MOD)**
