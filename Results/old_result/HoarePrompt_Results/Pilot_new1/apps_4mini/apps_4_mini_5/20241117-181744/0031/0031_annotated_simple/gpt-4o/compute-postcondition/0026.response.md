The value of `B` is updated by performing integer division with `g`. The previous value of `B` is equal to `p_total`, and `g` has been assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`. Therefore, after executing `B //= g`, the new value of `B` will be `p_total // g`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is modified to `A // g`, `B` is now `p_total // g`, and `g` is the value returned by func_1(A, B)**
