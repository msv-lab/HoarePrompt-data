The value of `numerator` is updated by performing an integer division with `gcd`. The previous value of `numerator` is not specified, but it is reduced by a factor of `gcd`. The variable `denominator` remains unchanged, and `gcd` is not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `numerator` has been updated, while `denominator` and `gcd` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`numerator` is the previous value divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is equal to `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the previous numerator and denominator.**
