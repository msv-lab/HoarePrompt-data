To evaluate the impact of the code, we consider the two scenarios based on the value of `k`:

1. If `k` is 2, then `numerator` is 2 and `denominator` is 4.
   - The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 2 and 4 is 2.

2. If `k` is greater than 2, then `numerator` is 0 and `denominator` is 8.
   - The gcd of 0 and 8 is 8.

Since the value of `k` determines which scenario applies, we can summarize the output state for both cases:

Output State: **If `k` is 2 then `gcd` is 2; if `k` is greater than 2 then `gcd` is 8.**
