The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is \(2^n\). Therefore, after executing the line of code, the new value of `denominator` will be \((1 * (2^n)) \% MOD\), which simplifies to \((2^n) \% MOD\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \((2^n) \% MOD\), `denominator` is \((2^n) \% MOD\), `i` is 0**
