The variable `denominator` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1**
