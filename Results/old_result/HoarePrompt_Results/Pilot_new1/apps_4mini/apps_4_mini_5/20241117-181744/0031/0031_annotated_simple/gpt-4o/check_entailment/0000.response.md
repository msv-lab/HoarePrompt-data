To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to calculate the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday among `2^n` days given `k` people.
- If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the output should be `1 1` since it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday.
- If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, we need to compute the irreducible fraction of the probability that at least two people share a birthday.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function for GCD (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function computes the GCD of two numbers. It is correctly implemented and will be used later to reduce the fraction.

2. **Main Logic (`func_2`)**:
   - The program checks if `k > 2^n`. If true, it prints `1 1`, which is correct.
   - It initializes `total_days` as `2^n`, `numerator` as `1`, and `denominator` as `1`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `k` times to calculate the numerator and denominator for the probability of no shared birthdays.
   - After the loop, it computes the probability of shared birthdays and assigns `A` and `B` accordingly.
   - Finally, it reduces `A` and `B` by their GCD and prints the results modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when `k = 2` and `n = 1`**: 
  - Here, `2^1 = 2` days and `k = 2`. The probability of sharing a birthday is `1/2`, which should yield `1 2` (but the program will yield `1 1` because it checks `k > 2^n`).
  
- **Case when `k = 3` and `n = 1`**: 
  - Here, `2^1 = 2` days and `k = 3`. The output should be `1 1` as it is guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday, which is handled correctly.

- **General Case**: 
  - When `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the calculations should yield the correct irreducible fraction. However, the loop's logic to compute the probability of no shared birthdays must be examined closely to ensure it handles all values correctly, especially as `k` approaches `2^n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case when `k = 2` and `n = 1`, where it should output `1 2` but instead outputs `1 1`. Thus, there is at least one input where the program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
