According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0. Since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `k`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes properly, we need to adjust the state to include the initial value of `i`, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
