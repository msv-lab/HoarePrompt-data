According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not change with the loop iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \((2^n) \% MOD\), `denominator` is \((2^n) \% MOD\), `i` is 1**
