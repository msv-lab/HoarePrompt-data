To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and see if it handles all edge cases correctly.

### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem requires calculating the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Guaranteed Collision**: If \( k > 2^n \), it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. Thus, the output should be \( 1, 1 \).
2. **Probability Calculation**: The probability of no two people sharing a birthday should be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   P(\text{no shared birthdays}) = \frac{(2^n)(2^n-1)(2^n-2)...(2^n-k+1)}{(2^n)^k}
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   P(\text{at least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\text{no shared birthdays})
   \]

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not handle the case where \( k > 2^n \). In such cases, the program should directly return \( 1, 1 \) instead of attempting to calculate the probabilities.
- The `math.gcd` function is used incorrectly. The GCD should be calculated between the numerator and denominator after they have been computed, not before. This could lead to incorrect results.
- The code does not check for the case when \( k = 1 \), which should also yield \( 0, 1 \) since there can't be a shared birthday with only one person.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
3 9
```
Here \( n = 3 \) implies \( 2^n = 8 \) days, but \( k = 9 \) people. The expected output should be \( 1, 1 \) because it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday. However, the provided code will attempt to compute the probability and will not handle this case correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the identified issues, the program does not cover all potential cases correctly as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
