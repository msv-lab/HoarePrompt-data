The provided program aims to calculate the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday among `k` people in a year with `2^n` days. The output should be the irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where `A` and `B` are coprime, and both values are returned modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Initial Assessment of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` and `k` and defines a function `func_1` to compute the required values.
2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - It calculates the total number of days as \( 2^n \).
   - It initializes `numerator` and `denominator` to 1.
   - It iterates `k` times to compute the numerator as the product of `total_days - i` and the denominator as the product of `total_days`.
   - It then computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction.
   - Finally, it returns both values modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases:
- **When `k > total_days`**: The program is expected to handle this case correctly by setting the numerator to 0, indicating that it is guaranteed at least two people share a birthday. This is consistent with the problem description.
- **Very large values of `n` and `k`**: Given \( n \) and \( k \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), the calculations of \( 2^n \) and the products in the loop could lead to overflow or excessive computation time. However, since Python handles large integers and the problem states to return results modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \), this should be manageable if implemented correctly.
- **When \( k = 2 \)**: The simplest case where the probability is straightforward to compute, and the results should be valid.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints state that the function correctly calculates the numerator and denominator based on the total number of days and returns the simplified values modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \). The hints also correctly identify that when `k` exceeds `total_days`, the numerator should be 0.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases. The handling of edge cases, especially where `k` exceeds `total_days`, is consistent with the expected behavior. The output hints align with the code's logic and expected results.

Correctness: **True**.
