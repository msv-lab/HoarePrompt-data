Output State: **`numerator` is equal to the product of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, `denominator` is equal to `total_days` raised to the power of `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1 and `denominator` remains 1.**
