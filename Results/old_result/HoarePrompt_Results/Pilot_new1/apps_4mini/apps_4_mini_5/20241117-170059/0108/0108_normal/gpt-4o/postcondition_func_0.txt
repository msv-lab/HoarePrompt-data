The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') in order. If `s` contains all the letters in sequence, it prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, and it may lead to an error if the variable `target` is not defined correctly. Additionally, if `s` is empty or does not contain any letters from 'a' to 'z', it will also print -1.
