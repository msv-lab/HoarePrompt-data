The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. The initial value of `s` is 'b', and `char` is also 'b'. The ASCII value of 'b' is 98, and the next character is 'c' (ASCII value 99). The `replace` method will replace the first 'b' in `s` with 'c'.

After executing the code, `s` becomes 'c', while `res` and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 'c', `res` is 'azab', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `res` is 'azab', `char` is 'b'**
