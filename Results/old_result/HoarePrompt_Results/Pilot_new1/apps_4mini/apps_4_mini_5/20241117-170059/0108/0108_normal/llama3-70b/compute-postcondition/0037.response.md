Output State: **`res` will be a string consisting of the characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, with each character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence as the loop progresses. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string. If `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will execute for each character in `alphabet`, replacing occurrences of each character in `s` with the next character in the ASCII sequence until no more occurrences are found.**
