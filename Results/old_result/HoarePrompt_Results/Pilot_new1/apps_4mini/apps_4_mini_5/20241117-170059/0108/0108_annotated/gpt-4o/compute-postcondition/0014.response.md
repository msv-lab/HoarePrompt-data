Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is less than 26, and `i` is less than len(s) - 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of the target, then `j` is increased by 1. If the characters do not match, `j` remains unchanged.***
