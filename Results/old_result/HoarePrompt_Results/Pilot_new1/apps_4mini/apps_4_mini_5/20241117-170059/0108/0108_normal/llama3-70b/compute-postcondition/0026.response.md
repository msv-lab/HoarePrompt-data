The code snippet `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the string `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after that last character. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will include one additional character, which is `char`.

The states of the other variables (`s` and `char`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is a string consisting of the characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s` plus `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character processed.**
