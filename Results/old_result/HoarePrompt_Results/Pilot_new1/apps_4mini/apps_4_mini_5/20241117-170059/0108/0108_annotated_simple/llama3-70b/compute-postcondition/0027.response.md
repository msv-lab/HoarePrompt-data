The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the ASCII table. The initial value of `s` is 'z', and `char` is also 'z'. 

1. `ord(char)` gives the ASCII value of 'z', which is 122.
2. `chr(ord(char) + 1)` computes the character corresponding to 123, which is '{'.
3. The `replace` method replaces the first occurrence of 'z' in `s` with '{'.

After executing the code, `s` changes from 'z' to '{', while `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'axz', `s` is '{', and `char` is 'z'.

Output State: **`res` is 'axz', `s` is '{', `char` is 'z'**
