To determine the necessary adjustments to the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. The loop iterates over `char` in `alphabet`. For the loop to execute again, the next character in `alphabet` must be available.
2. The state indicates that if `char` is in `s`, then `res` has been updated based on the characters in `s` and the occurrences of `char`.
3. The loop continues replacing occurrences of `char` in `s` with the next character in the alphabet until `char` is no longer found in `s`.

Given that `s` has already had the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `char` is still present in `s` for the loop to execute again.

Since `s` will be modified during each iteration, we must also account for the next character in `alphabet`. If `char` is still present in `s`, the next iteration will use the next character in `alphabet`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `char` should be the next character in `alphabet` after the current `char`.
- `s` must still contain `char` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`if char is in s then res` will be a string consisting of the characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s` plus all occurrences of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `s` contains `char`**
