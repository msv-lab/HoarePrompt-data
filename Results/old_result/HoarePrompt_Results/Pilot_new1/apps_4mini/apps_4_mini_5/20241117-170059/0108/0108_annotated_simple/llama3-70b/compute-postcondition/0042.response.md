Postcondition: ***`res` is a string containing all characters from 'a' to 'z' with each character replaced by the next one in the alphabet, and `s` is modified accordingly. If `res` contains exactly 26 characters, the function prints `res`. If `res` does not contain 26 characters, indicating that `s` does not have all letters from 'a' to 'z', the function prints -1. If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` remains an empty string and `s` is unchanged, and the function prints -1.***
