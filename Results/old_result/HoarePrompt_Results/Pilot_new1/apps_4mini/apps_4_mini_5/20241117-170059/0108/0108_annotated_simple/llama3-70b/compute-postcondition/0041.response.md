The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of `res` and `s` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all characters from `s`, each character replaced by the next one in the alphabet, maintaining their original count; `s` is modified accordingly; `res` is not equal to 26 characters, indicating that `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` remains an empty string and `s` is unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains all characters from `s`, each character replaced by the next one in the alphabet, maintaining their original count; `s` is modified accordingly; `res` is not equal to 26 characters, indicating that `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` remains an empty string and `s` is unchanged, and the function prints -1.**
