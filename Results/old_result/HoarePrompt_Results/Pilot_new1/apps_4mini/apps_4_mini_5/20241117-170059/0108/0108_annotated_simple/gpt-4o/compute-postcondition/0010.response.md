Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `len(s)` is greater than 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If there is no match, `j` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `j` is 1, then `target_len` must be greater than 1.***
