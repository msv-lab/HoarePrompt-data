The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` was initially 0, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to the character at index `j` of `target` (which is 'a' at index 0 and 'b' at index 1).

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to the character at index `j` of `target` (which is 'a' at index 0 and 'b' at index 1)**
