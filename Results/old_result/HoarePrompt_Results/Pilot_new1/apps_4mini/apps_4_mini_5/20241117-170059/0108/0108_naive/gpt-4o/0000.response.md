Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to determine if the string `s` can be transformed to include the entire English alphabet as a subsequence. However, it fails to account for the necessary character replacements to reach the target characters. For instance, if the input string is "aaa", the program will output `-1`, but it is possible to transform "aaa" to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" by replacing each 'a' with the subsequent letters in the alphabet. The logic of the program only checks for direct matches without considering the ability to replace characters to achieve the target subsequence. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem requirements correctly.
