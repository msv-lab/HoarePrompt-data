According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the alphabet found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been modified to 'c', and `char` is 'y'. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain the next character in the alphabet after 'y', which is 'z'. Therefore, `s` must be adjusted to include 'z', and `char` should be adjusted to 'z'.

State: **`res` is 'ax', `s` is 'z', `char` is 'z'**
