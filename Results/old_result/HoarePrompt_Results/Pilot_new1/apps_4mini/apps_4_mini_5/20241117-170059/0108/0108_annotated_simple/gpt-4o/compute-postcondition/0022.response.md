Postcondition: ***If `j` is equal to `target_len`, the function prints `target`, indicating that `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. If `j` is less than 26, it means `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, and the function prints -1. In the case where `s` is empty, both `j` and `i` are 0, and the function also prints -1. Thus, the function prints `target` if `j` equals `target_len`, otherwise it prints -1 if `j` is less than 26.***
