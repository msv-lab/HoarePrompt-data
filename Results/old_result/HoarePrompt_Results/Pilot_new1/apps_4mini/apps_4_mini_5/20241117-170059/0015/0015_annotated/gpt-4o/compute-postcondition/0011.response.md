Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, with `b` not equal to `a` and `c` not equal to 0. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if either `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0, the program prints 'NO'.***
