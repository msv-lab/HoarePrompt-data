The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of the variables. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but since `b` is equal to `a`, we can note that relationship. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables remain integers, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is equal to `a`; 'YES' is printed**
