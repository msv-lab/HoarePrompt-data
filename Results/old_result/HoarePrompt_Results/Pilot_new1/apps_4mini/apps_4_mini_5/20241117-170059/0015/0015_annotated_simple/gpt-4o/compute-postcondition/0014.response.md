The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified range, but without further details on the output, the exact functionality cannot be fully described. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on three integers a, b, and c within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The specific output is not provided.**
