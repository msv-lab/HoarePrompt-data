To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program needs to determine if a number `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence that starts with `a` and has a common difference `c`. The sequence can be expressed as:
- \( s_1 = a \)
- \( s_i = a + (i-1) \cdot c \)

We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \). 

### Code Analysis:
1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The sequence is constant, and all elements are equal to `a`.
   - If `a == b`, print "YES".
   - If `a != b`, print "NO".
   - This correctly handles the case where the sequence does not change.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if \( (b - a) \) is divisible by \( c \) (i.e., \( (b - a) \% c == 0 \)) and if the resulting index \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative.
   - This means that if \( b \) can be reached from \( a \) by adding \( c \) repeatedly, it will print "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This part seems correct as it ensures that the sequence can reach `b` from `a` given the step size `c`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case with positive `c`:** If \( b < a \), the program will correctly output "NO" because the sequence only increases.
- **Case with negative `c`:** If \( b > a \), the program will correctly output "NO" because the sequence only decreases.
- **Case with zero difference:** Handled correctly as described.

### Examples from the Problem Description:
- **Example 1:** `1 7 3` should output "YES" (correct).
- **Example 2:** `10 10 0` should output "YES" (correct).
- **Example 3:** `1 -4 5` should output "NO" (correct).
- **Example 4:** `0 60 50` should output "NO" (correct).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of both the code and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles all specified edge cases and produces the expected output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True** 

The program accurately checks whether `b` exists in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`, adhering to all conditions outlined in the problem description.
