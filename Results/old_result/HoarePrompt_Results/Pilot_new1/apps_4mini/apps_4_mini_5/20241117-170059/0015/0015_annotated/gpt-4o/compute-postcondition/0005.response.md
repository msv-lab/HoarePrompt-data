The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with values from input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; the value of `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0; and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with values from input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; the value of `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0; and the output is 'NO'**
