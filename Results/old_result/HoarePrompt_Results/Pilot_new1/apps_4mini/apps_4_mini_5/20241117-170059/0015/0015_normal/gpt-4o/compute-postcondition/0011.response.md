Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is negative but not divisible by `c`, as well as cases where `(b - a)` is positive but not divisible by `c`.***
