The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement was executed successfully without altering the existing variable values.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0. The difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer; the function prints 'YES'.**
