The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers; `c` is equal to 0; `b` is not equal to `a`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers; `c` is equal to 0; `b` is not equal to `a`, and the function prints 'NO'**
