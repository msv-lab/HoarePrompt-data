To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

The code snippet `print(total_fruits)` will output the value of `total_fruits`.

Since `total_fruits` is derived from `max_lemons`, we must first evaluate `max_lemons` based on the input integers. After calculating `max_lemons`, we can then find `total_fruits` by multiplying `max_lemons` by 7.

The output will include the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits`. However, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we will refer to them as such in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4; total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**
