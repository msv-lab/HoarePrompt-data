The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `c` is a positive integer, but the new value of `c` will depend on the input provided. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, and `c` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, and `c` is an input integer**
