Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for three integer inputs. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients needed to make a certain dish, where the first input represents the number of lemons, the second input represents the number of items that require half a lemon each, and the third input represents the number of items that require a quarter lemon each. The function then outputs the total quantity of ingredients used, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, where `min_lemon` is the minimum of the three calculated values. There are no return values, and the function solely prints the result. **
