The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, or `max_lemons * 7`. Therefore, the output state remains affected by the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` through `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits` is now defined.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**
