To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). He wants to create a compote in the ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). The task is to calculate the maximum total number of fruits he can use based on the available quantities.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func()` reads three integers (a, b, c) and calculates:
1. The maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is constrained by the available fruits:
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
   - This means:
     - You can use at most `a` lemons.
     - You can use at most `b // 2` apples (since each lemon requires 2 apples).
     - You can use at most `c // 4` pears (since each lemon requires 4 pears).

2. It then computes the total number of fruits used:
   - `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)`
   - This simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `a`, `b`, or `c` are not sufficient to create even a single set of the fruit ratio (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears), the program should return 0. For instance:
   - If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`, the minimum number of lemons that can be used is 0 since there are not enough pears. The output should be 0, which the code handles correctly.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations describe what the function does and give examples:
- The first example (2, 5, 7) shows that 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears can be used, resulting in a total of 7 fruits, which is correct.
- The second example (4, 7, 13) demonstrates that 3 lemons can be used, leading to a total of 21 fruits, which is also correct.
- The third example (2, 3, 2) confirms that not enough pears are available, resulting in an output of 0, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use based on the given ratios and constraints. It handles edge cases appropriately, ensuring that if any fruit type is insufficient to meet the ratio requirements, the output is 0.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the logic for all potential cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately determines the maximum total number of fruits that can be used based on the provided ratios and constraints, as verified by the examples and the annotations.
