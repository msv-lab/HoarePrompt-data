The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, where `b` is a positive integer. Therefore, `b // 2` is half of `b`, and `c // 4` is one-fourth of `c`. The output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as input integers, along with the calculated value of `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
