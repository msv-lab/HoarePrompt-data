The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. The code converts `num` to a string, then creates a list of its digits. Since `num` is not specified, we cannot determine the resulting list of digits. Therefore, the output state reflects the uncertainty regarding `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 9, and `num` is undefined**.
