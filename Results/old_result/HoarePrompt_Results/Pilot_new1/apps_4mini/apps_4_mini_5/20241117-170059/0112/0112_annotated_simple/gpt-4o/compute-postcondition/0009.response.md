Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values where `used_cubes[0]` is set to True if `digit` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is set to True, and `i` is 0. If `digit` is not in `cube_faces[0]` or if `used_cubes[0]` was already True, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` remains False. The condition ensures that at least one character exists in `digits` and `n` is greater than 0.***
