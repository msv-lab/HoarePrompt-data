The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has now been marked as used. Since `i` is currently 0 (as stated in the initial conditions), the first element of the `used_cubes` list is updated from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is updated to [True, False, ..., False] (with n total elements), `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is updated to [True, False, ..., False], `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`**
