According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` has at least 2 lists, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 list, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`. To execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 2 lists, and `cube` should be updated to refer to the second list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`**
