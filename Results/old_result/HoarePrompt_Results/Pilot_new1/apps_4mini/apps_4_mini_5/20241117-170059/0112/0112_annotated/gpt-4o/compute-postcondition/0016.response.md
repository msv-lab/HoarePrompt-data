The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`. The variable `i` is 2, so `used_cubes[2]` is now `True`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `cube_faces`, and `digits`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `used_cubes[2]` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `used_cubes[2]` is now `True**
