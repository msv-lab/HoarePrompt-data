According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least one character. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values set to `False`, these states do not directly affect the execution of the loop. However, we need to ensure that `digit` can take on a value from the `digits` list.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `digits` is not empty. Therefore, we can state that `digits` must contain at least one character, and we can initialize `digit` to the first character in `digits`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`**
