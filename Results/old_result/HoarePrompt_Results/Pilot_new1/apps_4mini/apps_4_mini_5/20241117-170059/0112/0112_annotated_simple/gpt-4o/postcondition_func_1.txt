The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched with available cube faces, represented as lists of integers in `cube_faces`. It returns True if all digits can be matched with distinct cube faces; otherwise, it returns False. If there are no digits in `num`, the function will directly return True since there are no digits to match. However, the function does not handle the case where the number of available cube faces (`n`) is not defined or is zero, which could lead to an error in execution.
