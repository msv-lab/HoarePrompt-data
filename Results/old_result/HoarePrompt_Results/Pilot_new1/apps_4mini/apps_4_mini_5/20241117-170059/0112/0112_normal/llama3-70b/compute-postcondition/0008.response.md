The `update` method is called on the `digits` set, which adds elements to it. The elements being added are string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. The previous values of `digits` are not specified, but it will now include the string representations of the integers present in `cube`. The `cubes` variable is not directly affected, and since `n` is within the range of 1 to 3, it does not influence the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third cube in `cubes`; `digits` now contains string representations of the integers in `cube`, plus new string representations from `cube`.**
