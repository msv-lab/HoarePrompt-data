The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\), the output state reflects that `n` is now the input integer within that range. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
