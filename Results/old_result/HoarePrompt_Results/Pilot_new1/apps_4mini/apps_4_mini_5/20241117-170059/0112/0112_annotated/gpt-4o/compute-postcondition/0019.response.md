Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, and `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character. If `used_cubes[2]` was previously `False` and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[2]` was already `True` or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[2]`, then there is no change to `used_cubes[2]` or `found`.***
