The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input integer within the range of 1 to 3. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
