The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `used_cubes` has its second element set to True, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
