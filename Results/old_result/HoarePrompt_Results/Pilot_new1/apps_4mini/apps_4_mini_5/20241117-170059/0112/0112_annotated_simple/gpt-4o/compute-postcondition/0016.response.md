The code assigns the value `True` to `used_cubes[i]`, indicating that the `i`-th cube has been used. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `i` is 1. The state of `digits`, `digit`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is set to `True`**
