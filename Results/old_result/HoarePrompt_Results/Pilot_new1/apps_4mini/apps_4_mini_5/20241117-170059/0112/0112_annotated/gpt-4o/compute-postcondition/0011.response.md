The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`. The variable `i` is currently 1, which means the second element of the `used_cubes` list (considering 0-based indexing) will be updated to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `used_cubes` has the second element set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` has the second element set to `True`**
