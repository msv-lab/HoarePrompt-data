The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is an integer in the range of 1 to 3, and it processes a cube represented as a list of 6 integers, where each integer is in the range of 0 to 9. The output of the function is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to handle cubes defined by the constraints mentioned, but the specific return value or behavior is not detailed.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a cube represented as a list of 6 integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9, and n is an integer between 1 and 3. The specific return value is not provided.**
