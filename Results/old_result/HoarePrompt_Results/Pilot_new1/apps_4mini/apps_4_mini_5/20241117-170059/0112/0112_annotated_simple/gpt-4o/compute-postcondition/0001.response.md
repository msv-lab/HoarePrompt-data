The variable `used_cubes` is assigned a list of boolean values, all initialized to `False`, with a length of `n`. The value of `n` is not defined in the initial state, but it represents the number of cubes. The initial state of `digits` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged `digits` and the new `used_cubes` list.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, where `num` is an integer from `cube_faces`; `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [False] * n**
