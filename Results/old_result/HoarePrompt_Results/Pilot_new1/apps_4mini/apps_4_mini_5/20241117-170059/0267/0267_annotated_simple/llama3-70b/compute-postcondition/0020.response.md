Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n`. If `k` is 1, then `dp[n, k]` is 9. If `k` is at least 2, `dp[n, k]` is calculated based on a formula involving powers of 10 and is then taken modulo `MOD`. Additionally, if `dp[n, k]` is -720, it is updated according to `MOD`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged throughout the process.***
