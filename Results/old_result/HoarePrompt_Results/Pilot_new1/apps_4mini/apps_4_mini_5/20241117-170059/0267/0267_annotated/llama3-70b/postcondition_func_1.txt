The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0. If the tuple `(n, k)` exists in `dp`, it returns the corresponding value from `dp`. If `n` is less than \(10^k\), it assigns `n` to `dp[n, k]`. If `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\), it calculates a value based on the number of digits and updates `dp[n, k]` accordingly, then returns this value. The function also ensures that the final result is taken modulo `MOD`.
