The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0, and there are no changes to the other variables `l`, `r`, and `k`. The state of the variables remains unchanged, as the code only assigns a value to `total_sum`. Therefore, the output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0**
