Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `k` is equal to 1, then `dp[n, k]` is set to 9. If `k` is at least 2, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the provided formula, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `k` is less than 1 or greater than 10, no changes are made to the values in `dp`.***
