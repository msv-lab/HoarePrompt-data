According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute for `num` starting from `l` and going up to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l < r\), which means that `num` is currently equal to `r`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented, which means `r` needs to be increased. Since `r` is currently equal to `l + 1` or greater, we need to ensure that `r` is at least `l + 2`. Thus, `r` must be adjusted to be greater than `l + 1`.

The state of `total_sum` does not need to be adjusted, as it will remain 0 if `func_1(num, k)` returns false, and it will be updated if it returns true during the next iteration.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to `l + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0**
