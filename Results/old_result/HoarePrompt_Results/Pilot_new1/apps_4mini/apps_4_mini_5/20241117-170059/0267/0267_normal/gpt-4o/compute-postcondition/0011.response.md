According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is at least `r + 1`, which means it has been incremented to allow for one more iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, `num` must take on a value that is equal to `r + 1`. Since `num` starts at `l` and increments until it reaches `r + 1`, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `r` is adjusted to reflect that `num` has reached `r + 1`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `r` must be adjusted to be equal to `r + 1` since it has been incremented.
- `num` should be adjusted to be `r + 1` because that is the next value in the range.

No other states need to be adjusted since `l` and `k` remain unchanged.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is equal to `r + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `num` is `r + 1`**
