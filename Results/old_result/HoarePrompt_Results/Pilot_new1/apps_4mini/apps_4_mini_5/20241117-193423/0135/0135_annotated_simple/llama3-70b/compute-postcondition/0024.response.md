The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18} \). The output behavior of the function has not been specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value or functionality based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined without further details on its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
