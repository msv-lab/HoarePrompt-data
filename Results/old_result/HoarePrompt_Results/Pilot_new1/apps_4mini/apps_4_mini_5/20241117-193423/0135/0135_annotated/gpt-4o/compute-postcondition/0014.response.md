Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No' and the loop does not execute. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop executes up to `k` times. After the loop, `seen_remainders` contains the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If a remainder is repeated during the loop, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder, there is no return value, and `seen_remainders` contains unique remainders from the divisions.**
