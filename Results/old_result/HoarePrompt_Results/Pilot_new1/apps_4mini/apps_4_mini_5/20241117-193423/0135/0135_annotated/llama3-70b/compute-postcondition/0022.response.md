Output State: **`seen` contains the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, `i` will be equal to `k` after the loop execution if `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `seen` remains an empty set. If any remainder is repeated during the loop execution, the output is 'No' and the program exits.**
