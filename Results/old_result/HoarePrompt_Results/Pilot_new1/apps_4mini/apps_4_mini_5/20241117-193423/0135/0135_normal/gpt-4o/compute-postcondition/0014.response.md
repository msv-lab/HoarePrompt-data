Output State: **`seen_remainders` contains the unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If a remainder is found in `seen_remainders` during any iteration, the function returns 'No' immediately. If all iterations complete without duplicates, `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders for the range.**
