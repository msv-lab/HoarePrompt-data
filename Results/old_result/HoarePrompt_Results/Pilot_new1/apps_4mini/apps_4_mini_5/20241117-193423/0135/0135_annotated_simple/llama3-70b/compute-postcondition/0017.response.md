The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, and `remainder` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now contains both its previous values and the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, and the output is 'No'**
