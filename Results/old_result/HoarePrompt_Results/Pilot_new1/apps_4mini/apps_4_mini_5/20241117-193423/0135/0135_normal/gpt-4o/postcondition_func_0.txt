The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where both must be greater than or equal to 1. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for duplicate remainders when dividing `n` by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any duplicate remainder is found during these divisions, the function returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, as the loop would not execute in such cases, and it would implicitly return None.
