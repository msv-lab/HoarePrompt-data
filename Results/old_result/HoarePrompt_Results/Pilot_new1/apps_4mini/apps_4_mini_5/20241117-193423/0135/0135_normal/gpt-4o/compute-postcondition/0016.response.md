The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, there is no return value from the function.
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If a remainder is found in `seen_remainders` during any iteration, the function returns 'No' immediately. If all iterations complete without duplicates, `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders for the range.
- In Case 3, if no duplicates are found, the program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n` and no duplicate remainders are found when dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k`, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for duplicate remainders when dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k` and returns 'No' if duplicates are found; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.**
