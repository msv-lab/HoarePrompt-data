The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables before the exit.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now contains both its previous values and the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, and the output is 'No'**
