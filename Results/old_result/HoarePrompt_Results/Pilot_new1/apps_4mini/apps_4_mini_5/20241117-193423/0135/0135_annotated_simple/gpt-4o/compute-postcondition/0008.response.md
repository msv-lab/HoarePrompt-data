Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, the function continues execution without returning 'No'.***
