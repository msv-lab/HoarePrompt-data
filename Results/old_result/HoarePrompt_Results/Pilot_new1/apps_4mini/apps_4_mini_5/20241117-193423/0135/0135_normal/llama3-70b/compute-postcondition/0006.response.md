The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. As a result, the values of the variables do not change, but the program will stop executing further. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables before the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function prints 'No' and the program exits.**
