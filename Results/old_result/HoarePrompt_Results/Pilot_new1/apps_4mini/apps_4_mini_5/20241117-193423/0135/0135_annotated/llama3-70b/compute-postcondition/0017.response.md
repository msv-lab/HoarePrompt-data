The code executes the `print('No')` statement, which outputs the string 'No'. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'**
