The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any of these remainders are repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and 'Yes' is printed immediately.
