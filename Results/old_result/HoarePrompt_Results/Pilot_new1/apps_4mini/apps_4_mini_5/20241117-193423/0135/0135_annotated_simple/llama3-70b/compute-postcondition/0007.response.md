Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set or a set that does not contain `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and terminates. Otherwise, the program continues execution without printing anything.***
