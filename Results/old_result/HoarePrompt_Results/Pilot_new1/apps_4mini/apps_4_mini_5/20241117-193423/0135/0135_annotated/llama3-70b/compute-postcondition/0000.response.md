The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input provided, which will be two integers separated by a space. The initial state specifies that both `n` and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). The values of `n` and `k` will change based on the input received. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
