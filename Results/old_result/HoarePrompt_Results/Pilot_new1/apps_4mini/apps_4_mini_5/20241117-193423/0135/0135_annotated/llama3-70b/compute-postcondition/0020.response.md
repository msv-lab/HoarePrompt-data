The code adds `remainder` to the set `seen`. Since `seen` already contains `remainder` (which is either 0 or 1), if `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program would output 'No' and exit. However, since the code provided only executes the addition and does not include any checks or exits, the state of `seen` will change by adding `remainder`. 

If `remainder` is 0, `seen` will still contain 0, and if `remainder` is 1, `seen` will now contain both 0 and 1. 

The output state will reflect the updated contents of `seen` based on the value of `remainder`, but no return or exit occurs. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1; `seen` now contains `remainder`.**
