Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a`, `b` are positive integers; `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated floor values. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In both cases, `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated, and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.***
