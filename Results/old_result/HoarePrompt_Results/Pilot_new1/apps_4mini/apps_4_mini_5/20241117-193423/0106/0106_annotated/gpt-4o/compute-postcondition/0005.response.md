Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment` representing an apartment number and calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` within a multi-block structure where each block contains `m` floors, and each floor contains `k` apartments. It returns a tuple containing the `block` number and the `floor` number derived from these calculations. The function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are not defined or are zero, which could lead to a division by zero error in the calculations. **
