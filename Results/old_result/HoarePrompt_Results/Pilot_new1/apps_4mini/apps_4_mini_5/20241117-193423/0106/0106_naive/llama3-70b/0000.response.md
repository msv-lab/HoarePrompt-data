To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**: 
   - `n`: number of blocks (entrances)
   - `m`: number of floors in each block
   - `k`: number of apartments on each floor
   - `a`: apartment number of Edward
   - `b`: apartment number of Natasha

2. **Apartment Numbering**:
   - Apartments are numbered from 1 to `n * m * k`.
   - The first apartment on the first floor of the first block is 1, the first apartment on the second floor of the first block is `k + 1`, etc.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - Moving up or down one floor takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving from one block to an adjacent block takes 15 seconds.
   - The elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor to move.

### Code Analysis
```python
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
if a_floor > b_floor:
    min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
else:
    min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

### Potential Issues
1. **Block Calculation**: 
   - The calculation for `a_block` and `b_block` seems incorrect. The formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is intended to find the block number, but it should use `k` instead of `m * k`. It should be `(a - 1) // k + 1` because each block has `k` apartments per floor, and there are `m` floors in total.
   
2. **Floor Calculation**:
   - The calculation for floors using `(a - 1) % m + 1` is correct, as it captures the correct floor number.
   
3. **Minimum Block Time Calculation**:
   - The calculation for `min_block_time` does not account for the fact that if Edward is in block `n` and Natasha is in block `1`, he should be able to go around the building in either direction. The current calculation does handle this by taking the minimum of the two distances, which is correct.

4. **Floor Transition Time**:
   - The elevator time calculation is not considered in the final output. The current code adds an elevator wait time of 10 seconds when moving to a higher floor, but it does not differentiate the time taken if Edward needs to go down or up using the stairs or the elevator.

### Example Test Cases
1. **Case where Edward and Natasha are on the same floor but different blocks**:
   ```
   Input:
   3 2 2
   3 4
   ```
   Expected Output: 15 seconds (moving between blocks)
   The program calculates the correct time.

2. **Case where Edward needs to use the elevator**:
   ```
   Input:
   2 2 2
   1 4
   ```
   Expected Output: 10 seconds (elevator wait) + 1 second (1 floor) + 15 seconds (to next block) = 26 seconds
   The program does not consider the elevator correctly.

### Conclusion
The program has a major flaw in how it calculates the block numbers and does not properly account for the elevator's time when moving between floors. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
