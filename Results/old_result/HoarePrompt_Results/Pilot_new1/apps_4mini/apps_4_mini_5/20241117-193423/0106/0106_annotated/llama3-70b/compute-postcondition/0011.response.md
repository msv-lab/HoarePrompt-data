Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. `a` is an integer, `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1, and `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. If `b_floor` is undefined, `min_floor_time` cannot be computed.***
