The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with values between 1 and 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range of 1 to \( n \cdot m \cdot k \). The function's output is determined by these parameters. 

The functionality of the function `func` is not explicitly stated in the provided output section, so we cannot define specific return values or behaviors without additional context. However, based on the constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely performs some operations involving these parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000), and a and b are distinct integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k), but does not accept parameters directly. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
