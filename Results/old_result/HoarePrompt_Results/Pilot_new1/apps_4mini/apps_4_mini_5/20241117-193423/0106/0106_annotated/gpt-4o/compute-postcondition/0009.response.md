To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The code calculates `min_walk_time` as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
2. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are already defined based on the initial state.
3. The calculation itself does not change the values of `direct_walk_time` or `reverse_walk_time`, but it assigns the minimum of the two to `min_walk_time`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and will include the new variable `min_walk_time`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**
