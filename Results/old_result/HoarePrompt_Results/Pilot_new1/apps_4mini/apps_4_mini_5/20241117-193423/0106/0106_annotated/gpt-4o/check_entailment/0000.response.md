To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the provided code, including the annotations.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. **Building Structure**: The building has `n` entrances, each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
2. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered sequentially from 1 to `n * m * k`.
3. **Movement Time**:
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving between entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - Using the elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor.
4. **Starting Point**: Edward can only exit from the first floor of his entrance.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - It calculates the block (entrance) and floor based on the apartment number.
   - There is a potential issue if `m` or `k` is 0, but according to the constraints, they are always â‰¥ 1. Thus, this function is valid within the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - It retrieves Edward's and Natasha's locations using `get_location`.
   - It calculates `time_to_exit` based on whether Edward is on the first floor or not.
   - It computes the direct and reverse walking times between blocks.
   - It then calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor and sums all components to return the total time.

### Key Points in Code Logic:
- The calculation for `time_to_exit` correctly accounts for the time taken to use the elevator if Edward is not on the first floor.
- The walking time is computed considering both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, which is appropriate given the circular arrangement of entrances.
- The final time calculation includes all necessary components.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the scenario where `a` or `b` is outside the valid range of apartments, but the problem guarantees that they are within bounds.
- The annotations suggest that `time_to_exit` is at least 11 seconds if `floor_a` is greater than 1, which aligns with the problem description.
- The program does not check for invalid results from `get_location`, but since the input constraints are guaranteed, this is not an issue.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment under all specified conditions. No edge cases or discrepancies were found that would invalidate the logic.

Therefore, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True**
