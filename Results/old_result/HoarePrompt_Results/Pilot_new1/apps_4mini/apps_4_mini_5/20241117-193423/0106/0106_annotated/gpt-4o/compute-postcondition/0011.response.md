To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `total_time` is calculated by summing three components: `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.
2. The initial values of `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are already calculated based on the previous state.
3. The calculation for `total_time` does not alter the values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, or `time_to_target_floor`, but it combines them into a new variable, `total_time`.

Since we do not have the specific values for `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, we cannot provide a numerical output for `total_time`. However, we can summarize the relationships.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is (floor_b - 1) * 5; `total_time` is calculated as time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor.**
