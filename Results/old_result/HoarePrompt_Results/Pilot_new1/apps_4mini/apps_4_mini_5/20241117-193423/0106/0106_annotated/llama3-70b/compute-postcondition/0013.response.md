The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates on the following constraints: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on the return value based on the operations performed within the function, we cannot define the exact functionality. 

Functionality: **The function operates on positive integers n, m, k, and distinct integers a, b representing apartment numbers, but the specific return value is not provided.**
