To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code in conjunction with the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The first line reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor, respectively.
   - The second line reads two integers `a` and `b`, which are the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks**:
   - The code calculates which floor (`a_floor`, `b_floor`) and which block (`a_block`, `b_block`) Edward and Natasha are in based on their apartment numbers:
     - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1`: This correctly computes the floor number.
     - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`: This correctly computes the block number.
   - The same calculations are performed for Natasha's apartment number.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimal time to move between blocks:
     - `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`: This accounts for the circular nature of the building when moving between blocks.
   - The program then calculates the time to move between floors:
     - The time taken to go from Edward's floor to Natasha's floor is calculated based on whether Edward's floor is above or below Natasha's floor, adding 10 seconds for the elevator wait time.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the total time calculated from the block and floor movements.

### Testing Edge Cases

To determine if the program is correct, we must consider edge cases:
- **Minimum Values**: For `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 2` (not possible since a and b must be different). 
- **Same Floor, Different Blocks**: If Edward and Natasha are on the same floor but in different blocks, the program should correctly calculate the time to walk between blocks.
- **Different Floors, Same Block**: If they are in the same block but on different floors, the program should correctly calculate the time to move between floors.
- **Maximum Values**: Test with maximum values for `n`, `m`, and `k` (1000 each) to ensure no overflow or performance issues.

### Potential Issue Found

Upon reviewing the code, there's a logical flaw in the way the program calculates the time when both Edward and Natasha are in the same block but on different floors. The elevator wait time of 10 seconds is incorrectly added regardless of whether Edward is already on the first floor or not. 

For example:
- If Edward is on the first floor of block 1 (let's say `a = 1`), and Natasha is on the second floor of block 1 (`b = 6`), the program will incorrectly add the elevator wait time of 10 seconds when it should not because Edward can simply walk up to Natasha's floor without needing the elevator.

### Conclusion

Given the logical flaw identified in the elevator time calculation, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
