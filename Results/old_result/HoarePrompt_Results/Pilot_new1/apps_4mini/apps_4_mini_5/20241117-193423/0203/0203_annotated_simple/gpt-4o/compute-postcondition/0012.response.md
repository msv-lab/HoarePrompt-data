The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer in the range 1 to 200,000. The state of `r_queue` will change to include the value of `i`, but the values of `n`, `votes`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value added to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to `n`; `v` is a character that indicates there are no more characters left to process; `r_queue` now includes `i`.**
