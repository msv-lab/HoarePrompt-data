The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 2, and since `d_queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it exists. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer within 3 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length at least 3; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character in the string `votes`, and `d_queue` now includes the value 2.
