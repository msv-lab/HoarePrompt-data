Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, if the first character of `fractions` (denoted as `fraction`) is equal to 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not equal to 'D', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0.***
