The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \). The parameter `votes` is a string consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters with a length of `n`, where 'D' represents an employee from the depublicans fraction and 'R' represents an employee from the remocrats. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string. The exact output details are not provided, but it can be inferred that the function will likely return a value indicative of the voting results based on the counts of these characters.
