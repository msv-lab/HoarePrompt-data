The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and the input string `votes` is also unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new initialization of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string after stripping whitespace; `d_queue` is an empty list**
