The code appends the value `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous value of `d_index` is known, and `n` is an additional value that is being added. Since `d_index` is less than `r_index`, it indicates that `d_index + n` will be a new value that is appended to the end of the `d_queue`. The state of `r_index` and the previous elements in `d_queue` will not change.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (d_index + n), `d_index` is the value that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.**
