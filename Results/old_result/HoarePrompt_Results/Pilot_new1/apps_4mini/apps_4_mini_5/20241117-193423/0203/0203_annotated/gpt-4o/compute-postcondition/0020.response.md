The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. If `votes` is non-empty, `d_queue` must contain indices of 'D' characters. The state of `d_queue` changes as its first element is removed, while `r_queue` remains unaffected. If `d_queue` is empty, trying to pop an element would raise an error, but the prompt specifies that the loop executes only if `votes` is non-empty, implying that `d_queue` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `d_queue` and the new value of `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is updated (first element removed), `d_index` is the popped index from `d_queue`**
