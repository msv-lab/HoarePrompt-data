The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged before this operation. After executing the code, the first element of `r_queue` will be removed, and `r_index` will hold that value. The states of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_queue` will change accordingly. 

Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` is now one element shorter, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` is now one element shorter, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.**
