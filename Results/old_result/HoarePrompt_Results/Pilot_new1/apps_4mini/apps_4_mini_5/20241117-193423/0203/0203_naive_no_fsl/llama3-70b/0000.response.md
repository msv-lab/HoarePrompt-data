Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the voting procedure as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of employees from each fraction and determines the winner based on which count is greater. However, the voting process is more complex and involves employees denying each other the right to vote in a sequential manner, which can significantly affect the outcome.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
DRDRD
```

In this case, the voting could proceed as follows:

1. Employee 1 (D) denies Employee 2 (R) from voting.
2. Employee 3 (R) denies Employee 4 (D) from voting.
3. Employee 5 (D) denies Employee 3 (R) from voting.

After these actions, Employee 1 and Employee 5 are left to vote, and since both are from the depublicans fraction, the outcome would favor depublicans ('D'). 

However, the program would incorrectly output 'R' since it counts 3 'D's and 2 'R's, and assumes that the greater count directly translates to a win without considering the actual voting dynamics and the denial process.

Thus, the program fails to account for the necessary logic of the voting procedure, leading to incorrect predictions in certain scenarios.
