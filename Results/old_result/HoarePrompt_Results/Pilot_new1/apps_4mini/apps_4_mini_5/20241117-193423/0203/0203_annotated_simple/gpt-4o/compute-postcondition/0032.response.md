Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element which is `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, otherwise `d_queue` has one less index after popping the first element. In both cases, `r_queue` has one less element and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped. Additionally, if `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, `r_queue` now contains an additional element which is `r_index + n`.***
