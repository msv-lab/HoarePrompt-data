The value of `r_index` is assigned the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation. The operation removes the first element from `r_queue`, but since `r_queue` remains unchanged in terms of its state before the pop operation, we only focus on `r_index`. The previous state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation.**
