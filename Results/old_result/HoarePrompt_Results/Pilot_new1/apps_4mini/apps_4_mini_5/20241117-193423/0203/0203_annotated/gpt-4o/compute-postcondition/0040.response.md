Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will continue executing until at least one of the queues becomes empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will contain elements that have been incremented by `n`, and if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will contain elements that have been incremented by `n`. If `votes` is empty, the loop doesn't execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If either queue is initially empty, the loop doesn't execute, and the values of both queues remain unchanged.**
