The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is not specified in the initial state. Since `r_queue` is now one element shorter, appending a new element will increase its length by one. The previous values of the affected variables are checked, but since `n` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended. Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes made without specifying the exact value.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` is now one element shorter, and `r_queue` has a new element appended which is `r_index + n`.**
