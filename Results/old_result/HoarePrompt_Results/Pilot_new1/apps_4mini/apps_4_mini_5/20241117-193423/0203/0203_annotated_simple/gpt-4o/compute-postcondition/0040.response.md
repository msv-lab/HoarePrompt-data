Output State: **If `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty and the loop does not execute. If `votes` contains only 'D' characters, `r_queue` is empty, and `d_queue` contains all indices from 0 to n-1. If `votes` contains no 'D' characters, `d_queue` is empty, and `r_queue` contains all indices from 0 to n-1. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will execute until one of the queues is empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is non-empty, it will contain indices of 'D' characters shifted by multiples of `n`, while `r_queue` will contain indices of non-'D' characters similarly shifted. If `d_queue` is empty, then `r_queue` will contain shifted indices of non-'D' characters, and if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will contain shifted indices of 'D' characters. The loop will not execute if either queue is initially empty.**
