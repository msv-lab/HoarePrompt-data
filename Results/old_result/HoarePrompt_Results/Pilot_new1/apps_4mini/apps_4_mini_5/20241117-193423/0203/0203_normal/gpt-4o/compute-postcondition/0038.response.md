Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, with the new element being `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `d_queue` remains one element shorter, while `r_queue` has one less element and a new element `r_index + n` appended. In all cases, `d_index` remains the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.***
