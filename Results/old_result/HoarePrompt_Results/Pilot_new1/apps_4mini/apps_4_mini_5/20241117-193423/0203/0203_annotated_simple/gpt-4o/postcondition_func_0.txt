The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `votes` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It processes the votes by maintaining two queues for indices of 'D' and 'R' characters. The function continues to shift indices in the queues based on their relative positions until one of the queues is empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if there are any remaining 'D' characters in the queue, or 'R' if there are none, indicating the outcome of the voting process. The function does not handle invalid input cases, such as non-integer values for `n` or invalid characters in `votes`.
