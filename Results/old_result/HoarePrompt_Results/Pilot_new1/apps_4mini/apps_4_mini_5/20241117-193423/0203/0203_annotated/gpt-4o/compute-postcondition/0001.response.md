The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, where `input()` takes input from the user and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed**
