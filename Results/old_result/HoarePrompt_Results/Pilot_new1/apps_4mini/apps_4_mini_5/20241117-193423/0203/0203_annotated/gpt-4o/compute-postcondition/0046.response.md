The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which represent the two fractions of employees. After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs to determine the outcome based on the distribution of votes. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n`, where `votes` consists of characters 'D' and 'R', and return the result based on the voting outcome. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns the result based on the voting outcome.**
