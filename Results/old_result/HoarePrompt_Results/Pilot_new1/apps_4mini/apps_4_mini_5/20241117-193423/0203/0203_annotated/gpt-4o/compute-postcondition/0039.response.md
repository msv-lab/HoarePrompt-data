According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the non-emptiness of the queues `d_queue` and `r_queue`. For the loop to execute again, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must contain at least one element each. 

At the end of the last iteration, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue` and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one more element appended to it, which means it still has elements. However, if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has one more element appended, and `d_queue` has one element less. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` still have at least one element. This means that if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `d_queue` must have started with at least 2 elements in order to still have elements left after the iteration.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `d_queue` must have at least 1 element remaining, and `r_queue` must also have at least 1 element remaining.

State: **`d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue` and `d_queue` has at least 1 element, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue` and `r_queue` has at least 1 element**
