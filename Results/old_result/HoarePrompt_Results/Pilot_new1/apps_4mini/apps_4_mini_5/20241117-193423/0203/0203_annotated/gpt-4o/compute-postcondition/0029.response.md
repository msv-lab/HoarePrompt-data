The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from `r_queue` using `pop(0)`. The original state indicates that `r_queue` has at least one element remaining, so after this operation, `r_queue` will have one less element. The values of `d_queue` and `d_index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_queue` has at least one element remaining, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_queue` has one less element; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
