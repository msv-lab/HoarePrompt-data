According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the string `fractions`. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more character remaining in the string after `fraction`. Since `fraction` is the next character, it indicates that there are still characters left in `fractions`. Therefore, we need to specify that `fractions` has at least two characters remaining.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, and `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one.**
