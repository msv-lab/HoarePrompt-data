According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `votes` string. For the loop to execute, the `votes` string must contain at least one character. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it indicates the length of `votes`. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `votes` has a length greater than 0. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0, and `v` will be the first character of the `votes` string during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`**
