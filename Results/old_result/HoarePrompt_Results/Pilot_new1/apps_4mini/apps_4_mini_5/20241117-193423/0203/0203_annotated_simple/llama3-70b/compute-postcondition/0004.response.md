According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. If `n` is greater than 0, then `fractions` must have at least one character for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `fraction` will be the first character in the `fractions` string. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and `fraction` should be the first character in the `fractions` string.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`**
