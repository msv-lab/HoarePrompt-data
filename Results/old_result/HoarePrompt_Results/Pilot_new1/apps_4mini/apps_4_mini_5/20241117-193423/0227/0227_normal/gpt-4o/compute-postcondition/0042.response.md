Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by the number of iterations, `assigned` contains elements that are checked against, `i` is incremented for each iteration starting from 2, and `n` is greater than 2. If `assigned` is empty, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.***
