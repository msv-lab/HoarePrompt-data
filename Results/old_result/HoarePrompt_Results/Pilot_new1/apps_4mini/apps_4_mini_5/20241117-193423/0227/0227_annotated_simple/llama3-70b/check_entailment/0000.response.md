To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the minimum number of variables \( m \) such that we can perform a sequence of operations on them based on the distinct positive integers provided. The first integer in the sequence is assigned directly to one variable, and each subsequent integer must be the sum of the values in two variables. If it's impossible to perform the operations with any number of variables, we should return -1.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2:
            m += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is equal to the count of distinct integers in `a` that are not double the previous integer in the list. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `m` remains 1. If `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute `n-1` times, and `m` will be incremented based on the conditions specified in the loop.
    print(m if m <= 23 else -1)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) distinct integers.
2. **Sorting**: The integers are sorted in ascending order.
3. **Variable Count Initialization**: The variable \( m \) is initialized to 1, assuming at least one variable is needed.
4. **Loop Through Sorted List**: The loop iterates through the sorted list starting from the second element:
   - If the current element is not double the previous element, it increments \( m \).
5. **Output**: The program prints \( m \) if it's less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.

### Issues and Edge Cases:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Variables**: The logic of counting variables based solely on whether the current number is double the previous one is flawed. This does not account for situations where the sequence cannot be produced by the available sums. For example:
   - If the input is `3 6 5`, after sorting we have `3, 5, 6`. The logic would incorrectly suggest \( m = 3 \) because none of these numbers are double the previous number. However, it is impossible to create the number 5 using any combination of sums from the previous numbers.
   
2. **Return -1 for Impossible Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where it is impossible to achieve the required sums. The condition to return -1 is only based on the value of \( m \) exceeding 23, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of variables \( m \) or to identify impossible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The expected output is `-1`, but the program will output `3`, indicating it does not handle this case correctly.
