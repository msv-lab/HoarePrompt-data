The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, if `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the count of values for which no previously assigned value can form the difference with the current `a[i]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the count of specific values based on the conditions described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers `a`, returning 1 if `n` is 1, or the count of values for which no previous assigned value can form the difference with the current `a[i]` otherwise.**
