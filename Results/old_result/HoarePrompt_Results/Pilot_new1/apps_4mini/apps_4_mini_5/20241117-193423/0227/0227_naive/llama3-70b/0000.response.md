Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to determine the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform a sequence of operations based on the input list of distinct integers. However, it fails to account for several scenarios, particularly when the required sums cannot be formed with the available variables.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 3 4 7
```
In this case, the necessary operations cannot be performed using just one variable, as:
- `b_1 := 1`
- The next required operation would need to create the value `3`, which cannot be obtained from just `1`.
- The next required operation would need to create the value `4`, which also cannot be obtained from `1` or `3`.

The program only checks if each subsequent number in the sorted list is double the previous number to increment `m`. This logic does not correctly ensure that all required sums can be generated, leading to incorrect results in cases like the one provided.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
