The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, so after execution, `can_form` is now `True`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, and `m`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is now `True`, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, `n` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged**
