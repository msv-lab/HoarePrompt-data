Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It counts the number of distinct integers in the list that are not double the previous integer in the sorted list. If the count exceeds 23, the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 since there is only one integer. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, which is an edge case not covered in the code. **
