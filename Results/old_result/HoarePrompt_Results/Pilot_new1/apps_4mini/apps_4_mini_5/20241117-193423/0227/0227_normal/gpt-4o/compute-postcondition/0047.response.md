The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the states of `assigned`, `i`, and `n` remain as they were. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` has an element `a[i]` added to it, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`assigned` has an element `a[i]` added to it, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `can_form` is False**
