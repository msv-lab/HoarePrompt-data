The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
