The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state indicated that `can_form` is determined by whether the difference between `a[2]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, but since the code snippet directly assigns `True` to `can_form`, we do not need to consider the previous conditions for this assignment. The other variables `m` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is 2, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`**
