The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, which is already its value according to the initial state. The states of the other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the other variables.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2**
