Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, and `m` is either 3 or 4. If `a[2]` is not equal to double the value of `a[1]`, then `m` is incremented by 1, resulting in `m` being 3 or 4. If `a[2]` is equal to double the value of `a[1]`, then `m` remains unchanged at 3.***
