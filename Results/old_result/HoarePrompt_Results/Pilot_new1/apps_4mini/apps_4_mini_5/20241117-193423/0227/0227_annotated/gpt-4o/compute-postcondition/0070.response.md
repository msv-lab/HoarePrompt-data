The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer \(a_k\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_k \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns a value of `m`, which is the count of distinct groups that cannot be formed from the differences of elements in the list `a`, based on the conditions met during the loop's execution. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of n distinct integers a, and returns the count of distinct groups that cannot be formed from the differences of the elements in a.**
