To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform a series of operations based on a sequence of distinct integers. The operations allow us to assign values to variables and derive new values based on previously assigned ones.

### Code Analysis
1. **Sorting the Input**: 
   The first line of the function sorts the input list `a`. This is a reasonable step, as it helps in determining the smallest values first, which can be crucial for forming subsequent values.

2. **Initialization**: 
   The variable `assigned` is initialized as a set with the first element of `a`, and `m` is initialized to 1 (indicating at least one variable is needed).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `a`, starting from the second element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if it can be formed by the sum of two previously assigned values (stored in the `assigned` set).
   - If no such combination exists, it increments `m`, indicating that a new variable is required.

### Potential Edge Cases
To verify the correctness, we need to consider scenarios where the program might fail:

- **Case with Non-formable Values**: 
  If we have a sequence where no two previous values can sum to the next value, the program should correctly increment `m` for each such value. However, if the program incorrectly identifies that a value can be formed when it cannot, it will return an incorrect count of `m`.

#### Example Case
Let's consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 7 8
```
- After sorting, the sequence remains `[1, 2, 3, 7, 8]`.
- The logic will check:
  - For `3`: It can be formed by `1 + 2`, so `m` remains `1`.
  - For `7`: It cannot be formed by any combination of `1, 2, 3`, so `m` increments to `2`.
  - For `8`: It cannot be formed by any combination of `1, 2, 3, 7`, so `m` increments to `3`.

The expected output for this case is `3`, which is correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables required for the operations described in the problem statement. There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
