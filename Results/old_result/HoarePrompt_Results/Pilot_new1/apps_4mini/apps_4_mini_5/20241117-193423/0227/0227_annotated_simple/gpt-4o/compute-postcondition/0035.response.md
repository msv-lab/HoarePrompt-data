Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False initially. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, `i` remains 2, `x` remains the second element in `assigned`, and both `n` and `m` remain unchanged.***
