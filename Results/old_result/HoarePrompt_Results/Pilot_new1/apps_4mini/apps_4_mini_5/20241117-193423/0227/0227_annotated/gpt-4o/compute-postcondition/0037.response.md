The value of `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, which it already holds. Therefore, there is no change to the variable's state. The states of other variables remain unaffected. The output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned` (after the current one).

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned` (after the current one)**
