Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the last element of `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains unchanged, and the loop continues.***
