Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty list, and `x` is the last element of `assigned`. If the value of `a[i] - x` is found in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, but the conditions regarding `m`, `n`, `i`, `assigned`, and `x` still hold.***
