The `sort()` method is called on the list `a`, which will rearrange the elements of `a` in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 23`. The specific values of the integers in the list are not provided, but their distinctness and positivity are guaranteed. After sorting, the order of the integers will change, but the distinctness and positivity will remain.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers.**
