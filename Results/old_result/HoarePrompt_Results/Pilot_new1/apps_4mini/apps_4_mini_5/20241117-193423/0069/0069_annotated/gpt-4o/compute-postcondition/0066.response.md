Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 1, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is initialized to 0, `b` is equal to `prefix_balances[0]`, `x` is such that the difference `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance` (i.e., `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0)`.***
