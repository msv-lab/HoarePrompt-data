Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is calculated based on the values of `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`. Edge cases include scenarios where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a potential division by zero, which is not handled in the precondition. In such cases, the behavior is undefined.***
