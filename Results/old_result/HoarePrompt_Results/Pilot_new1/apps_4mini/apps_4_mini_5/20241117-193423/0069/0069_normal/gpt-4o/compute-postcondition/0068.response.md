Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative; otherwise, `count` remains 0. The variable `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a positive integer.***
