The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, so the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new assignment of `s`. Since `s` takes its value from `data`, which is not specified, we denote it as `data[index + 2]`.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has -1 appended to it, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with zeros, and `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]**.
