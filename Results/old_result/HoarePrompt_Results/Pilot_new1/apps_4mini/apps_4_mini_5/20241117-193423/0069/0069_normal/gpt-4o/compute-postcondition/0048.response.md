The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The previous state of `prefix_balances` was a list of length 1 filled with zeros. After execution, the new length of `prefix_balances` will be `n + 1`, and it will be filled with zeros.

Therefore, the output state is: `balance` is `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has -1 appended to it, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`balance` is `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has -1 appended to it, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3**
