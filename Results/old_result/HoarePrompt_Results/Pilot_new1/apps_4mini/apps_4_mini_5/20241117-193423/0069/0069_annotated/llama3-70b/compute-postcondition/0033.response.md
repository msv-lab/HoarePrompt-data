Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Additionally, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the program will also print -1 when `x` is equal to `balance`, as this would lead to a division by zero. This accounts for the edge case where the balance is zero, ensuring that the output remains well-defined.***
