Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string from input, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by the difference `(cnt0 - cnt1)`***
