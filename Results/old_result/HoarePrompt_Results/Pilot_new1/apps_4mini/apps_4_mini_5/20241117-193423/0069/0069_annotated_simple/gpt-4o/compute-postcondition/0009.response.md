The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer from `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, and `index` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer from `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, and `index` is increased by 3**
