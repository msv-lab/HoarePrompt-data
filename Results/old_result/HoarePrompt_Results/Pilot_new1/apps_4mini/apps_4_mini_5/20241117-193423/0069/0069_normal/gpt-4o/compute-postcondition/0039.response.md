Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. If `prefix_balances` is empty, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `balance` is 0, the condition `(x - b) % balance` could cause a division by zero error, which is not handled.**
