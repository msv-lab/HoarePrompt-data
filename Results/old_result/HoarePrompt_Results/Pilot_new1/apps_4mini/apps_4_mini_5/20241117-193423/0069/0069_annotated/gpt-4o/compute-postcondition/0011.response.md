The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list containing `n + 1` zeros. The values of the other variables remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the newly created list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned the value of the first element in `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[2]`, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is assigned the value of `s.count('0') - s.count('1'), and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros**
