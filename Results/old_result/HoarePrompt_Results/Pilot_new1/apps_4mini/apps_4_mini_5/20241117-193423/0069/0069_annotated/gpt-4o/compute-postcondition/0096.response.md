The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of `results` are not specified, but the operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `-1` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1**.
