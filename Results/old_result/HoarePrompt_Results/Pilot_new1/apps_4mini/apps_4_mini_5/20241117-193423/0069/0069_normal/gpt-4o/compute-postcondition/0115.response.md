Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the cumulative balance based on the string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; if `x` is not found, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the count of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, indicating the number of valid solutions based on the balance. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0 or negative, meaning `prefix_balances` remains as [0] and `results` would be either -1 or 0 depending on the value of `x`.***
