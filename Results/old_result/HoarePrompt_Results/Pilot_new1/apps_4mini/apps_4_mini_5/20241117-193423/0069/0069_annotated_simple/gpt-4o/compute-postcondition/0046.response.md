The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is an integer, `T` is greater than the number of iterations already executed, `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2] and `index` is increased by 3.
