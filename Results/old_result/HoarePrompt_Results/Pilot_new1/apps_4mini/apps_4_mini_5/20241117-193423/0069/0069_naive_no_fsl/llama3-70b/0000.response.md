Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical flaw in its handling of the balance calculation. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the case when the balance of the string `s` is zero (i.e., `cnt0 == cnt1`). 

Consider the following test case:

```
1 0
01
```

In this case, `cnt0 = 1`, `cnt1 = 1`, and thus `balance = cnt0 - cnt1 = 0`. The program will check if `balance == x`, which is true in this case, and will return `n + 1 = 2`. However, since the infinite string `t` will also have a balance of 0 for every prefix, there are indeed an infinite number of prefixes with a balance of 0. The program fails to identify this scenario because it does not handle the case where both counts are equal, leading to an incorrect output.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
