Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative; `results` now includes `count`. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged throughout the execution.***
