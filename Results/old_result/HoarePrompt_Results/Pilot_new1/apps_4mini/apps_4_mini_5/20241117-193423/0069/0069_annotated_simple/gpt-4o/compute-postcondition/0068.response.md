Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
