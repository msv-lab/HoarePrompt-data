Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, and if the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is a non-negative integer, then `count` is increased by 1. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
