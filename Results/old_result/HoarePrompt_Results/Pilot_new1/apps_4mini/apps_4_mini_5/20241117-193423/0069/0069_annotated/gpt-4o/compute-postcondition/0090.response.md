According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined in the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and it must still be within the range of `1` to `n + 1`.

Since `i` is currently 2, it can be incremented to 3 for the next iteration. There are no other states that need to be adjusted, as `prefix_balances` is already defined as a list of length `n + 1` with the required conditions.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2 or 0; `i` is 3**
