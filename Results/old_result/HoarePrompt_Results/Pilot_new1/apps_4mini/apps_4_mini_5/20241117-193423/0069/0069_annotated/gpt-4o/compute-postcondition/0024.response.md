The code appends `0` to the list `results`. The variable `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and the variable `balance` is still equal to 0. The value `x` is not relevant in this context since it is not present in `prefix_balances`. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `0` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional 0**.
