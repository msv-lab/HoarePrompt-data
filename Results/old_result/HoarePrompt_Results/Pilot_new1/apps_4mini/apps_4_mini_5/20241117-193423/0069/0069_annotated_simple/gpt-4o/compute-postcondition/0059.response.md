The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The values of the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been added to `results` while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `T` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, and `results` now includes -1.**
