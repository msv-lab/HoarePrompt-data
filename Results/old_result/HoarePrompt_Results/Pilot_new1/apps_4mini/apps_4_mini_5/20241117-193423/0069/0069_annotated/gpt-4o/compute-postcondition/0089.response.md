The statement assigns a value to `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character in the string `s` at the index `i - 1`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known to be 0 (since all elements are initially set to 0), and the value of `s[i - 1]` will determine whether we add 1 or subtract 1. 

If `s[0]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[1]` is 1, and if `s[0]` is '1', then `prefix_balances[1]` is -1. Therefore, depending on the value of `s[i - 1]` (which is `s[1]`), we will either add 1 or subtract 1 from `prefix_balances[1]`.

1. If `s[1]` is '0', then:
   - `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
2. If `s[1]` is '1', then:
   - `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`

Thus, the final state will depend on the value of `s[1]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- If `s[1]` is '0': `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `prefix_balances[1]` is 1, `prefix_balances[2]` is 2, `i` is 2.
- If `s[1]` is '1': `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `prefix_balances[1]` is 1, `prefix_balances[2]` is 0, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2 or 0; `i` is 2**
