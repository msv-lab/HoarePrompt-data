According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the state of the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The conditions provided indicate that `results` can be empty if certain criteria regarding `balance`, `prefix_balances`, or `T` are not met. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `results` contains at least one element. This can happen in two scenarios:

1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1, which would make `results` non-empty.
2. If `balance` is not 0, then `count` should be greater than 0, which means there are valid indices in `prefix_balances`, leading to at least one valid result being added to `results`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:

- `results` must be a non-empty list (with at least one element).
- If `balance` is 0, then `x` must be present in `prefix_balances`.
- If `balance` is not 0, then `count` must be greater than 0.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances` or `balance` is not 0 and `count` is greater than 0**
