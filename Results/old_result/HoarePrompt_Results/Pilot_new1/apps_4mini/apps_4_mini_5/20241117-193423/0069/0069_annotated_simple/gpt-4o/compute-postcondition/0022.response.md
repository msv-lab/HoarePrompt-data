The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of the variables `prefix_balances` and `balance` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been added to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element in the `prefix_balances` list, and `-1` has been appended to `results`**
