Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is an integer. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
