Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is not equal to 0. If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`, and for `i` from 2 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated as `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '0' or `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '1'. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains as a list of zeros with length 1 (i.e., `[0]`).***
