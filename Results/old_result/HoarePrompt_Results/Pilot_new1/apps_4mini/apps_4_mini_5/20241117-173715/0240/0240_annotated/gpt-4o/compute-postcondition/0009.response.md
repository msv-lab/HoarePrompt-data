According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The loop will execute for each unique permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` is generated in the loop, we need to ensure that for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next permutation of `chars`.

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` represents the last permutation that was generated. To execute the loop again, we need to ensure that there is at least one more permutation to process. This means that the state of `chars` remains unchanged, and we need to adjust `perm` to represent the next permutation in the sequence.

Since `sub` is a non-empty substring and `chars` is a string of digits, both `chars` and `sub` remain unchanged for the next iteration. The state of `perm` must reflect the next permutation that will be generated by the loop.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`**
