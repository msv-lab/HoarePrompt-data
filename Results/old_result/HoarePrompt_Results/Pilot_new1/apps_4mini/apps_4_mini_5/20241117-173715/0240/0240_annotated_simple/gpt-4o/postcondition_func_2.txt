The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty substring of digits `sub`. It generates all permutations of `chars`, checks each permutation to see if it is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, and yields valid candidates. If `chars` is empty or contains only leading zeroes, no permutations are generated or yielded. The function does not return a list; instead, it yields valid candidates one at a time, making it a generator.
