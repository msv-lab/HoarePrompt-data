The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of the list or iterable `perm` into a single string. The initial state indicates that `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, which is a string of digits. Therefore, `candidate` will be a string formed by joining the characters in `perm`. The values of `chars` and `sub` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the elements of `perm`**
