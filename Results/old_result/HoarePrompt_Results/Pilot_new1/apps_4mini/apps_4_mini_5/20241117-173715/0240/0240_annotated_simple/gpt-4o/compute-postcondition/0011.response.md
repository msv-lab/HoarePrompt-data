The code uses the `yield` statement to produce a value from a generator function. Here, `candidate` is yielded, which is the string formed by joining `perm`. The value of `candidate` is not specified in the initial state, but it is derived from `perm`. The `yield` statement does not change the state of the other variables, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**.
