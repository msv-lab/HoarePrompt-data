According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` variable. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the string `chars`. For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character, which is guaranteed since it is stated that `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000. 

However, since `sub` is a non-empty substring, we can also consider that it might be relevant for the context of the loop, even though it doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop itself. The loop variable `perm` will represent each permutation of the `chars` string.

At the start of the loop, we can assume `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, which will be the original string `chars` itself.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars` (which is `chars` itself)**
