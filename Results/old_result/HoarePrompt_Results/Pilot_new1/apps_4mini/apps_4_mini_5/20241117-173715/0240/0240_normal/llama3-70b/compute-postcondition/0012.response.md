According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of digits with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the third character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 4 characters, and `c` should be the fourth character in `s`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since the values of `t`, `t_set`, and `n` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with at least 4 characters, `c` is the fourth character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, and `n` remains unchanged**
