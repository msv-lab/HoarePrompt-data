Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the elements of `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, no action is taken, and the function does not yield any value.***
