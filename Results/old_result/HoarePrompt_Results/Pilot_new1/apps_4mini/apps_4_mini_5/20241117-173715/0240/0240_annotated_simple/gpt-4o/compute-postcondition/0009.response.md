According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is another permutation of `chars` available. Since `perm` is currently the next permutation, we need to adjust the state to indicate that there are still more permutations to be generated.

Given that `perm` is the next permutation, we need to adjust it to reflect that it is now the current permutation being evaluated. The next permutation will be the subsequent one in the sequence of permutations of `chars`.

Therefore, we need to keep `chars` as a non-empty string of digits, but we need to state that there is still another permutation available. Specifically, we can state that `perm` is the next permutation after the current one.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and there are more permutations available**
