The variable `t_set` is assigned the value of `set(t)`, which creates a set of unique characters from the string `t`. Since `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` will contain the unique digits present in `t`. The state of the other variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`**
