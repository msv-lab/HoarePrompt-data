The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates all characters in the string `perm` into a single string. The state of `chars` and `perm` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
