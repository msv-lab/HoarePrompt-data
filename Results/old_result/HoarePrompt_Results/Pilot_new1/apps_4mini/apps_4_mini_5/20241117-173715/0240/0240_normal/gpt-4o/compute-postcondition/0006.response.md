The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means it is formed by joining the elements of `perm` into a single string. The initial state indicates that `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, so `candidate` will be that specific permutation as a string.

Since `chars` is a string of digits with at least one character, and `perm` is defined as the second permutation of `chars`, the exact value of `candidate` will depend on the specific digits in `chars`. However, the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
