The `yield` statement produces a value to be returned from a generator function. In this case, `candidate` is yielded, which means the function will pause and return the value of `candidate` to the caller without terminating the function. The other variables (`chars` and `perm`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`**
