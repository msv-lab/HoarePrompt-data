According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The variable `perm` represents the next permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` is already the next permutation at the end of the last iteration, it implies that there are more permutations to be generated.

The loop will continue to execute as long as there are remaining permutations of `chars`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that `perm` will take the next permutation from the sequence of permutations generated by `permutations(chars)`.

Given that `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the next permutation after `perm` will need to be adjusted accordingly. Thus, we need to ensure that `perm` reflects the next permutation in the sequence.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
