The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '0'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables and the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the output is '0'**
