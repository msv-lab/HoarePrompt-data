The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string `?`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The value of `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`), and the output is '?'**
