The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The value of `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, and `z` is also an integer between 0 and 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be an integer between 0 and 200 (since the minimum value occurs when both `x` and `z` are 0, and the maximum value occurs when both are 100). The states of the other variables (`y` and `min_upvotes`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200**
