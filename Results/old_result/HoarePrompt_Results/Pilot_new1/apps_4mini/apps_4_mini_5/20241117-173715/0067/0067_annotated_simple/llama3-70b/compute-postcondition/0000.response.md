The code assigns the values to `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input provided. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are overwritten by the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as integers from the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from the input, and their values are within the range 0 to 100**
