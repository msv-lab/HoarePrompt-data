Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, representing minimum upvotes, minimum downvotes, and additional votes, respectively. It calculates the maximum possible upvotes (`x + z`) and maximum possible downvotes (`y + z`) and prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, or '?' if neither condition is met. The function does not return any value. **
