The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates on three integers: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Since the output behavior of the function is not provided, we cannot detail any specific return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined without additional output information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but operates on three integers x, y, and z constrained between 0 and 100. The return value is not specified.**
