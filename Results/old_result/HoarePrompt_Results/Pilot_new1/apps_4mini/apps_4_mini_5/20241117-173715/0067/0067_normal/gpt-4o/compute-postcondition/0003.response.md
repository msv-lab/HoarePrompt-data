The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` (input integer), `y` (input integer), and `z` (input integer). The values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**.
