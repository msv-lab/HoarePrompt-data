Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'; if `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'; if `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, the output is '0'; otherwise, the output is '?'. In all other cases, including when `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the output is '?', ensuring that all scenarios are covered, including edge cases where `z` is zero.***
