To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program is supposed to determine the voting result based on three integers:
- `x`: number of upvotes
- `y`: number of downvotes
- `z`: number of unknown votes

The output should be:
- "+" if upvotes are definitively more than downvotes,
- "-" if downvotes are definitively more than upvotes,
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes,
- "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
min_upvotes = x
max_upvotes = x + z
min_downvotes = y
max_downvotes = y + z

if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Minimum and Maximum Votes Calculation**:
   - `min_upvotes = x`: The minimum upvotes are the known upvotes.
   - `max_upvotes = x + z`: The maximum upvotes can be all unknown votes being upvotes.
   - `min_downvotes = y`: The minimum downvotes are the known downvotes.
   - `max_downvotes = y + z`: The maximum downvotes can be all unknown votes being downvotes.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it correctly concludes that downvotes are definitively more (`print('-')`).
   - If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it correctly concludes that upvotes are definitively more (`print('+')`).
   - If neither condition is met, it indicates uncertainty (`print('?')`).

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - Here, `max_upvotes = 1` and `max_downvotes = 1`. The result is uncertain because the unknown vote could swing either way. The program outputs "?" which is correct.
  
- **Case 2**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, and `max_downvotes = 1`. The result is "0" which is correct.

- **Case 3**: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
  - Here, the result is definitively "-", as there are more downvotes than upvotes. The program outputs "-" which is correct.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state:
- The function prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes.
- It prints '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes.
- It prints '?' if neither condition is met.

These hints align perfectly with the logic implemented in the code. 

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It accurately determines the voting result based on the conditions specified.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
