The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `?` to the console. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, `z` are input integers, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the string `?` is printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the string `?` is printed.**
