The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through user input and prints a character based on their values. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is not equal to `y`. In all other cases, including when `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it prints '?'. The function does not return any value.
