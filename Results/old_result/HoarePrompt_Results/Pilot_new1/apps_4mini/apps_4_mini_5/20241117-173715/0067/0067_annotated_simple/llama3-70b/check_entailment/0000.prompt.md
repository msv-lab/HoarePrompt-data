You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `z` is equal to 0, the function prints '0'. If `z` is greater than 0, the function prints '?'. In all cases, `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is equal to 0, the function prints '0'. If `z` is greater than 0, the function prints '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the function prints '?'. In all cases, `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen ('-') is printed. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is equal to 0, '0' is printed; otherwise, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than `y`, '?' is printed. In all cases, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen ('-') is printed. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is equal to 0, '0' is printed; otherwise, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, '?' is printed. In all cases, it holds that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
