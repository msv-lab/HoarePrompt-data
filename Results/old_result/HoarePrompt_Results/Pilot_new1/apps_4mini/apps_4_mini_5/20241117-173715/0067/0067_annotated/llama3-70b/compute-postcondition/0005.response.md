The `print('-')` statement outputs a string consisting of a single hyphen. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the hyphen has been printed, but the values of the variables are still as described.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the hyphen '-' has been printed.**
