The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from input, where the input consists of three integers separated by spaces. The values of these integers will replace the current values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values**
