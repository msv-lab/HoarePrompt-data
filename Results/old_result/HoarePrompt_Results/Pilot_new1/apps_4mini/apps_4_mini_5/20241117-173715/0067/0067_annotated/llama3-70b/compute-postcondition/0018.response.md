The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output provided, it is implied that the function will return a value based on the internal logic that likely involves the integers `x`, `y`, and `z` which are constrained to the range of 0 to 100. However, the exact output conditions or return values based on `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified in the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without additional information on how these parameters influence the return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified in the provided information.**
