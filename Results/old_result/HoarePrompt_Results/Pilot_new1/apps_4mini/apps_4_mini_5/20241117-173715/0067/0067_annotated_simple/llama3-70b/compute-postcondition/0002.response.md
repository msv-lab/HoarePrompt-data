The code executes a print statement that outputs the character '+'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, as well as the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100; `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`; and the output is '+'**
