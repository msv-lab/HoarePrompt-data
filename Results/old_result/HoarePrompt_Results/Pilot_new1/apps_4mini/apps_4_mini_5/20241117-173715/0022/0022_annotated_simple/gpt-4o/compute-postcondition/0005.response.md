According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the condition for the loop.

Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. Additionally, since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we do not need to change `n` because it is still sufficient for the loop's condition.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
