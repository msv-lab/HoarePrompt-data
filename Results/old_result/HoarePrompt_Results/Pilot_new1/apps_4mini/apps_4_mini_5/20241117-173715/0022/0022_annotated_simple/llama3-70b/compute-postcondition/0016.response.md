According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. Therefore, `n // 2` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because the string `s` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 3**
