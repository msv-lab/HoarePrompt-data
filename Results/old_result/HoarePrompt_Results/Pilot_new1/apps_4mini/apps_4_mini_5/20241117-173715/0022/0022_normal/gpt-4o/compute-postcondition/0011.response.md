According to the code, the loop executes while `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 4. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition for the loop:

- The loop condition is `i < n // 2`.
- Given that `n` is at least 4, `n // 2` is at least 2.

Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`. Thus, we need to adjust `i` to 3 to allow for the next iteration. Additionally, since `n` is not specified to change, it can remain at least 4.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be increased to 3.

State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3**
