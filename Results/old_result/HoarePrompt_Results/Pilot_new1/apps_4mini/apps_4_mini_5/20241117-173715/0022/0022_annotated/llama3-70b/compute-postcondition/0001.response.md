The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, which calculates the length of the input string `s`. The value of `s` is a new input string consisting of only English letters, so `len(s)` will yield a non-negative integer representing the number of characters in the string. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `s` is a new input string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of that string.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of that string**
