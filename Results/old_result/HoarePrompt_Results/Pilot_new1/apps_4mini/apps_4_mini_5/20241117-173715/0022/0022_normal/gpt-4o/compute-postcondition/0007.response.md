Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If these characters are equal, the function does not return anything, indicating that the condition for returning False was not met.***
