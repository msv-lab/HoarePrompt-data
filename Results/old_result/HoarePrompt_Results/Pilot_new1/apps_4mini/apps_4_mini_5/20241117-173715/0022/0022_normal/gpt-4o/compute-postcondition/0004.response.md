Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i` of `s`, the function returns False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the characters are equal, there is no return value, and the function may continue executing beyond this point.***
