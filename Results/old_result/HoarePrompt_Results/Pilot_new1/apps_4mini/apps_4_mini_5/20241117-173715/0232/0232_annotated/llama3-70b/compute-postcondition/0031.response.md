Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, if all values in `window_counts` (sorted) are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `found` remains False, `i` is still 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is still 0, with `window_counts[color]` incremented by 1.***
