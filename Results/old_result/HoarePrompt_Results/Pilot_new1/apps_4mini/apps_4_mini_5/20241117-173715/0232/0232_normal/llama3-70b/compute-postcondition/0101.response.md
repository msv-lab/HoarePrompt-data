Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. `window_counts[color]` is now 0 if `color` was not present before. `colors` remains a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. In the case where `color` is already in `window_counts`, no changes are made to `window_counts`.***
