The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is undefined, `color` is undefined, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is undefined, `color` is undefined, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
