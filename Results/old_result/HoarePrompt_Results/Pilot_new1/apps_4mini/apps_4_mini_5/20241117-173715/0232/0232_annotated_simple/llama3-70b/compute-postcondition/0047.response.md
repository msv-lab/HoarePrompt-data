Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` remains True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, the program continues execution without changing `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `color`, or `window_counts`.***
