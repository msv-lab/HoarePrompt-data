Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`; `colors` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; and if `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0 if it was not already present in `window_counts`.***
