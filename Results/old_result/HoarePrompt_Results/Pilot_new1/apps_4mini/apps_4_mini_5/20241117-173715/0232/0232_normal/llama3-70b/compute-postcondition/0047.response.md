Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `j` is `i + 2`. Additionally, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.***
