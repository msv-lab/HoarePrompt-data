Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the conditions are not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the state of `window_counts` is updated accordingly.***
