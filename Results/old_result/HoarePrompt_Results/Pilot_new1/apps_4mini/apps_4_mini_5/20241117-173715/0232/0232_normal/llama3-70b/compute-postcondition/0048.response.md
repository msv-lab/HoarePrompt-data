According to the code, the loop iterates from `i` to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. Since `i` and `n` remain unchanged, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

Given that `j` is currently `i + 2`, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is equal to `i + 2` and still less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `i + 2` for the loop to continue. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is already set based on the previous iteration, and `window_counts[color]` has already been incremented.

State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`**
