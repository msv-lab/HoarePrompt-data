The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the other variables (`desired_counts` and `current_counts`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int), and `left` is 0.

Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int), and `left` is 0**
