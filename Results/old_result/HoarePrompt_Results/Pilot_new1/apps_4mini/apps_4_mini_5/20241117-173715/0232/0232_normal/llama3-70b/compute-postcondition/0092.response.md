Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary or has `color` as a key with a value of 0, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is `i`, and `color` is `colors[j]`. If `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`, it is now added with a value of 0. If `color` was already present, `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
