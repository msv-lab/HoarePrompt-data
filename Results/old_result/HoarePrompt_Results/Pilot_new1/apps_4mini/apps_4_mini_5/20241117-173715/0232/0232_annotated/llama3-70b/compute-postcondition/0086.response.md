According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the current value of `i`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that if `n` is equal to or less than `i`, the loop does not execute, which means `i` is currently equal to or greater than `n`. Given that `found` remains True and both `i` and `j` remain unchanged, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `i` remains unchanged, we can adjust `n` to be greater than `i`.

State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is True, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`**
