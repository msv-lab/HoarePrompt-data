The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
