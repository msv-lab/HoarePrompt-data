Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1, if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` is equal to `i + 1.***
