Postcondition: ***If the counts of the sorted values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `found`, `i`, `n`, or `j`, and `window_counts[color]` remains 2.***
