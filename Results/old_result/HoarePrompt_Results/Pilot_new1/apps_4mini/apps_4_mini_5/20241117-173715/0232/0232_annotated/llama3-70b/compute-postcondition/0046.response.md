The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
