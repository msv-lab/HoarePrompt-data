Output State: **`current_counts` is updated for each color at the index `right`, `left` is incremented by the number of iterations of the inner while loop, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented accordingly. If `current_counts[color]` matches `desired_counts[color]` for each color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES' and the loop does not execute. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and all counts remain unchanged. If `n` is greater than 100, it is outside the defined range, but the loop structure does not handle this case, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. If `colors` contains only one color, the loop may not execute if the counts do not meet the desired counts.**
