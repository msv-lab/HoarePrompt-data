Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop breaks, leaving `window_counts` unchanged with counts of colors from the `colors` list, while `i` and `n` remain unchanged. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being an empty dictionary, `found` being True, and both `i` and `n` remaining unchanged. If the loop executes but the condition is never met, `found` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is still greater than `i`.***
