Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `window_counts` unchanged, `found` remains True, and both `i` and `j` remain unchanged. If `n` is equal to or less than `i`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being an empty dictionary, `found` remaining False, and `i` and `j` remaining unchanged.***
