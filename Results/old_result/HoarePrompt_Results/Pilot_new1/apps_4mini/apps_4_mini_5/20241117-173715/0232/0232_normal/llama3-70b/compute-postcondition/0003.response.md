The code initializes an empty dictionary `color_counts`. This does not affect the previous values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, or `counts`, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts`, along with the new state of `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers derived from input, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary {}**
