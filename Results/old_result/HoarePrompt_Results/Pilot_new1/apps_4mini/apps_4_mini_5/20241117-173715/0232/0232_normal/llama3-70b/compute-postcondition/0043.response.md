Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, and if `color` was not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
