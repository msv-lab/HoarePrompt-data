Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors from 1 to m to their corresponding values in k, and `current_counts` has at least one color count greater than or equal to its corresponding value in `desired_counts`. If all values in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it does not return anything.***
