Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating that the desired condition is met. If this condition is satisfied, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `n` remains greater than `i`, `j` continues to equal `i + 1`, `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1. If the condition is not satisfied, `found` remains False, and the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `color`, and `window_counts` are unchanged.***
