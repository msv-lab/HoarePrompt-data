Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`. If `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is now set to 0. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
