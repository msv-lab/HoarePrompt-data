Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `right` is 0, `left` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. If all `current_counts[color]` match the corresponding `desired_counts[color]` for each color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If there are any discrepancies between `current_counts` and `desired_counts`, the function does not return 'YES'.***
