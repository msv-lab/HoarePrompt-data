Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
