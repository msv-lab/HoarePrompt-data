The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `i` and `j` are unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to their corresponding values in `counts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
