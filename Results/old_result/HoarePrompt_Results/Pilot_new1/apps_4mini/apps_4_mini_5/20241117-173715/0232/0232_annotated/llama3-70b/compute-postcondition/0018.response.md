Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list, and each value is the count of occurrences of that color. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `colors` has at least 1 element, the loop executes for each element in `colors`, updating `color_counts` accordingly.**
