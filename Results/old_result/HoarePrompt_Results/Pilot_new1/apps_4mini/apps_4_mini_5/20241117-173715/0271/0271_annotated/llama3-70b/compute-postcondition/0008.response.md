Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is not divisible by 10. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the output is `n - n % 10`, which is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, the output is `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which is the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
