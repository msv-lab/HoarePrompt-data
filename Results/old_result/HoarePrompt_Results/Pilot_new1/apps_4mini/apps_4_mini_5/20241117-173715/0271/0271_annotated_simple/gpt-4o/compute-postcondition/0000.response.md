The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9. Since the value of `n` will now depend on the input provided, the output state reflects that `n` is now the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
