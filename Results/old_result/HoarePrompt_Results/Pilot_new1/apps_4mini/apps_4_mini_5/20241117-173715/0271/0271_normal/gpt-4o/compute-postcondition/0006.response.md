Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is set to `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is set to `n + (10 - remainder)`. This ensures that `result` represents the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`, rounding down if the last digit is 5 or less, and rounding up if the last digit is greater than 5.***
