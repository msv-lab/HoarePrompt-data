Given the initial state where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, we know that `result` has been calculated based on the value of `remainder`. However, the code provided only prints `result` without performing any calculation or assignment.

Since `result` is not defined in the code snippet provided, we cannot determine its value directly. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `result` is printed but not defined.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is printed but not defined.**
