The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, not a multiple of 10, and the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the operation will effectively reduce `n` to the nearest lower multiple of 10.

Since `n` can be expressed as `10k + d`, where `d` is the last digit (0 ≤ d ≤ 5), the expression simplifies to `10k`, which is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the value of `n` and the calculated result from the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5; the result of `print(n - n % 10)` is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`.**
