Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input from the user, rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10, and prints the result. If the input's last digit is 5 or less, it rounds down; if it is greater than 5, it rounds up. The function does not handle any input validation, so if the input is not a valid integer, an error will occur. **
