The code calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10 and its last digit is greater than 5, we can determine the last digit of `n` to be either 6, 7, 8, or 9.

1. The expression `n % 10` gives the last digit of `n`.
2. Since the last digit is greater than 5, `10 - n % 10` will yield a positive integer less than 4 (specifically 4, 3, 2, or 1).
3. Therefore, `n + (10 - n % 10)` effectively rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10.

The output will be `n` plus the difference needed to reach the next multiple of 10.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is not divisible by 10. The last digit of `n` is greater than 5; the output is `n + (10 - n % 10)` which is the next multiple of 10.**
