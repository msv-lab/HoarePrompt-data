Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input from the user and calculates the nearest multiple of 10 based on the last digit of the input. If the last digit is 5 or less, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10; if the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10. The function does not handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs, which could lead to errors. **
