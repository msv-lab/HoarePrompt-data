To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step alongside the requirements.

**Problem description:** 
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` already ends with 0, it is considered rounded. The rounding rules state:
- If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, round down to the nearest multiple of 10.
- If the last digit is greater than 5, round up to the nearest multiple of 10.

**Program:**
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

**Output hints:** 
The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` and prints the nearest multiple of 10. It correctly identifies and handles the cases where:
- If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n`.
- If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n`.
- If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`.

**Analysis:**
1. **Case when `n` is 0:** 
   - Input: `0`
   - Output: `0` (correct, as it is already rounded)

2. **Case when `n` is a multiple of 10 (e.g., 10, 20, 100):**
   - Input: `10`
   - Output: `10` (correct, already rounded)

3. **Case when the last digit is less than or equal to 5 (e.g., 5, 15, 25):**
   - Input: `5`
   - Output: `0` (correct, rounds down)
   - Input: `15`
   - Output: `10` (correct, rounds down)
   - Input: `25`
   - Output: `20` (correct, rounds down)

4. **Case when the last digit is greater than 5 (e.g., 6, 16, 26):**
   - Input: `6`
   - Output: `10` (correct, rounds up)
   - Input: `16`
   - Output: `20` (correct, rounds up)
   - Input: `26`
   - Output: `30` (correct, rounds up)

5. **Edge cases at boundaries (e.g., 5 and 15):** 
   - As shown, both cases handle rounding correctly.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. The output hints align with the code functionality, and all edge cases have been considered.

Correctness: **True**.
