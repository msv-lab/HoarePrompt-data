To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

1. We have the initial values: `n`, `m`, `k` as positive integers from input; `a` and `b` are also input integers.
2. The calculations for `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` are already defined in the initial state:
   - `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
   - `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`
   - `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
3. The code snippet computes `min_block_time` as:
   ```
   min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
   ```

Now, `min_block_time` is assigned the minimum value between:
- The absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, `abs(a_block - b_block)`.
- The difference `n - abs(a_block - b_block)`, which accounts for wrapping around.

After calculating the minimum of these two values, we multiply the result by 15 to get `min_block_time`.

Since the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not specified but are positive integers, we can't provide exact numeric results. However, we can describe the relationships and final state of the variables.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculations done:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15**
