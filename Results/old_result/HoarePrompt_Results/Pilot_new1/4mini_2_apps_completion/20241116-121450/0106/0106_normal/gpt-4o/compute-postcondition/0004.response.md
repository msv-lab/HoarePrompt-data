The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The parameter `apartment` is an integer that represents a specific location within a building structure defined by the positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the values of `block` and `floor` based on the given parameters and derived values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` values based on the calculations involving the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the values of block and floor based on calculations involving the dimensions of the building and the apartment number.**
