The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input, which are two integers. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers, and they must be distinct and within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` do not change, and the initial values of `a` and `b` are replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input; `a` and `b` are the new input integers satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b**
