Postcondition: ***`a_floor` is calculated as ((`a` - 1) % `m`) + 1 and `b_floor` cannot be evaluated. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In either case, `min_floor_time` will always be at least 10, reflecting the minimum time taken, and will increase based on the difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`. Additionally, `b_block` is defined as ((`b` - 1) // (`m` * `k`)) + 1, and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(`a_block` - `b_block`), `n` - abs(`a_block` - `b_block`)) * 15.***
