The value of `min_floor_time` is assigned as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. We know that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, but we do not have specific values for `a_floor` and `b_floor`. Therefore, the exact numerical result cannot be calculated, but we can express the relationship.

The output state will reflect that `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`, multiplied by 5, and then increased by 10. 

Output State: **`a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
