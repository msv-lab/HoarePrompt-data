The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on user input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers. The initial state indicates that `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range of 1 to `nÂ·mÂ·k`. Therefore, after execution, `a` and `b` will hold the values provided by the user input. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on user input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers based on user input.**
