The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` represents an element from the `data` list at the position `index`. The `int` function converts this element into an integer. The values of `prefix_balances`, `results`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, `results` has increased by 1, `T` is greater than 1, and `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, `results` has increased by 1, `T` is greater than 1, and `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.**
