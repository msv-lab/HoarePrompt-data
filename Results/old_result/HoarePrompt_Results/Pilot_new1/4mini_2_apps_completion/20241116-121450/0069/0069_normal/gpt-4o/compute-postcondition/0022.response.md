The code appends `-1` to the list `results`. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, but it does not affect the `results` list or any other variables directly. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `-1` has been added to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers; `results` now includes -1**
