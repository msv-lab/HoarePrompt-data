Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1, indicating that the condition was satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 balances, and `b` is the second balance in `prefix_balances`.***
