The variable `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list containing `n + 1` zeros. The previous state indicates that `n` has been assigned an integer value from `data[index]`, but the specific value of `n` is not provided. Therefore, the length of `prefix_balances` will depend on the value of `n`. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `results` has increased by 1, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned an integer value from `data[index]`, `x` is assigned an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `balance` is calculated based on the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`.**
