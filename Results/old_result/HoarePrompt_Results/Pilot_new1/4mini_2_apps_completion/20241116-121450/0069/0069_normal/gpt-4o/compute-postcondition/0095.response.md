Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance after processing the first `i` characters of `s`. The value of `balance` is 0. The value `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and if `n` is at least 1, then `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`, with subsequent elements updated based on the characters processed. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros.***
