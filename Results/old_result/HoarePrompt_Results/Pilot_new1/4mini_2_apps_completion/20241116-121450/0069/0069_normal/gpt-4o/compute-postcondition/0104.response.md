The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `count` is 1, `b` is `prefix_balances[0]`, the value of `x - b` is divisible by `balance`, and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative.**
