The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` will be 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[2]`, `s` is the value from `data[3]`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `index` is 4, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[2]`, `s` is the value from `data[3]`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `index` is 4, and `results` is an empty list**.
