According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop has reached its final iteration. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`. The state of `prefix_balances` does not need to be adjusted because it remains unchanged for `prefix_balances[0]`, and the conditions for `prefix_balances[1]` and `prefix_balances[i]` are already satisfied based on the information provided.

State: **`prefix_balances[0]` is unchanged; `prefix_balances[1]` is either `prefix_balances[0] + 1` or `prefix_balances[0] - 1`; `i` is `n + 1`; `prefix_balances[i]` is either `prefix_balances[n] + 1` or `prefix_balances[n] - 1`**
