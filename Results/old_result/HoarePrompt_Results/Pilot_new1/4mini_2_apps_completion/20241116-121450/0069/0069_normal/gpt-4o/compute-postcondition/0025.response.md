Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index from 1 to n. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. If `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` has an additional element 0 appended. This accounts for all cases, including when `prefix_balances` is empty or contains only values that do not match `x`.***
