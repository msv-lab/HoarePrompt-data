The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The current value of `index` is 1, so `index + 2` equals 3. Therefore, `s` will be assigned the value from `data[3]`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged. 

Since `data` is a list containing input values split by whitespace, the output state will reflect the assignment of `s` based on the value from `data[3]`. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[2]`, `s` is the value from `data[3]`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list**.
