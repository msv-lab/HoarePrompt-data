According to the code, the loop executes for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`, inclusive. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100) and the other variables (`data`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `index`, `results`, and `prefix_balances`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, we only need to ensure that `n` is at least 1. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` should start at 1, which is the first value in the specified range. 

Therefore, to summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute:

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all 0s**
