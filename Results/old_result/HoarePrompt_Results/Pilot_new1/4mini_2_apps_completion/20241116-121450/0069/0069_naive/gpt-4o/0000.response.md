To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to calculate the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t` (which is the string `s` repeated infinitely) that have a specific balance `x`.
   - The balance of a string is defined as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's.
   - We need to consider both finite and infinite cases.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the balance of the string `s` and the prefix balances.
   - It checks if the overall balance is zero and if `x` is present in the prefix balances. If so, it returns `-1` for infinite prefixes.
   - If the balance is not zero, it counts how many prefixes can achieve the balance `x` by checking if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and ensuring the result is non-negative.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix balances and checks for the infinite case when `balance` is zero.
   - However, it does not correctly handle situations where the balance of the string `s` is zero but `x` is not in the prefix balances. In this case, it should also return `-1` since any prefix can be extended infinitely without changing the balance.
   - The program does not account for cases where the balance can lead to negative indices when calculating the prefixes.

4. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4 0
     0000
     ```
     Here, `s = "0000"` has a balance of `4` (4 zeros and 0 ones). The expected output is `-1` because there are infinitely many prefixes that can achieve a balance of `0` (by taking any number of zeros).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program fails to handle cases where the balance is zero correctly and does not return `-1` in all appropriate situations. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
