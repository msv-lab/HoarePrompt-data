The line `prefix_balances = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes the list `prefix_balances` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The variable `n` is not provided in the initial state, but it is implied to be a non-negative integer since it determines the size of the list. Other variables (`balance`, `x`, `results`, `T`, `s`, `index`) are not affected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`balance` is updated based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` includes -1, `T` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all 0s.**
