Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `T` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, determines the balance between these counts, and based on the balance and the value of `x`, it prints different results: `n + 1` if the balance equals `x`, `-1` if the counts of '0's and '1's are equal but do not match the desired balance, and a calculated value otherwise. The function does not return any values but prints results directly to the output. Edge cases include handling when the counts of '0's and '1's are equal, and ensuring valid input constraints.**
