According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (the loop starts at 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted since we only need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `i` is 2**
