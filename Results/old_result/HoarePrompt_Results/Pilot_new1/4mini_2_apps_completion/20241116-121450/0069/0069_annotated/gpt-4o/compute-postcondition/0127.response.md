Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `T` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes an integer `n` (the length of a binary string), an integer `x` (the desired balance), and a binary string `s`. It calculates the balance of `s` (the difference between the count of '0's and '1's) and constructs a list of prefix balances. If the balance is zero, it checks if `x` is in the prefix balances and returns -1 if true, or 0 if false. If the balance is not zero, it counts how many prefix balances can yield a non-negative multiple of the balance when subtracted from `x`, and returns this count. The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0, ensuring that results are accurately computed and printed.**
