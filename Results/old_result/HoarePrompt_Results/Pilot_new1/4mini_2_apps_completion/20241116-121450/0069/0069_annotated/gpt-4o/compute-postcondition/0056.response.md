Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i-1`. If `s` has a length of 0 (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains as a list of length 1 initialized to all 0s. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` such that `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '0' or `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '1'.**
