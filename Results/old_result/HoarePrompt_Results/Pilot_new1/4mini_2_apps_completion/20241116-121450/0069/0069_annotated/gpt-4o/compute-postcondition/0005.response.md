According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `T` is already defined as a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. The `index` is set to 1, which is the starting value for the loop iterations. The `results` list is empty before the loop starts, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

To summarize, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are already satisfied by the provided state. The `index` will be used within the loop, starting at 1, and will increment with each iteration. 

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
