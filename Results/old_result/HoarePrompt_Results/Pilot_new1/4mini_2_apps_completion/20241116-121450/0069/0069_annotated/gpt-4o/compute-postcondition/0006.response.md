The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The variable `index` is 1, but the value of `data` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. The other variables `T` and `results` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])` (where `data[1]` is unknown).

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])` (where `data[1]` is unknown)**
