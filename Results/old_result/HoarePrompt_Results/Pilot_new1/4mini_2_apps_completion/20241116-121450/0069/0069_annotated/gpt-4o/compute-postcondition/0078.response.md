Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative; `results` includes this `count`. In all cases, edge cases such as `balance` being 0 or `prefix_balances` being empty (when `n` is 0) are handled appropriately.***
