According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Given that `T` is a positive integer and does not affect the loop execution directly, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

Before the loop starts, `index` is 4, which is irrelevant to the loop itself, and `results` is an empty list, which also does not affect the loop execution. The variables `x`, `s`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances` are also defined but do not impact whether the loop executes.

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, we can state that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and since the loop variable `i` will start at 1, we can set `i` to 1.

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
