Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i-1`. The balance is not equal to 0, indicating that the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` are not balanced. If `n` is 0, `prefix_balances` remains as a list of length 1 initialized to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, resulting in `prefix_balances` reflecting the cumulative balance changes based on the characters in `s`.***
