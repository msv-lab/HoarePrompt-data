Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the result of adding 1 for each '0' and subtracting 1 for each '1' up to index `i`. `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged (all zeros), and `balance` reflects the net result of the characters in `s`.***
