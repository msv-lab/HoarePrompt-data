Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least one non-zero element and `count` is initially 0. If `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
