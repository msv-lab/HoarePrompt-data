The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the result of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known, but the specific value of `s[i - 1]` is not provided. Therefore, depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or '1', `prefix_balances[i]` will either increase by 1 or decrease by 1 from `prefix_balances[i - 1]`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the change in `prefix_balances[i]` based on the evaluation of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`**
