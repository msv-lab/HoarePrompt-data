The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The variable `index` is 1, so `index + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `x` will take the integer value of `data[2]`. The initial values of `T`, `n`, `s`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
