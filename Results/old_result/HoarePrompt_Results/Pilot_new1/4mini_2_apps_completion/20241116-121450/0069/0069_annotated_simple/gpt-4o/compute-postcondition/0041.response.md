Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain -1; if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` will contain the count of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and `results` will be affected accordingly based on the conditions.***
