According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` contains at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 3 elements, and the function prints the third element in `results`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` must contain at least 4 elements. 

No other states need to be adjusted since the other conditions are already satisfied. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `balance` is 0 or non-zero, `x` is in `prefix_balances` or valid conditions for counting in `results` are met, `results` contains at least 4 elements, and the function prints the third element in `results`**
