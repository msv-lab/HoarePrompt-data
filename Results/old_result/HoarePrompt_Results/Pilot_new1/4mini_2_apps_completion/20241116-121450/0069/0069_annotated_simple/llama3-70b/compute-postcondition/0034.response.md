Postcondition: ***`T` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the program avoids division by zero and handles the case appropriately by calculating `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring valid outputs for all scenarios where `cnt0` and `cnt1` may vary.***
