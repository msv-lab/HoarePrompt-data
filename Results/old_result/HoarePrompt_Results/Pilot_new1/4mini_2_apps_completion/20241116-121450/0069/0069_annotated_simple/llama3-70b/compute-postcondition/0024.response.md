Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (2 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the division would be invalid, hence this case should be handled separately to avoid division by zero. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which calculates the number of complete cycles of the balance adjustment needed.***
