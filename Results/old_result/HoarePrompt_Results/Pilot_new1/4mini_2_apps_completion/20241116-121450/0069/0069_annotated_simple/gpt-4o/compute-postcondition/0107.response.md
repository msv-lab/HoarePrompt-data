The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and `b` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `count` is 2, `b` is the next balance in `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `count` is 2, `b` is the next balance in `prefix_balances**
