The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
