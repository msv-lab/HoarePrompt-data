The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input, which is processed by `map(int, input().split())`. The initial state indicates that `T` is a positive integer, but it does not provide specific values for `n` and `x`. Therefore, after execution, the output state reflects the assignment of `n` and `x` from the input. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers**
