The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `s` will be assigned the value of `data[3]`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `s` based on the assignment.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
