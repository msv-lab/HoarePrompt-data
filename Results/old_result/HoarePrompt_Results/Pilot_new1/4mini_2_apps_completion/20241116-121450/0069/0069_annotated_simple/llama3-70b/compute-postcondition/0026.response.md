The values of `n` and `x` are assigned from the input, where `input().split()` accepts two space-separated integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The other variables `T`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `x` as input integers.

Output State: **`T` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
