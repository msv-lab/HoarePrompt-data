The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous state indicates that `results` is currently an empty list. After execution, `results` will contain one element, `-1`. The other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, `T`, and `index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `T` is at least 1, `index` is 4, and `results` is [-1]**
