According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 3. The state of `prefix_balances` and `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and `s[i - 1]`; `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged**
