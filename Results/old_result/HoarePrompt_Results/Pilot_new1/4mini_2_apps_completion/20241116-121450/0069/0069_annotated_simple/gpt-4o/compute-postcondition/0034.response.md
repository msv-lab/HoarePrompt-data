Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `T` is at least 1, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list, and `balance` is not equal to 0. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `(x - b)` is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, then `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
