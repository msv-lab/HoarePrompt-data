The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `results` was an empty list before the execution. After executing the code, `results` will now contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, `T`, and `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0, `T` is at least 1, `index` is 4, and `results` contains the value 0.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0, `T` is at least 1, `index` is 4, and `results` contains the value 0**
