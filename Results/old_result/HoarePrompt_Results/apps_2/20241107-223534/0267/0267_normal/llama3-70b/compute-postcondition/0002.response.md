The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. The function returns the result of `(count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to calculate the count of specific values within a given range (`r` to `l`) based on the value of `k` and a dynamic programming array `dp`, and then return the difference between these counts modulo `MOD`.
