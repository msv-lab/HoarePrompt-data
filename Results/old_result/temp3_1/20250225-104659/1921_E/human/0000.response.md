To create a comprehensive test script for the provided program, we need to consider various scenarios based on the problem description. Since the program is structured to read from standard input and write to standard output, we will use the `run_program_with_captured_io` function to simulate input and capture output.

Here's the complete test script:

```python
import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    ("1\n6 5 2 2 5 3\n", "Alice"),
    ("1\n4 1 2 1 4 1\n", "Bob"),
    ("1\n1 4 1 3 1 1\n", "Draw"),
    ("1\n5 5 1 4 5 2\n", "Draw"),
    ("1\n4 4 1 1 4 4\n", "Draw"),
    ("1\n10 10 1 6 10 8\n", "Alice"),
    ("1\n10 10 2 6 10 7\n", "Draw"),
    ("1\n10 10 9 1 8 1\n", "Draw"),
    ("1\n10 10 8 1 10 2\n", "Bob"),
    ("1\n10 10 1 1 2 1\n", "Alice"),
    ("1\n10 10 1 3 4 1\n", "Alice"),
    ("1\n10 10 3 1 1 1\n", "Draw"),
    # Additional edge cases
    ("1\n1 1 1 1 1 2\n", "Draw"),  # Alice and Bob cannot move
    ("1\n2 2 1 1 2 2\n", "Draw"),  # Alice and Bob cannot move towards each other
    ("1\n2 2 1 2 2 1\n", "Alice"), # Alice can move diagonally to win
    ("1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n", "Draw"),  # Both can move but no winner
    ("1\n3 3 1 2 3 2\n", "Alice"), # Alice can move down to win
    ("1\n3 3 2 1 1 2\n", "Bob"),   # Bob can move up to win
    ("1\n1000000 1000000 1 1 1000000 1000000\n", "Draw"), # Large board, no winner
]

# Run tests
for i, (input_data, expected_output) in enumerate(test_cases):
    assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output, f"Test case {i+1} failed"

print("All test cases passed!")
```

### Explanation:
- **`run_program_with_captured_io` Function**: This function captures the output of the program when given specific input data. It redirects `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` to simulate input and capture output.
- **Test Cases**: A variety of test cases are included to cover different scenarios:
  - Simple cases where Alice or Bob wins.
  - Cases where the game ends in a draw.
  - Edge cases with minimal board sizes and positions where players cannot move.
  - Large board size to ensure the program handles large inputs correctly.
- **Assertions**: Each test case includes an assertion to verify that the output of the program matches the expected result. If any test case fails, an error message will be displayed indicating which test case failed.
- **Final Message**: If all test cases pass, a success message is printed.
