Note: The `func_2` function reads from standard input, so the assertions assume that the input is provided correctly before calling `func_2`. Since the input is read at the start of `func_2`, the input data needs to be set up correctly before each test case. However, since the provided script does not allow for easy resetting of input, we assume that each test case is executed in isolation, which is not feasible in practice without modification. For testing purposes, the input data should be redirected appropriately in a real environment.
