To test the provided program, we need to use the `run_program_with_captured_io` function since the program does not define a function that we can import and call directly. We'll create several test cases based on the problem description and the example provided.

Here's the complete Python script with assertions to test the correctness of the given program:

```python
import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Test cases
input_data_1 = """4\n0 1\n12 4\n57 37\n316560849 14570961"""
expected_output_1 = """1\n8\n4\n33554432"""

input_data_2 = """1\n0 2"""
expected_output_2 = """1"""

input_data_3 = """1\n1 3"""
expected_output_3 = """1"""

input_data_4 = """1\n2 3"""
expected_output_4 = """2"""

input_data_5 = """1\n4 7"""
expected_output_5 = """1"""

# Run the program with the test cases and assert the outputs
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data_1) == expected_output_1
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data_2) == expected_output_2
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data_3) == expected_output_3
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data_4) == expected_output_4
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data_5) == expected_output_5

print("All test cases passed!")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `run_program_with_captured_io` function is defined to capture the standard input and output, execute the program, and return the captured output.
2. **Test Cases**: Several test cases are provided, including the example given in the problem description and additional edge cases.
3. **Assertions**: For each test case, the program is executed with the provided input, and the output is asserted against the expected output.
4. **Output**: If all assertions pass, the message "All test cases passed!" is printed.

This script ensures that the provided program behaves correctly for various inputs.
