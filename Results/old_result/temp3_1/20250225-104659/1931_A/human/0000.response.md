To create a comprehensive test script for the given problem, we need to consider various test cases that cover different scenarios. Since the provided program is a script rather than a function, we will use the `run_program_with_captured_io` function to execute the program and capture its output.

Here's the complete test script:

```python
import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    ("5\n24\n70\n3\n55\n48", "aav\nrzz\naaa\nczz\nauz"),
    ("1\n78", "zzz"),
    ("1\n3", "aaa"),
    ("1\n52", "azy"),
    ("1\n53", "bzz"),
    ("1\n54", "caz"),
    ("1\n55", "czz"),
    ("1\n56", "daz"),
    ("1\n57", "dbz"),
    ("1\n58", "dcz"),
    ("1\n59", "ddz"),
    ("1\n60", "dez"),
    ("1\n61", "dfz"),
    ("1\n62", "dgz"),
    ("1\n63", "dhz"),
    ("1\n64", "diz"),
    ("1\n65", "dzd"),
    ("1\n66", "dze"),
    ("1\n67", "dzf"),
    ("1\n68", "dzg"),
    ("1\n69", "dzh"),
    ("1\n70", "dzi"),
    ("1\n71", "dzj"),
    ("1\n72", "dzk"),
    ("1\n73", "dzl"),
    ("1\n74", "dzm"),
    ("1\n75", "dzn"),
    ("1\n76", "dzo"),
    ("1\n77", "dzp"),
    ("1\n78", "dzq"),
]

# Run tests
for i, (input_data, expected_output) in enumerate(test_cases):
    assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output, f"Test case {i+1} failed"

print("All test cases passed!")
```

### Explanation:
- **run_program_with_captured_io**: This function captures the standard input and output to simulate running the program with given input data.
- **Test Cases**: A list of tuples where each tuple contains the input data and the expected output. These test cases cover a variety of scenarios including edge cases.
- **Assertions**: For each test case, the function `run_program_with_captured_io` is called with the input data, and the output is compared to the expected output using an assertion.
- **Edge Cases**: The test cases include scenarios where the sum is at the minimum (3) and maximum (78), as well as intermediate values to ensure the program handles all possible inputs correctly.

This script ensures that the provided program behaves as expected for the given problem description.
