Your task is to generate a Python script with assertions to test the correctness of a given Python program, based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

The output must be a complete Python script with assertions that verify the program’s correctness. Do not execute the program yourself; just provide the test code.

If the program defines a function, import it and test it by calling the function directly with arguments and using assertions on its return values.

If the program does not define functions but executes directly, use the following helper function to automate input/output capture and execute `program.py` safely:

import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    >>><

    6
    
    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Program:
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')



# Your response:
```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

#if there is a specific function we can call import it
from program import *
#otherwise use the run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) function to run the program and capture the output

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description
# Example:
# assert function_name(input) == expected_output

# or if the program is a script we must execute 
# input_data = "input data"
# expected_output = "expected output"
# assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output 
# Add multiple test cases to ensure correctness across edge cases


# End of script
```
