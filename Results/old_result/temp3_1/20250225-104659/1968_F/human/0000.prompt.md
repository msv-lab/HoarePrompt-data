Your task is to generate a Python script with assertions to test the correctness of a given Python program, based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

The output must be a complete Python script with assertions that verify the program’s correctness. Do not execute the program yourself; just provide the test code.

If the program defines a function, import it and test it by calling the function directly with arguments and using assertions on its return values.

If the program does not define functions but executes directly, use the following helper function to automate input/output capture and execute `program.py` safely:

import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Your response:
```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

#if there is a specific function we can call import it
from program import *
#otherwise use the run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) function to run the program and capture the output

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description
# Example:
# assert function_name(input) == expected_output

# or if the program is a script we must execute 
# input_data = "input data"
# expected_output = "expected output"
# assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output 
# Add multiple test cases to ensure correctness across edge cases


# End of script
```
