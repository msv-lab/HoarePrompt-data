To test the provided program, we need to consider the logic of the program and the constraints given in the problem description. The program calculates the number of different final configurations of rooks on a chessboard after a certain number of moves, considering the rules of the game.

Here's how we can write a complete Python script with assertions to test the correctness of the given program:

```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

# If there is a specific function we can call import it
from program import func_1, helper

# Otherwise use the run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) function to run the program and capture the output
import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description

# Test case 1 from the example
input_data = """3
4 1
1 2
8 1
7 6
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91"""
expected_output = """3
331
671968183"""
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output

# Additional test cases
# Test case 2: No initial moves
input_data = """1
4 0"""
expected_output = """72"""
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output

# Test case 3: Full board filled initially
input_data = """1
4 4
1 2
2 1

4 3"""
expected_output = """1"""
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output

# Test case 4: Diagonal moves only
input_data = """1
4 2
1 1
2 2"""
expected_output = """9"""
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output

# Test case 5: Large board with no initial moves
input_data = """1
1000 0"""
expected_output = str(helper(1000) % (10**9 + 7))
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output

# Test case 6: Large board with some initial moves
input_data = """1
1000 5
1 2
2 1
3 4
4 3
5 5"""
expected_output = str(helper(995) % (10**9 + 7))
assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output

# End of script
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import the necessary functions (`func_1` and `helper`) from `program.py`.
2. **Helper Function**: The `run_program_with_captured_io` function is used to execute the program with given input and capture the output.
3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: This is the example provided in the problem statement.
   - **Test Case 2**: Tests the scenario where no initial moves have been made.
   - **Test Case 3**: Tests the scenario where the board is fully filled with initial moves.
   - **Test Case 4**: Tests the scenario where only diagonal moves have been made.
   - **Test Case 5**: Tests a large board with no initial moves.
   - **Test Case 6**: Tests a large board with some initial moves.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios to ensure the correctness of the program.
