To create a comprehensive test script for the given problem, we need to consider both the function-based approach and the script-based approach. However, the provided program snippet seems to have some issues and doesn't match the problem description perfectly. Specifically, the loop runs up to 13, which is not related to the problem statement. 

Let's assume the correct implementation of the function `func_1` is available in `program.py`, and we will write test cases for it. If the program is meant to be executed as a script, we will also provide a way to test it using the `run_program_with_captured_io` function.

Here's the complete test script:

```python
# Include necessary imports if any
import io
import sys
from program import func_1  # Assuming func_1 is defined in program.py

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Test cases for the function func_1
def test_func_1():
    assert func_1(12) == 3  # 1 + 2 = 3
    assert func_1(1) == 1   # 1 = 1
    assert func_1(2) == 2   # 2 = 2
    assert func_1(3) == 3   # 3 = 3
    assert func_1(1434) == 12  # 1 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 12
    assert func_1(2024) == 8  # 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 8
    assert func_1(200000) == 2  # 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2

# Test cases for the script execution
def test_script():
    input_data = "7\n12\n1\n2\n3\n1434\n2024\n200000"
    expected_output = "51\n1\n3\n6\n18\n12\n8\n2"
    assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output

# Run the tests
test_func_1()
test_script()

print("All tests passed.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function-Based Testing (`func_1`)**:
   - We import `func_1` from `program.py`.
   - We write several test cases to ensure that `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.

2. **Script-Based Testing**:
   - We define `run_program_with_captured_io` to capture the output of the script when given specific input.
   - We prepare a string `input_data` that mimics the input format described in the problem.
   - We compare the captured output of the script with the expected output.

3. **Running Tests**:
   - We call `test_func_1()` to run the function-based tests.
   - We call `test_script()` to run the script-based tests.
   - If all assertions pass, we print "All tests passed."

This script ensures that both the function and the script behave as expected according to the problem description.
