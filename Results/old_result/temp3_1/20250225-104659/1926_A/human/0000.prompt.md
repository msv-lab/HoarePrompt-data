Your task is to generate a Python script with assertions to test the correctness of a given Python program, based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

The output must be a complete Python script with assertions that verify the program’s correctness. Do not execute the program yourself; just provide the test code.

If the program defines a function, import it and test it by calling the function directly with arguments and using assertions on its return values.

If the program does not define functions but executes directly, use the following helper function to automate input/output capture and execute `program.py` safely:

import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Program:
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
    if countA > countB:
        print('A')
    elif countB > countA:
        print('B')
    else:
        pass



# Your response:
```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

#if there is a specific function we can call import it
from program import *
#otherwise use the run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) function to run the program and capture the output

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description
# Example:
# assert function_name(input) == expected_output

# or if the program is a script we must execute 
# input_data = "input data"
# expected_output = "expected output"
# assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output 
# Add multiple test cases to ensure correctness across edge cases


# End of script
```
