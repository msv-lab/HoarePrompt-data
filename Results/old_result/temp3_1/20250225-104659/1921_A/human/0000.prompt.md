Your task is to generate a Python script with assertions to test the correctness of a given Python program, based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

The output must be a complete Python script with assertions that verify the program’s correctness. Do not execute the program yourself; just provide the test code.

If the program defines a function, import it and test it by calling the function directly with arguments and using assertions on its return values.

If the program does not define functions but executes directly, use the following helper function to automate input/output capture and execute `program.py` safely:

import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



# Your response:
```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

#if there is a specific function we can call import it
from program import *
#otherwise use the run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) function to run the program and capture the output

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description
# Example:
# assert function_name(input) == expected_output

# or if the program is a script we must execute 
# input_data = "input data"
# expected_output = "expected output"
# assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output 
# Add multiple test cases to ensure correctness across edge cases


# End of script
```
