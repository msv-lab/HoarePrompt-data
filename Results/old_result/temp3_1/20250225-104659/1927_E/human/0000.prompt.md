Your task is to generate a Python script with assertions to test the correctness of a given Python program, based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

The output must be a complete Python script with assertions that verify the program’s correctness. Do not execute the program yourself; just provide the test code.

If the program defines a function, import it and test it by calling the function directly with arguments and using assertions on its return values.

If the program does not define functions but executes directly, use the following helper function to automate input/output capture and execute `program.py` safely:

import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    while idx < k:
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
        while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
            if idx % 2 == 0:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
                bottom_v += 1
            else:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v

# Your response:
```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

#if there is a specific function we can call import it
from program import *
#otherwise use the run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) function to run the program and capture the output

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description
# Example:
# assert function_name(input) == expected_output

# or if the program is a script we must execute 
# input_data = "input data"
# expected_output = "expected output"
# assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output 
# Add multiple test cases to ensure correctness across edge cases


# End of script
```
