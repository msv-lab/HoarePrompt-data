Certainly! Below is the complete Python script with assertions to test the correctness of the provided program. Since the program defines functions, we can import them and test them directly.

```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.

# If there is a specific function we can call, import it
from program import func_1, func_2

# Write your test cases below
# Each test case should include assertions based on the problem description

# Test case 1 from the example
n1, m1, k1, prices1 = 4, 2, 3, [8, 6, 4, 2]
assert func_1(n1, m1, k1, prices1) == 10, f"Test case 1 failed, expected 10 but got {func_1(n1, m1, k1, prices1)}"

# Test case 2 from the example
n2, m2, k2, prices2 = 4, 2, 8, [8, 6, 4, 2]
assert func_1(n2, m2, k2, prices2) == 64, f"Test case 2 failed, expected 64 but got {func_1(n2, m2, k2, prices2)}"

# Test case 3 from the example
n3, m3, k3, prices3 = 5, 100, 1, [10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]
assert func_1(n3, m3, k3, prices3) == 1, f"Test case 3 failed, expected 1 but got {func_1(n3, m3, k3, prices3)}"

# Test case 4 from the example
n4, m4, k4, prices4 = 6, 3, 9, [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
assert func_1(n4, m4, k4, prices4) == 72, f"Test case 4 failed, expected 72 but got {func_1(n4, m4, k4, prices4)}"

# Additional test cases
# Test case 5: All prices are the same, and we can buy all tickets in one day
n5, m5, k5, prices5 = 3, 10, 3, [5, 5, 5]
assert func_1(n5, m5, k5, prices5) == 15, f"Test case 5 failed, expected 15 but got {func_1(n5, m5, k5, prices5)}"

# Test case 6: Prices increase significantly after buying tickets on the first day
n6, m6, k6, prices6 = 4, 1, 4, [1, 100, 100, 100]
assert func_1(n6, m6, k6, prices6) == 103, f"Test case 6 failed, expected 103 but got {func_1(n6, m6, k6, prices6)}"

# Test case 7: Buying tickets evenly over several days
n7, m7, k7, prices7 = 5, 2, 5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1(n7, m7, k7, prices7) == 15, f"Test case 7 failed, expected 15 but got {func_1(n7, m7, k7, prices7)}"

# Test case 8: Maximum tickets can be bought in one day
n8, m8, k8, prices8 = 3, 10, 30, [1, 2, 3]
assert func_1(n8, m8, k8, prices8) == 180, f"Test case 8 failed, expected 180 but got {func_1(n8, m8, k8, prices8)}"

# Test case 9: Only one day available
n9, m9, k9, prices9 = 1, 10, 5, [10]
assert func_1(n9, m9, k9, prices9) == 50, f"Test case 9 failed, expected 50 but got {func_1(n9, m9, k9, prices9)}"

# Test case 10: Minimum tickets to buy
n10, m10, k10, prices10 = 5, 1, 1, [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
assert func_1(n10, m10, k10, prices10) == 10, f"Test case 10 failed, expected 10 but got {func_1(n10, m10, k10, prices10)}"

# End of script
```

This script includes multiple test cases to ensure the correctness of the `func_1` function, which calculates the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets. Each test case uses an assertion to check if the function's output matches the expected result.
