To test the given program, we need to focus on the function `func_1` which calculates the sum of the digits of a number. The main logic of the program seems to be incorrect as it only sums up to 12 and prints the result, which is not what the problem requires. However, since the task is to test the correctness of the provided function `func_1`, we will write assertions for it.

Additionally, we will simulate the full program's behavior by writing a function that processes multiple test cases and compares the output with the expected results.

Here is the complete Python script with assertions:

```python
# Include necessary imports if any
# Assume the provided program is saved as 'program.py' and can be imported from the same dir.
from program import func_1

import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Test the function func_1
assert func_1(12) == 3  # 1 + 2 = 3
assert func_1(1) == 1   # 1 = 1
assert func_1(2) == 2   # 2 = 2
assert func_1(3) == 3   # 3 = 3
assert func_1(1434) == 12  # 1 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 12
assert func_1(2024) == 8  # 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 8
assert func_1(200000) == 2  # 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2

# Simulate the full program's behavior
def calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    return sum(func_1(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))

# Test the full program's behavior with multiple test cases
input_data = """7
12
1
2
3
1434
2024
200000"""
expected_output = """51
1
3
6
18465
28170
4600002"""

# Capture the output of the program with the given input
output = run_program_with_captured_io(input_data)

# Assert that the captured output matches the expected output
assert output == expected_output

# Additional test cases
assert calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(12) == 51
assert calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(1) == 1
assert calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(2) == 3
assert calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(3) == 6
assert calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(1434) == 18465
assert calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(2024) == 28170
assert calculate_sum_of_digit_sums(200000) == 4600002

# End of script
```

This script includes tests for the `func_1` function and simulates the full program's behavior to ensure correctness across various test cases.
