To create a comprehensive set of test cases for the provided program, we need to consider various scenarios based on the problem description. Since the program is written as a script that reads from standard input and writes to standard output, we'll use the `run_program_with_captured_io` function to execute the program and capture its output.

Here's the complete test script:

```python
import io
import sys

def run_program_with_captured_io(input_data):
    original_stdin = sys.stdin
    original_stdout = sys.stdout

    try:
        sys.stdin = io.StringIO(input_data)
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        with open("program.py", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            code = f.read()
            exec(code, {})

        return captured_output.getvalue().strip()
    
    finally:
        sys.stdin = original_stdin
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (
        "7\n4 4 5\n5 5 9\n10 10 5\n5 5 11\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n1000000000 1000000000 1\n1000 1 1000",
        "17\n35\n100\n45\n1000000000000000000\n1000000000000000000\n500500"
    ),
    (
        "1\n1 1 1",
        "1"
    ),
    (
        "1\n1 1 2",
        "2"
    ),
    (
        "1\n10 1 1",
        "10"
    ),
    (
        "1\n10 1 10",
        "55"
    ),
    (
        "1\n10 5 1",
        "50"
    ),
    (
        "1\n10 5 5",
        "50"
    ),
    (
        "1\n10 5 6",
        "54"
    ),
    (
        "1\n10 5 10",
        "70"
    ),
    (
        "1\n10 10 5",
        "100"
    ),
]

# Run test cases
for i, (input_data, expected_output) in enumerate(test_cases):
    assert run_program_with_captured_io(input_data) == expected_output, f"Test case {i+1} failed"

print("All test cases passed!")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Helper Function**: The `run_program_with_captured_io` function captures the output of the program when given specific input data.
2. **Test Cases**: A list of tuples where each tuple contains input data and the expected output.
3. **Assertions**: For each test case, the function is executed with the input data, and the output is compared against the expected output using an assertion.
4. **Edge Cases**: The test cases cover various scenarios including small numbers, large numbers, and edge conditions like `a == b`, `a > b`, and `a < b`.

This script ensures that the program behaves correctly for a variety of inputs.
