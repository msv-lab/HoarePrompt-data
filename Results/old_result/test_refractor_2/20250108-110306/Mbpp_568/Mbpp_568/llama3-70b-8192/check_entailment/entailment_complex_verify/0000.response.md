Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any non-negative integer `n`. The annotation states that the function initializes a list of length `n` where each element is an empty dictionary `{}`, and this list is then returned as the final state of the program. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
