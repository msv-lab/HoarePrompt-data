Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any positive integer `n`. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the list, which will contain `n` copies of the same empty dictionary. This meets the requirement of creating a list of `N` empty dictionaries for any `N`. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
