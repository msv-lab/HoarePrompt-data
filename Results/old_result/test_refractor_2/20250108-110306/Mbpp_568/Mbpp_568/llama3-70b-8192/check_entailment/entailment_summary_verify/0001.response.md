Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(n)` creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which exactly matches the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a non-negative integer `n` and returning a list of `n` empty dictionaries. Since there are no edge cases or special inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given problem description, and the provided code and output hints align with the requirements, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
