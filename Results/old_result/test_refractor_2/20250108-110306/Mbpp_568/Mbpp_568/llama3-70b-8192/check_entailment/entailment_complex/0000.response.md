Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries. The program uses a list comprehension to create a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which directly fulfills the requirement. Since the problem description specifies that the input `n` is a non-negative integer, and the program handles this correctly by generating the appropriate number of empty dictionaries, the program is correct for all valid inputs as per the given assumptions.
