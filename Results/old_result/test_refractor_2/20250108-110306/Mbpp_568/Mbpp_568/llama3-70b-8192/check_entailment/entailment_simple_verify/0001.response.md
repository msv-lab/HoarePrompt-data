Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning a list of `n` empty dictionaries when `n` is a non-negative integer. Since the problem description asks for a function that creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries and the function meets this requirement, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
