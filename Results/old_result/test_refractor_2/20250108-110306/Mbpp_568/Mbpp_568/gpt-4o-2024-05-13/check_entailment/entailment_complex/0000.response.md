Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. This is confirmed by the assertions at the beginning of the code, which check the function's output for different values of `N`. The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(N)]` correctly generates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, fulfilling the requirement for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
