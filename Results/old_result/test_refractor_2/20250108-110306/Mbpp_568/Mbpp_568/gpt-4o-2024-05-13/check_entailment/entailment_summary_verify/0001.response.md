Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. The code uses a list comprehension to generate the required list, which aligns with the problem description. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities. Since the function passes the given test cases and the output hints validate its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
