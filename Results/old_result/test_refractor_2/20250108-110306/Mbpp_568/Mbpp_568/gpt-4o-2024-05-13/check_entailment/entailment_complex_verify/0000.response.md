Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries as demonstrated by the assertions. The annotated version further clarifies that the function accepts a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotated version, and the function passes all provided test cases. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
