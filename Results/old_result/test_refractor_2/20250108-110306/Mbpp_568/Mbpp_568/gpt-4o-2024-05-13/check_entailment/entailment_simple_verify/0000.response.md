Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries. Each assertion tests the function with different values of `N`, and the function passes all these tests. The annotation clarifies that `N` is a non-negative integer before the function call, which is handled correctly by the function using list comprehension. There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
