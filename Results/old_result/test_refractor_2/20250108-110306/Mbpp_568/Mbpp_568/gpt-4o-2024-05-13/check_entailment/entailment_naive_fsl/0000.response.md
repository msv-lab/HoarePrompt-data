Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries for each of the test cases. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list containing `N` copies of the empty dictionary `{}`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for any positive integer value of `N`. Since the function passes the provided assertions and there are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
