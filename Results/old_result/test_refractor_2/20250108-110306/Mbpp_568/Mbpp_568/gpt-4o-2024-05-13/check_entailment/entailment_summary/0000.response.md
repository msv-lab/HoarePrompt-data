Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly generates a list of `N` empty dictionaries for the given test cases. The function uses a list comprehension to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which aligns with the problem description. Since the output hints confirm that the function works as expected and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the function should work correctly for any non-negative integer `N`. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
