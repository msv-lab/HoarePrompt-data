Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries as described in the problem statement. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which satisfies the requirement. The provided test cases with inputs 5, 6, and 7 all pass, and since the function behaves consistently and correctly for these cases, we can infer that it will work for any positive integer input `N`. There is no apparent edge case or potential issue that would cause the function to fail for other inputs.
