Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering all the given constraints:

1. **Exit Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the time needed to exit the current apartment if it is not on the first floor.
2. **Directional Walk Time**: It computes the time required to walk around the circular building to the correct apartment block using the minimum path (either clockwise or counterclockwise).
3. **Lift Time**: The time to use the lift to go from the current floor to the target floor is correctly calculated.
4. **Total Time Calculation**: The program sums up all these times to get the minimum time required.

Given the constraints and the provided examples, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There is no evident flaw or edge case that the program fails to address. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
