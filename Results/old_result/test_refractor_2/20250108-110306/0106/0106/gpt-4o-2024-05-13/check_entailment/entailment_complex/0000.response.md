Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when `floor_a` is 1 correctly in terms of the time to exit the current floor. According to the problem description and the intended behavior, if a person is already on the first floor, they should not spend any time exiting the floor. However, the code sets `time_to_exit` to 0 only if `floor_a` is exactly 1, but it should be 0 regardless of whether `floor_a` is 1 or any other value. The code incorrectly includes 9 seconds in `time_to_exit` even if `floor_a` is 1, which is not aligned with the problem description. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
