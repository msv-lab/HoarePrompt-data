Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further confirms that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads and validates the inputs according to the problem constraints.
2. **Location Calculation**: The `get_location` function accurately determines the block and floor for a given apartment number.
3. **Time Calculations**:
   - **Exit Time**: Correctly calculates the time to exit the current floor if not on the first floor.
   - **Walking Time**: Calculates the minimum time required to walk around the building to the target block, considering both direct and reverse directions.
   - **Lift Time**: Correctly calculates the time to use the lift to reach the target floor.
4. **Total Time Calculation**: Summarizes the time required for all components (exit, walking, lift, and target floor) to find the minimum time required to reach the destination.

The annotated version provides clear states at different points in the program, confirming that the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem requirements. There are no missing edge cases or flaws in the logic that would invalidate the programâ€™s correctness.
