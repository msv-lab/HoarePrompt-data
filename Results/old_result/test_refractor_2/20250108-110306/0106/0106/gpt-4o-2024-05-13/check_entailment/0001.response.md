Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment in all cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the scenario where Edvard needs to go up multiple floors using the elevator, which is a critical part of the problem description.

Consider the following case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`, `a = 4`, `b = 3`
- Expected output: 15 seconds (Edvard goes from the 2nd block, 2nd floor, apartment 4 to the 1st block, 2nd floor, apartment 3).

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the time:
- It correctly identifies that Edvard is in the 2nd block, 2nd floor.
- It correctly identifies that Natasha is in the 1st block, 2nd floor.
- However, it only considers the shortest path around the building, which is 15 seconds, without accounting for the elevator ride to go down one floor (which would take 10 + 1 = 11 seconds).

The program should consider the elevator option and choose the minimum time between walking and using the elevator. Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly.
