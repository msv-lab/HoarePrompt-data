Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment in all cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the scenario where Edvard needs to use the elevator to go up or down multiple floors, which is a critical part of the problem description. The output hints for `get_location` are correct and cover the necessary calculations for determining the block and floor numbers, but they do not address the core issue in `func_1` regarding the elevator usage and the overall minimum time calculation. Therefore, the program still does not handle all cases correctly as per the problem description.
