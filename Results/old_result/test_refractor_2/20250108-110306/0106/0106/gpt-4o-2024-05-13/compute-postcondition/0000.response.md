The code calculates the `block` number based on the given formula. Let's break it down:

1. The formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is used to determine the block number.
2. `block` is assigned the result of this calculation.
3. The `apartment` number, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Let's represent the calculation more clearly:
- First, `apartment - 1` gives the apartment number minus one.
- Then, `(apartment - 1) // (m * k)` performs integer division, which gives the quotient of dividing the adjusted apartment number by the total number of apartments per block.
- Adding `1` to the result adjusts for zero-based indexing, making the first block start at 1 instead of 0.

Given that `m` and `k` are positive integers, the value of `block` will be calculated accordingly. The initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are preserved, but `block` is updated based on these values.

Output State: **`apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of floors in each block, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of apartments on each floor, and `block` is the calculated block number based on the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
