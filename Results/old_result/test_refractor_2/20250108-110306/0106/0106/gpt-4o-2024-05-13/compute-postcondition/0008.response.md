The code calculates `reverse_walk_time` based on the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

1. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
2. This calculation does not affect `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, or `direct_walk_time`. It only introduces a new variable `reverse_walk_time`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, except for the introduction of the new variable `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n*m*k\) and \(a \neq b\); `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are the return values of the functions `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` respectively; if `floor_a == 1`, `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is `9 + floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
