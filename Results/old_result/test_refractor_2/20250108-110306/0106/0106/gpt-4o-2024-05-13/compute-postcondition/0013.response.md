The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. All of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b.

Case_1: The function returns `total_time`, which is calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit` (either 0 or 9 + floor_a), `min_walk_time` (the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`), and `time_to_target_floor` ((floor_b - 1) * 5).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept five parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) and return the calculated `total_time` based on the given formulas.
