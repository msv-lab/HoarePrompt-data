The code calculates the `floor_within_block` based on the formula `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. This operation does not affect the values of `apartment`, `m`, `k`, or `block`. The calculation updates the value of `floor_within_block`.

Let's break it down:

1. The value of `apartment` remains unchanged.
2. The value of `m` remains unchanged.
3. The value of `k` remains unchanged.
4. The value of `block` remains unchanged.
5. `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.

Therefore, the output state is: `apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of floors in each block, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of apartments on each floor, `block` is the calculated block number based on the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.

Output State: **`apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of floors in each block, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of apartments on each floor, `block` is the calculated block number based on the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`**.
