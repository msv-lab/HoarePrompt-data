Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n*m*k and a ≠ b. It calculates and returns the total time required for two people to meet at the same floor in an elevator system.

After the function concludes, the following will be true:
1. The total time is the sum of three components:
   - `time_to_exit`: This is either 0 if the person starting from floor 1 exits immediately, or 9 + floor_a if they start from a higher floor.
   - `min_walk_time`: This is the minimum of the time taken to walk directly between blocks (calculated as the absolute difference in blocks modulo n times 15) or walking the long way around the building (calculated as the complement of the direct distance modulo n times 15).
   - `time_to_target_floor`: This is the time to walk down to the target floor, calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `floor_a` is 1, the `time_to_exit` is correctly set to 0.
- If `floor_a` is greater than 1, the `time_to_exit` is correctly set to 9 + floor_a.
- The `min_walk_time` calculation considers both direct and reverse walking scenarios and chooses the minimum.
- The `time_to_target_floor` is correctly calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5, representing the time to reach the target floor from the ground floor (assuming the target floor is not the ground floor).

All potential cases and calculations are correctly covered by the code, and no additional functionality is missing.**
