The code `time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5` assigns the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5` to `time_to_target_floor`. This does not affect any other variables.

Given the initial state, the output state includes the updated value of `time_to_target_floor`.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15` and `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n*m*k\) and \(a \neq b\); `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are the return values of the functions `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` respectively; if `floor_a == 1`, `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is `9 + floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`; `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
