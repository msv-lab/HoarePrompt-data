#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    block_a, floor_a = get_location(a)
    block_b, floor_b = get_location(b)
    if (floor_a == 1) :
        time_to_exit = 0
    else :
        time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n*m*k\) and \(a \neq b\); `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are the return values of the functions `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` respectively; if `floor_a == 1`, `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is `9 + floor_a`.
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
    min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
    time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time
    #The program returns total_time which is the sum of time_to_exit (either 0 or 9 + floor_a), min_walk_time (the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time), and time_to_target_floor ((floor_b - 1) * 5)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n*m*k and a ≠ b. It calculates and returns the total time required for two people to meet at the same floor in an elevator system.

After the function concludes, the following will be true:
1. The total time is the sum of three components:
   - `time_to_exit`: This is either 0 if the person starting from floor 1 exits immediately, or 9 + floor_a if they start from a higher floor.
   - `min_walk_time`: This is the minimum of the time taken to walk directly between blocks (calculated as the absolute difference in blocks modulo n times 15) or walking the long way around the building (calculated as the complement of the direct distance modulo n times 15).
   - `time_to_target_floor`: This is the time to walk down to the target floor, calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `floor_a` is 1, the `time_to_exit` is correctly set to 0.
- If `floor_a` is greater than 1, the `time_to_exit` is correctly set to 9 + floor_a.
- The `min_walk_time` calculation considers both direct and reverse walking scenarios and chooses the minimum.
- The `time_to_target_floor` is correctly calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5, representing the time to reach the target floor from the ground floor (assuming the target floor is not the ground floor).

All potential cases and calculations are correctly covered by the code, and no additional functionality is missing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: apartment is an integer representing the apartment number, and m and k are positive integers representing the number of floors in each block and the number of apartments on each floor, respectively.
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #`block` is the calculated block number based on the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k); `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`, and the program returns `block` and `floor`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` which represents the apartment number and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers. The block number is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `m` is the number of floors in each block and `k` is the number of apartments on each floor. The floor number within the block is determined by `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, and the final floor number is given by `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The function covers the case when `apartment` is a valid positive integer and handles edge cases such as when `apartment` is 1, which would result in `block` being 1 and `floor` being 1. If `apartment` exceeds the total number of apartments available (`m * k`), the function still correctly calculates the block and floor based on the provided formulas.
