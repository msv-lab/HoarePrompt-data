The code assigns `min_block_time` with the minimum value between `abs(a_block - b_block)` and `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` multiplied by 15. 

- `a_block` and `b_block` are already calculated and do not change.
- `n` remains unchanged.

We need to calculate the value of `min_block_time`:

1. Calculate `abs(a_block - b_block)`: This represents the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`.
2. Calculate `n - abs(a_block - b_block)`: This represents the remaining time after accounting for the direct difference between `a_block` and `b_block`.

The final value of `min_block_time` will be the minimum of these two values, multiplied by 15.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` = (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` = (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15**
