The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the constraints but are not listed in the function definition. Based on the constraints, the function should work with these parameters, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range 1 to \(n \cdot m \cdot k\) with the condition that `a ≠ b`.

Given the lack of specific information about the return value in the provided output, we cannot determine what the function returns without additional details.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, where n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b, but does not specify the return value.**
