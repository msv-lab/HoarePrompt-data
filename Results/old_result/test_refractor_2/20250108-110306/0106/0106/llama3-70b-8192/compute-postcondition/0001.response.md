`a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are no longer directly specified in terms of their original values because they are replaced by the input values. However, the conditions that `a` and `b` must satisfy (1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k, and a ≠ b) still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer and a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k**
