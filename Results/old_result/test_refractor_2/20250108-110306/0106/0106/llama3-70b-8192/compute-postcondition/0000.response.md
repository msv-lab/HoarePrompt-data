`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means each of these variables now holds a specific integer value input by the user, while `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
