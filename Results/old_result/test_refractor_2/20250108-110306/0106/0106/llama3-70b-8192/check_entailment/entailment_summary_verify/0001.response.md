Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the revised program now correctly handles the scenario where both the starting and ending floors are the same but the blocks are different. The original assessment was incorrect because it did not account for the fact that the provided code has been revised to handle these edge cases appropriately.

Here are the key points that support the correctness of the program:
1. The program correctly calculates the floor and block positions for both `a` and `b`.
2. It properly accounts for the different scenarios (same block, different blocks, etc.) and calculates the minimum time required to move between them.
3. The inclusion of the lift travel time ensures that the overall calculation of the minimum time is accurate.
4. The output hints and the problem description align with the implemented logic in the program.

Therefore, the program now meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints, making the final assessment **True**.
