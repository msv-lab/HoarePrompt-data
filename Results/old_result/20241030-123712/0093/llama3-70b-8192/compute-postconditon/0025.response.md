`puzzle2` is assigned a list containing the concatenation of two input strings. The initial state of `puzzle1` is unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `puzzle1` is a list containing the concatenation of two input strings, `puzzle2` is a list containing the concatenation of two input strings.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a list containing the concatenation of two input strings, `puzzle2` is a list containing the concatenation of two input strings**
