`power_of_two[i]` is assigned the value of `power_of_two[i - 1] * 2 % MOD`. Given that `i` is 2, `power_of_two[1]` is 2 (as per the initial state), and `MOD` is 998244353, we can calculate `power_of_two[2]` as follows:
`power_of_two[2] = 2 * 2 % 998244353 = 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0, `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, and the third element is 4, `i` is 2**.
