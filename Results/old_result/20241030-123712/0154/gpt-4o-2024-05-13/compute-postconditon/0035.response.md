dp[i] is assigned the value dp[half] * dp[half] * 2 % MOD. Given that half is 2, dp[2] is either 2 or 4. Therefore, dp[5] is assigned the value (2 * 2 * 2 % 998244353) = 8 or (4 * 4 * 2 % 998244353) = 32. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1, the third element as 2 or 4 (depending on the condition), if `(i - 1) % 2 == 0` then `dp[4]` is set to `dp[1] * dp[1] * 2 % 998244353 = 2`, otherwise `dp[4]` is set to `dp[1] * dp[2] * 2 % 998244353 = 4`, `dp[5]` is either 8 or 32, `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where `power_of_two[i]` is equal to `2^i % MOD` for all `0 <= i <= n`, `i` is 5, `half` is 2**
