Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^6. If `n` equals 1, it returns 1. If `n` equals 2, it returns 0. For `n` >= 3, it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate and return `dp[n]` with a modulus of 998244353, where `dp` is a list of precomputed values based on certain conditions. However, if `n` is less than 1 or greater than 10^6, the behavior is undefined as there is no error handling for these cases. Additionally, if the list `dp` is not properly initialized or if there is any memory issue due to the large size of `n`, the function may not work correctly.**
