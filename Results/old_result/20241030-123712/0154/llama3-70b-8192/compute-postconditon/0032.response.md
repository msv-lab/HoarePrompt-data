According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than 0.

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is specifically less than 0, instead of less than or equal to 1. All other state variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[2]` is `dp[2] % 998244353`, the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] % 998244353`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1] * ((i - 1) // j % 2)`, `dp[2]` is `dp[2] % 998244353**
