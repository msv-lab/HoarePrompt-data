According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length `n + 1`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6. For the loop to execute again, `i` being 4 means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since `i` < `n + 1` implies `4 < n + 1` which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 4, `j` is 3**
