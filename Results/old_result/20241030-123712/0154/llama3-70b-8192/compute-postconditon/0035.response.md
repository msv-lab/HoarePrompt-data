According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\). Given the range of `n`, it is guaranteed that \( n + 1 \) will always be greater than or equal to 4, which means the loop can certainly execute one more time since \( i = 3 \) and \( i < n + 1 \).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2**
