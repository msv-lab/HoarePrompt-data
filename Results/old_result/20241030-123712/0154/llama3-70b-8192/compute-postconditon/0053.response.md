`dp[n]` is returned. If `n >= 1`, `dp[n]` is `0` since `dp[0]` is `1` and the rest are `0`s. If `n` is `0` or negative, `dp[0]` is `1`. Therefore, the function returns `dp[n]`.

Output State: **If `n >= 1`, `dp` remains a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` will be `n + 1`, and the function returns 0. If `n` is 0, the list `dp` remains unchanged and the function returns 1. If `n` is negative, the list `dp` remains unchanged and the function returns `dp[n]`.**
