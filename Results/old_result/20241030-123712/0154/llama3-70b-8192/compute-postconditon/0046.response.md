`dp[i]` is assigned the value `dp[i] % MOD`. Given `i` is 3, this means `dp[3]` is updated to `dp[3] % 998244353`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] % 998244353`, `i` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to 0**
