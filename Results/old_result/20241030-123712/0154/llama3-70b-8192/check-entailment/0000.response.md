Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of counting perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with `n` vertices and distinct integer keys between `1` and `n`, inclusive. Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Loop Condition**: The inner loop condition `((i - 1) // j % 2)` is incorrect because it does not correctly check the parity conditions described in the problem statement. It should check the parities of nodes in the left and right subtrees to ensure they follow the striped condition.

2. **Dynamic Programming State Transition**: The state transition logic used in the dynamic programming approach is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the number of balanced striped binary search trees with `i` nodes.

3. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized correctly, but the recurrence relation used to fill it up is incorrect for the given problem statement.

4. **Index Handling**: The code does not handle the case for `n = 0` gracefully, although it is specified in the problem that `n` will be at least `1`.

For example, given `n = 3`, the code should return `0` because there are no perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with 3 vertices, but the current logic does not guarantee that.

Here's a corrected approach outline:
- Ensure that the parity conditions are checked correctly for left and right subtrees.
- Use a correct dynamic programming state transition that considers the balanced tree condition and parity condition.

Without a correct logic implementation, the current code is incorrect for the given problem description.
