You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with a function description and a Python function code snippet. You need to provide if the code does what the function description says. Please avoid describing how the program runs. If the code satisfies the description reply CORRECT, otherwise reply INCORRECT with an explanation. You must adhere to the text format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.

Description: Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $1$ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...

Your task is to print the $k$-th digit of this sequence.


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) â€” the position to process ($1$-based index).


-----Output-----

Print the $k$-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
7

Input
21

Output
5
Python Fucntion:
```
k = int(input())

# Step 1: Determine the length of the number where the k-th digit lies
length = 1
count = 9
start = 1

while k > length * count:
    k -= length * count
    length += 1
    count *= 10
    start *= 10

# Step 2: Determine the exact number and digit within that number
number = start + (k - 1) // length
digit_index = (k - 1) % length

# Step 3: Convert the number to string and get the digit
result = str(number)[digit_index]

print(result)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Use the format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.
