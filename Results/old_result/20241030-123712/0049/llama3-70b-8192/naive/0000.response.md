RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The code snippet attempts to find the \(k\)-th digit in the infinite sequence by converting each integer to a string and checking the length of the string. However, this approach is inefficient and will not work for large values of \(k\) (up to \(10^{12}\)). The code does not handle large \(k\) efficiently and will take an impractically long time to find the result. Additionally, it doesn't correctly update \(k\) and \(n\) to ensure the accurate \(k\)-th position in the infinite sequence.
