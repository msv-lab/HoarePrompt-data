`k` is decremented by the total length of string representations of numbers from 1 to n, `n` is the smallest integer such that the combined lengths of the numbers from 1 to `n` contain at least the original input integer `k` characters, `s` is the string representation of `n` when the loop terminates. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop terminates immediately, attempting to print `s[k - 1]` which might result in unexpected behavior.
