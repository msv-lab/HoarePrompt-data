`distinct_chars` is assigned the value `set(s)`, which is a set of the distinct characters in the input string `s`. The value of `s` is not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string, `distinct_chars` is a set of the distinct characters in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is an input string, `distinct_chars` is a set of the distinct characters in `s`**
