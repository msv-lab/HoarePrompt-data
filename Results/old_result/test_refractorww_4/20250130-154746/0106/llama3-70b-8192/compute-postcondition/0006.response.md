Output State: **`min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**

In natural language: The value of `min_block_time` is computed as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, and the difference between `n` and that same absolute difference also multiplied by 15. The values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` remain unchanged from their initial states.
