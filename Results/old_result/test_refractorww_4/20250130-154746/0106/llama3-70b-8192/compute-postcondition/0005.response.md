Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1` to the variable `b_block`. No other variables are affected, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
