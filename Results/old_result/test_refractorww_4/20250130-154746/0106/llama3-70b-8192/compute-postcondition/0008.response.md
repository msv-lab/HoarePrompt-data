Postcondition: **`min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and the current value of `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.**
