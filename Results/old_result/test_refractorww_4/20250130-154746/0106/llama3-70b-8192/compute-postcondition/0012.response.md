Output State: **`min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_floor_time` is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` and `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `min_floor_time` based on the difference between `b_floor` and `a_floor`, multiplied by 5 and then adding 10. Since `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, the value of `min_floor_time` is determined, but the expressions for `min_block_time`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` remain unchanged from the initial state.
