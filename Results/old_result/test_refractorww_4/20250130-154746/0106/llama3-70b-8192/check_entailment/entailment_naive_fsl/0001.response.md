Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, the calculation of `min_block_time` does not account for the time taken to go from the current block to the target block considering the circular nature of the building. Additionally, the calculation of `min_floor_time` does not consider the scenario where Edvard needs to move between floors after reaching the target block.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
4 10 5
200 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
39
```

**Actual Output:**
The program would incorrectly calculate the time, as it does not properly handle the circular movement between blocks.

The program should take into account the optimal path considering both direct block transitions and floor transitions. A more comprehensive approach would be required to handle all possible scenarios accurately.
