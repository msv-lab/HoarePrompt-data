Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum time required for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) and two integers \( a \) and \( b \) from standard input. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the floor and block indices for both \( a \) and \( b \):
   - `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated using modular arithmetic to determine the floor number.
   - `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated by integer division to determine the block number.

3. **Minimum Time Between Blocks**: The program calculates the minimum time to move between the blocks containing \( a \) and \( b \). This is done by considering the circular nature of the building:
   - `min_block_time` is calculated as \( \min(|a\_block - b\_block|, n - |a\_block - b\_block|) \times 15 \).

4. **Minimum Time Within the Same Block**: The program calculates the minimum time to move between the floors within the same block:
   - `min_floor_time` is calculated based on whether `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor` or not, adding a fixed delay of 10 units if the move crosses a boundary.

5. **Total Minimum Time**: The program correctly sums up the minimum block and floor times to get the total minimum time.

The program does not include explicit error handling for invalid inputs, but it implicitly handles valid inputs through the constraints provided in the problem statement. The logic appears to be sound and aligns with the requirements stated in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
