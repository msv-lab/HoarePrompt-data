Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly calculates the minimum time required for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. The code accurately handles the block and floor calculations, considers the shortest path between blocks, and accounts for the time taken to use the elevator and move between floors. The output hints confirm that the program logic aligns with the problem requirements. The original assessment correctly identified the key aspects of the program's functionality and logic, and there are no significant issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle based on the given constraints and assumptions.
