Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input split and converted to integers, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The constraints for `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b) are preserved.
