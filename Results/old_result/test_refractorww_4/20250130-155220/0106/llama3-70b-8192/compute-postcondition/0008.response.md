Output State: **`a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is ((a - 1) // (m * k)) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input split and converted to integers, `a` and `b` are integers from input with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b, and `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10.**

This output state describes that the values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and the condition `a_floor > b_floor` remain unchanged. Additionally, `min_floor_time` is now set to the expression `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.
