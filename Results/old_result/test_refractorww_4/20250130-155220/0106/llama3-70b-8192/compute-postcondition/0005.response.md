Output State: **`a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is ((a - 1) // (m * k)) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input split and converted to integers, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `b_block` based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. This does not affect the values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The initial values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, and `b_floor` remain unchanged, and the new value of `b_block` is calculated based on the given formula.
