Output State: **`a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is ((a - 1) // (m * k)) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input split and converted to integers, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**

In this output state, the code has calculated the floor number (`b_floor`) for the integer `b` using the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `a_floor` and `a_block` remain unchanged as they were calculated before the code was run. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are still the same as those input and converted to integers. Similarly, `a` and `b` are still integers as input with the constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.
