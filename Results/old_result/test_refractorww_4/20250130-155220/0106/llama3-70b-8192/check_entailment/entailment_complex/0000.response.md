Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from standard input. This part is handled correctly by using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the floor (`a_floor`, `b_floor`) and block (`a_block`, `b_block`) numbers for both `a` and `b`. These calculations are:
   - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1`
   - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
   - Similarly for `b_floor` and `b_block`.

3. **Minimum Block Time Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum time to move between the blocks containing `a` and `b`. This is done by calculating the absolute difference between the block numbers and considering the circular nature of the building.

4. **Minimum Floor Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the minimum time to move between the floors within the same block. This is done based on whether `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor` or vice versa.

5. **Output**: The program prints the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time, which gives the total minimum time required for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment.

Given the logical correctness of the program and its adherence to the problem statement, the annotated program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
