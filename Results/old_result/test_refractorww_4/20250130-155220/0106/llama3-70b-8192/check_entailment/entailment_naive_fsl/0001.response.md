Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the optimal path involves using the lift within the same block. Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4 10 5
  200 198
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Edvard is on the 10th floor of the 4th block, and Natasha is on the 1st floor of the 4th block.
  - The optimal path would involve:
    1. Taking the lift from the 10th floor to the 1st floor (10 seconds).
    2. Walking to the 4th block (15 seconds).
    3. Taking the lift from the 1st floor to the 1st floor again (0 seconds since he is already there).

  - Total time: \(10 + 15 = 25\) seconds.

However, the provided program calculates the minimum time as follows:
- It calculates the minimum block time as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, which is correct.
- It then calculates the minimum floor time as `min((a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10, (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10)`, which does not account for the possibility of using the lift within the same block.

In the example above, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum floor time as:
- \((200 - 198) * 5 + 10 = 20\) seconds.

This results in an incorrect output of 35 seconds instead of the expected 25 seconds. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
