Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where the target apartment is in a different block but on the same floor as the starting apartment. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Calculation of Block and Floor Positions:**
   - The code correctly computes the block and floor positions for both apartments.
   - However, it does not consider the possibility where the target apartment is in the same block but on a different floor.

2. **Time Calculation Logic:**
   - The code correctly calculates the time required to travel between blocks using the elevator and walking.
   - It also correctly calculates the time required to travel between floors using the stairs.
   - However, it does not handle the scenario where the target apartment is on the same floor but in a different block. In such cases, the current implementation will always assume the worst-case scenario of traveling through the entire building, which is incorrect.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
200 205
```
- Apartment 200 is in the 4th block, 4th floor.
- Apartment 205 is in the 4th block, 5th floor.

According to the problem description, the optimal path would be to:
1. Take the elevator to the 5th floor in the 4th block (1 second).
2. Walk to the 5th floor in the 4th block (5 seconds).

However, the current code will incorrectly calculate the time as traveling through the entire building:
1. Travel to the 1st block (15 seconds).
2. Take the elevator to the 5th floor in the 1st block (10 seconds).
3. Walk to the 5th floor in the 1st block (5 seconds).
4. Walk to the 5th floor in the 4th block (15 seconds).

This results in a total time of 45 seconds instead of 11 seconds.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is **Incorrect**.
