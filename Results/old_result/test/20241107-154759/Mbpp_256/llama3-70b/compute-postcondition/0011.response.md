According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num` (rounded up). At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after incrementing by 1.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next value after incrementing by 1**
