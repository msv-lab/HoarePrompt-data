Functionality: The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and determines if it is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is 2 or greater, it iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The function always returns True if `num` is not less than 2 and is not divisible by any number in the specified range.
