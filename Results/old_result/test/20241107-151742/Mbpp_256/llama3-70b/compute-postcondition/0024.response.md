Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 3, so after execution, `count` becomes 4. The values of `num` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 4, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
Output State: **`count` is 4, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
