Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 3. The values of `num` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 3, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
Output State: **`count` is 3, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
