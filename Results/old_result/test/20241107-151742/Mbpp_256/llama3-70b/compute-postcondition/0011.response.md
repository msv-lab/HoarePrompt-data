According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the specified range. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 4. If `num` is divisible by 4, the loop will exit. Since `i` is 4 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 5**
