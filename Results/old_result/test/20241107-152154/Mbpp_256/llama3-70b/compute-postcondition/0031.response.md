The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the constraints that `n` is a non-negative integer. There are four possible cases of output, each denoted by a letter `C`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to not accept any parameters and to return one of the possible outputs denoted by `C` based on the non-negative integer `n`.
