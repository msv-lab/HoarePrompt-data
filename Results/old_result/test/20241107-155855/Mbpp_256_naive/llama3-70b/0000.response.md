Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a nested function `is_prime(num)` that correctly identifies if a given number is prime or not.
2. The main function `func_1(n)` correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`.
3. The program iterates through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and counts the prime numbers, which is the correct approach to finding the number of prime numbers less than the given number.
4. The logic for checking if a number is prime is also correct, as it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, which is an optimized approach for prime checking.
