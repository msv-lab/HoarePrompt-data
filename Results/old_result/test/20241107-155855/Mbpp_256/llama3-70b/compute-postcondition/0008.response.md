According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num` and `i`. If `num` is not divisible by `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must not be divisible by 4. Therefore, the state of the program variables needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4**
