The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If n is greater than or equal to 2, the function iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1. For each prime number encountered within this range, count is incremented by 1. After the loop finishes, count will contain the number of prime numbers between 2 and n (exclusive), and the function returns this count. The code does not explicitly check for the primality of numbers, so the functionality may be inaccurate if the `is_prime` function does not correctly identify prime numbers.
