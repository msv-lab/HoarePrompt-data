Functionality: The function `is_prime` takes a non-negative integer `num` as input. It then determines whether `num` is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function iterates through a loop to check if `num` is divisible by any number in the range [2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1). If `num` is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number. If the code does not align with the annotations, the function may miss some edge cases or behave differently than described.
