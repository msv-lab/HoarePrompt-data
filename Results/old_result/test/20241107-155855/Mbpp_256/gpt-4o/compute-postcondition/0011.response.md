According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `j` is less than `n` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is set to False.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variable `j`. Since `j` is currently less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is set to False, the next iteration will depend on the value of `j` after the increment operation `j += i`. 

After the increment operation, `j` will be `i * i + i`, so we need to update the value of `j` accordingly. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is `i * i + i` and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
