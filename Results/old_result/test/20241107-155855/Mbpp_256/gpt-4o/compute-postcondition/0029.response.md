According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than the square root of `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, and `j` is `i * i + i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4 and `j` needs to be adjusted to `i * i + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 4, `j` is `i * i + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
