According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be less than `n` again. In this case, `j` is equal to `i * i`, so it needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` on the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
