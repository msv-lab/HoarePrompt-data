Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False. For each iteration of the loop, starting from `i=2`, if `is_prime[i]` is True, all multiples of `i` up to `n` have their corresponding `is_prime` values set to False. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute. If `n` is less than `i * i`, the loop does not execute.**
