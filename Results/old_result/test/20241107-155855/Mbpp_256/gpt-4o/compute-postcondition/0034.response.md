According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than the square root of `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` increments by 1 after each iteration, `j` is `i * i + (k * i)` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False for all valid `j` values. Since the loop is executing for the first time, there is no need to adjust any other states.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
