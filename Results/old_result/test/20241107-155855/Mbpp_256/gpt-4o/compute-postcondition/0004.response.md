According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 2. Before the loop starts, the list `is_prime` needs to be adjusted so that all elements are set to True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are set to False. Also, `i` should be set to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2**
