According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently set as `i * i`, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n`**
