Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find the prime numbers. The provided test cases (5, 10, 100) all return the expected results. Additionally, the program handles the case where the input number is less than or equal to 2 by returning 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 2. Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and passes the given test cases.
