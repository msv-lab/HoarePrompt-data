According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range specified by `range(i * i, n, i)` has more elements to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. To execute the loop one more time, the condition `j in range(i * i, n, i)` needs to be satisfied. Since `j` is equal to `i * i`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy this condition and adjust `j` accordingly.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
