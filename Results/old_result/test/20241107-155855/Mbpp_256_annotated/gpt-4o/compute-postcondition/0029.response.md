According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` has some elements set to `False`, `j` is 20. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 20 and is incremented by `i` each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `20 + 4 = 24`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`, so `j` should be less than `n` which is 16. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `is_prime` has some elements set to `False`, `j` is 16**
