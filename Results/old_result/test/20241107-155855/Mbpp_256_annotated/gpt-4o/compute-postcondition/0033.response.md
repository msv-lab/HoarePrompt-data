Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is updated with some elements set to `False`. If `n` is less than `i * i`, `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is equal to or greater than `i * i`, `is_prime` will have some elements set to `False` based on the loop iterations over the range from `i * i` to `n` with step size `i`.***
