According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the elements in the `is_prime` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements, `j` is 12, `is_prime[j]` is `False`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted such that it is within the range of `i * i` and `n` and `is_prime[j]` needs to be `True`. Additionally, `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop condition is satisfied.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements, `j` is adjusted to a value within the range of `i * i` and `n` and `is_prime[j]` is `True`**
