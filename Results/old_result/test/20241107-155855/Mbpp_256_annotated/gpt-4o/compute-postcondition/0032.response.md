Output State: 

The loop updates the elements in the `is_prime` list to `False` starting from `i * i` and incrementing by `i` until reaching `n`. If `n` is less than `i * i`, the loop won't execute. After the loop executes, `is_prime` will have some elements set to `False` based on the values of `j` calculated during the iterations. 
If `n` is less than `i * i`, `is_prime` remains unchanged. 
If `n` is equal to or greater than `i * i`, the elements in `is_prime` will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **If n is less than i * i, is_prime remains unchanged. If n is equal to or greater than i * i, is_prime will have some elements set to False based on the loop iterations.**
