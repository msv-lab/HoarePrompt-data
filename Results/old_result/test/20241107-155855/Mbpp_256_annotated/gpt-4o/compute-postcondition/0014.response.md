According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` and greater than 2. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`**
