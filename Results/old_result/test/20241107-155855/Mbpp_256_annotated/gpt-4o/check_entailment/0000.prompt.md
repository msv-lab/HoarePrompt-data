You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 0
        #State of the program after the return statement: n is a non-negative integer and the function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: n is a non-negative integer and the function returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.
    is_prime = [True] * n
    #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to `True`
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    #State of the program here: `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #
    #If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains the same. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, after the loop executes, `is_prime` will have elements updated to `False` for all multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `is_prime` will have updated elements based on the loop iterations.
    return sum(is_prime)
    #State of the program after the return statement: `n` is an integer, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values with elements updated based on prime number multiples, and the function returns the sum of the updated `is_prime` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function updates the `is_prime` list based on prime number multiples and returns the sum of the updated `is_prime` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, and if `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it updates the `is_prime` list and returns the sum of the updated list.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
