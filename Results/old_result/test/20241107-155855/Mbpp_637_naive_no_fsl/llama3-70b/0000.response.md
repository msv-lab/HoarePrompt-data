Correctness: True

Explanation: The given function simply checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. If the cost price is equal to the selling price, then it means there is no profit or loss incurred. This condition satisfies the problem description for all potential cases, hence the program is correct.
