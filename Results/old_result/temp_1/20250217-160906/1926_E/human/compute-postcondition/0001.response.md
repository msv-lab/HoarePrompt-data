Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The key variables involved here are `_` (which is a dummy variable used as a placeholder) and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The loop will iterate `t` times.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is a valid positive integer. The initial state of `t` being an input integer between 1 and 5 ⋅ 10^4 means we need to ensure `t` is within this range and is greater than 0.

Given the constraints and the requirement, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `t` must be an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4 and must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4 and must be greater than 0**
