Output State: `t` test cases are processed, and for each test case, the result is printed based on the given formula. The final state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `n_back`, `s`, `m`, and `n` after all iterations will depend on the input values for each test case, but the output will be a series of integers generated from the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`.
