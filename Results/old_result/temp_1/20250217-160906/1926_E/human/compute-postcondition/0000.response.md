Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4`, this condition remains valid after the input operation. All other variables remain unchanged, so they retain their unspecified initial states.
