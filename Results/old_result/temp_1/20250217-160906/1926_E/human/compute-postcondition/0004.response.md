Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes test cases where each test case includes three values: t (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4), n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and k.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and expected input structure are detailed.
