Functionality: **The function processes up to 50,000 test cases, where each test case consists of three integers: `n`, `k`, and an implicit `t`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of integers corresponding to the calculated results for each test case.**
