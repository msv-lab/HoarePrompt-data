Output State: `t` is an input integer, and for each test case, the output is calculated based on the formula \((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m\) after the specified operations inside the loop. The value of `n_back`, `s`, `n`, `m`, and the final output for each test case depend on the initial values of `n` and `k` for that test case.
