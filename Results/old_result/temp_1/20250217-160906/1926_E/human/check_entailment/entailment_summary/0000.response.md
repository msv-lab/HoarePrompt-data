Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the sequence generation according to the multipliers (1, 2, 3, ...). The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Card Sequence**: The code attempts to calculate the position of the k-th card using a formula that does not correctly represent the sequence generation process described. It does not iterate through each multiplier step-by-step and lay out the cards accordingly.

2. **Simplified Approach**: The code uses a simplified approach that does not account for the different multipliers (1, 2, 3, ...) and their respective card positions. It instead tries to directly compute the k-th card position without simulating the entire sequence.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example from the problem description:

- For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the expected output is `7`, as per the sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
- However, the provided code does not generate this sequence correctly and may produce incorrect results.

A correct implementation would involve simulating the sequence generation step-by-step, iterating through each multiplier and laying out the appropriate cards in the specified order. This requires a more detailed and structured approach to handle each case accurately.
