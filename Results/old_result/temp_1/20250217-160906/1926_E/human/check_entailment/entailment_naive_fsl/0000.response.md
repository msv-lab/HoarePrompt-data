Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. The logic involves iterating through different multiples of odd numbers and laying down cards accordingly. However, the current implementation does not handle the process of laying down cards in the correct sequence as described in the problem statement.

To fix this, we need to iterate over the odd numbers and their multiples, keeping track of how many cards have been laid down and stopping when we reach the k-th card. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        card_number = 1
        i = 1
        while True:
            for j in range(1, n + 1, 2):  # Iterate over odd numbers
                for multiple in range(i):
                    if count == k:
                        print(card_number)
                        break
                    count += 1
                    card_number = j * i
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                i += 1
                continue
            break

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we correctly lay down the cards in the specified order and find the k-th card as required.
