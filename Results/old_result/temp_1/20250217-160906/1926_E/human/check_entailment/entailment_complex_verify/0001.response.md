Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` (number of test cases) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` as positive integers, ensuring they are within the specified ranges.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - `n_back` is set to the original value of `n`.
   - `s` is calculated as the number of odd-numbered cards (`(n + 1) // 2`).
   - `n` is updated to half of `s`, representing the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - `m` is initialized to `1`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs until `s` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `n` becomes zero, it resets `s` to `n_back` and updates `n` to `1` to start the next multiple.
     - `m` is doubled, representing the next multiple.
     - `n` is halved, updating the count of remaining cards for the next multiple.
     - `s` is incremented by `n`, updating the cumulative count of cards laid down.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - After exiting the loop, the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` is used to compute the `k-th` card.
   - This formula correctly maps the position `k` to the appropriate card based on the laid-down sequence.

5. **Examples**:
   - The provided examples in the annotated code and the problem description confirm that the program correctly identifies the `k-th` card in the sequence.

Given that the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the logic of the program accurately implements the required sequence, the original assessment is correct. Therefore, the final assessment remains:

Final: **True**
