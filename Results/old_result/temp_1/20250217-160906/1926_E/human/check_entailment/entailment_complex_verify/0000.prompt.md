You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .
Program:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        n_back = n
        s = (n + 1) // 2
        n = (n + 1) // 2
        m = 1
        while s < k:
            if n == 0:
                s = n_back
                n = 1
                break
            m *= 2
            n //= 2
            s += n
        print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process for laying down the cards. Specifically, the program fails to handle the correct sequence of multiples of odd numbers as per the problem description.

For instance, consider the test case \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 14 \):

- According to the problem description, the order of laying down cards should be:
  1. All odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  2. Cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6
  3. Cards that are three times an odd number: 6 (not 9, since 9 > 7)
  4. Cards that are four times an odd number: 12 (not 12, since 12 > 7)

However, the program's logic does not accurately capture these steps. It calculates the cumulative count of laid down cards but does not properly distribute them into the correct categories. This leads to incorrect results for certain values of \( k \).

For example, in the given test case, the program will not produce the correct 14th card laid down, which should be 27 based on the description but the program outputs an incorrect value.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        n_back = n
        
        s = (n + 1) // 2
        
        n = (n + 1) // 2
        
        m = 1
        
        while s < k:
            if n == 0:
                s = n_back
                n = 1
                break
            m *= 2
            n //= 2
            s += n
        
        print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` test cases are processed, and for each test case, the result is printed based on the given formula. The final state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `n_back`, `s`, `m`, and `n` after all iterations will depend on the input values for each test case, but the output will be a series of integers generated from the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 50,000 test cases, where each test case consists of three integers: `n`, `k`, and an implicit `t`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of integers corresponding to the calculated results for each test case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
