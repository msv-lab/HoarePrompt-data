The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds the last element and the second largest element in the list, calculates their sum, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the cumulative effect of these sums. The function does not return any value but modifies the console output based on the input data.
