Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Dividing Books into Two Piles:**
   - The key logic here is flawed. The program does not properly divide the books into two non-empty piles.
   - It attempts to pop the last element and the largest remaining element after sorting, but this does not ensure that the two piles are non-empty and optimal.

3. **Ensuring Proper Division:**
   - To maximize the total number of pages Alice can read, we need to ensure that the largest page count book goes to one pile and the next largest to the other.
   - A better approach would be to sort the list of pages and then split the list at the middle, ensuring that the largest and second-largest elements are placed in different piles.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Sort the list of pages.
   - Split the sorted list into two parts: one part containing the largest element and the rest of the list.
   - Sum the elements of these two parts to get the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls.sort()
        # Ensure we have at least two elements
        if n < 2:
            raise ValueError("Number of books must be at least 2")
        
        # Divide the books into two piles
        max_pages = sum(ls[:-1]) + ls[-1]
        print(max_pages)

# Example Usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles optimally. Therefore, the given solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
