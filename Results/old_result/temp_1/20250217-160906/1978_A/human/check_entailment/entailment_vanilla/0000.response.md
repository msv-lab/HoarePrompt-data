### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - Alice needs to divide the books into two piles such that the sum of the highest book in each pile is maximized.
   - To maximize the sum, we need to consider the highest possible values for the two highest books, one from each pile.

2. **Input Processing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `ls`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program attempts to find the last (i.e., the highest) and the second highest values from the list of page counts.
   - This logic assumes that the last element in the list (`last`) and the second highest value in the list (`other`) will form the optimal solution.
   - However, this approach is flawed because:
     - It does not guarantee that the highest book in one pile and the second highest book in the other pile will be chosen.
     - It fails to consider all possible partitions of the books into two non-empty piles.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `4`, followed by `[2, 3, 3, 1]`.
   - The program will output `4` (choosing 3 and 1), but the correct answer should be `6` (choosing 3 and 3).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly partition the books to maximize the sum of the highest books in each pile.

**Correctness: False**
