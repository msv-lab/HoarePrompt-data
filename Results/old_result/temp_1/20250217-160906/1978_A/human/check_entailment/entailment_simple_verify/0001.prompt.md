You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.
Program:
```
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = input().split()
        last = int(ls.pop())
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        print(last + other)


```
Original Assessment: Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Dividing Books into Two Piles:**
   - The key logic here is flawed. The program does not properly divide the books into two non-empty piles.
   - It attempts to pop the last element and the largest remaining element after sorting, but this does not ensure that the two piles are non-empty and optimal.

3. **Ensuring Proper Division:**
   - To maximize the total number of pages Alice can read, we need to ensure that the largest page count book goes to one pile and the next largest to the other.
   - A better approach would be to sort the list of pages and then split the list at the middle, ensuring that the largest and second-largest elements are placed in different piles.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Sort the list of pages.
   - Split the sorted list into two parts: one part containing the largest element and the rest of the list.
   - Sum the elements of these two parts to get the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls.sort()
        # Ensure we have at least two elements
        if n < 2:
            raise ValueError("Number of books must be at least 2")
        
        # Divide the books into two piles
        max_pages = sum(ls[:-1]) + ls[-1]
        print(max_pages)

# Example Usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles optimally. Therefore, the given solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        ls = input().split()
        
        last = int(ls.pop())
        
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        
        print(last + other)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, but for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the output is the sum of the last element and the second largest element of the list `ls`. The final state includes the value of `t` and the cumulative effect of all printed values.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
