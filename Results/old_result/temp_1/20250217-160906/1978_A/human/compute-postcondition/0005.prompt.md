You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        ls = input().split()
        
        last = int(ls.pop())
        
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        
        print(last + other)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, but for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the output is the sum of the last element and the second largest element of the list `ls`. The final state includes the value of `t` and the cumulative effect of all printed values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, 'n' is an integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, and a list of 'n' integers 'a_1, a_2, ..., a_n' each between 1 and 10^9, inclusive, are provided. The function processes each test case and returns results based on the given input data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
