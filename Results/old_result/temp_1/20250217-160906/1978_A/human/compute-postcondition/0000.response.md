Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= `t` <= 500, and it is assigned the value of `int(input().strip())`.**

The code `t = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `t` (1 <= t <= 500) are maintained if the input satisfies this range, otherwise, the value of `t` would be adjusted to fit within this range. However, since no specific input value is provided, we only know that `t` is now an integer with the exact value provided by the user, which falls within the specified range.
