Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, 'n' is an integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, and a list of 'n' integers 'a_1, a_2, ..., a_n' each between 1 and 10^9, inclusive, are provided. The function processes each test case and returns results based on the given input data.**
