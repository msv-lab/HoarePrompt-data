Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a permutation of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution initializes a list `a` containing the numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then swaps elements to create a specific pattern: the odd indices are filled with ascending numbers starting from 1 up to \( n // 2 + 1 \), and the even indices are filled with descending numbers starting from \( n - i \) where \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( n // 2 - 1 \).
   - If the length of the list is odd, the last element is set to \( n // 2 + 1 \).

3. **Verification of the Solution**:
   - Consider the construction process:
     - The odd indices will contain numbers from 1 to \( n // 2 + 1 \).
     - The even indices will contain numbers from \( n \) down to \( n // 2 + 2 \).
   - By constructing the permutation in this manner, we ensure that for any two pairs of indices \( (i, i+1) \) and \( (j, j+1) \):
     - If both \( i \) and \( j \) are odd or both are even, the numbers will not divide each other because the sequence is strictly increasing or decreasing.
     - If one index is odd and the other is even, they cannot form a valid division pair because the numbers are from different sequences and thus do not share common divisors within their respective ranges.

Given the logic and the constraints, the provided solution correctly constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
