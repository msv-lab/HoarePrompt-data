Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads \( n \), the length of the permutation required.

2. **Construction of Permutation**:
   - The function initializes a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then constructs the list `a` in a specific manner:
     - The first half of the list is filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 up to \( n // 2 + 1 \).
     - The second half of the list is filled with descending integers starting from \( n - i \) where \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( n // 2 - 1 \).
   - If the length of the list is odd, the last element is set to \( n // 2 + 1 \).

3. **Verification of Permutation**:
   - Given the construction method, let's verify if the resulting permutation satisfies the condition: "there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \)."
   - For even \( n \), the first half contains consecutive numbers, and the second half contains descending numbers. This arrangement ensures that no two elements in the same half satisfy the divisibility condition because the elements in the first half are smaller and the elements in the second half are larger.
   - For odd \( n \), the last element is set to \( n // 2 + 1 \), which still maintains the property because the last element is placed appropriately without violating the condition.

Given the construction method, the permutation generated by the function adheres to the specified conditions and produces valid outputs for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
