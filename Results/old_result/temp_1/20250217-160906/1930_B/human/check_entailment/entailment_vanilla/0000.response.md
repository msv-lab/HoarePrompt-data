Let's reason through the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` (length of the permutation).

2. **Creating the Permutation Array**:
   - An array `a` is initialized with values from `1` to `n`.
   - The loop runs up to `n // 2` times, where:
     - `a[2 * i + 1]` is set to `n - i`.
     - `a[2 * i]` is set to `i + 1`.

3. **Handling Odd Lengths**:
   - If `n` is odd, the last element (`a[n - 1]`) is set to `n // 2 + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The array `a` is printed, which represents the permutation.

### Analysis:

1. **Even Length (`n` is even)**:
   - Let's consider `n = 4` as an example:
     - Initialize `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - After processing:
       - `a[0] = 1`, `a[1] = 4`
       - `a[2] = 2`, `a[3] = 3`
     - Final `a = [1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - We need to check if this permutation meets the criteria:
     - `p_1 = 1` does not divide `p_3 = 2` or `p_4 = 3`.
     - `p_2 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 2` or `p_4 = 3`.

2. **Odd Length (`n` is odd)**:
   - Let's consider `n = 3` as an example:
     - Initialize `a = [1, 2, 3]`.
     - After processing:
       - `a[0] = 1`, `a[1] = 2`, `a[2] = 3`
     - Final `a = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - We need to check if this permutation meets the criteria:
     - All elements are checked, and none of the conditions are violated.

### Validity Check:

To ensure the correctness, let's verify a few more cases:

- For `n = 6`:
  - Initial `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
  - After processing:
    - `a = [1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.
  - Check conditions:
    - `1` does not divide `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6`.
    - `6` does not divide `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`.
    - `2` does not divide `3`, `4`, or `5`.
    - `5` does not divide `3` or `4`.
    - `3` does not divide `4`.

- For `n = 7`:
  - Initial `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
  - After processing:
    - `a = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6]`.
  - Check conditions:
    - `1` does not divide `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, or `7`.
    - `3` does not divide `2`, `4`, `5`, `6`, or `7`.
    - `2` does not divide `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, or `7`.
    - `5` does not divide `3`, `4`, `6`, or `7`.
    - `4` does not divide `3`, `5`, `6`, or `7`.
    - `7` does not divide `3`, `4`, `6`, or `5`.

Given the examples and the checks, the program seems to generate a valid permutation for both even and odd lengths of `n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for all tested cases. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
