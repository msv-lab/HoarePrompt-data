Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not guarantee the construction of a permutation \( p \) that meets the specified conditions. Specifically, the logic used to construct the permutation is flawed.

Hereâ€™s why:

- The code constructs a permutation where elements are alternately placed in specific positions, which doesn't necessarily prevent the condition where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) for some \( i \neq j \).

Let's consider an example:
For \( n = 4 \), the generated permutation using the given code is:
\[ [1, 4, 2, 3] \]
This permutation does not satisfy the required condition because:
- \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \)
- \( 4 \) divides \( 4 \)

Additionally, the solution doesn't cover all possible valid permutations for every \( n \). The approach used is too restrictive and does not ensure the desired property holds for all possible permutations of \( n \).

To correctly solve this problem, one would need a different strategy, such as constructing a permutation that ensures no pair of consecutive subsequences has the divisibility condition met. One potential correct approach could involve more sophisticated construction techniques or algorithms specifically designed for this type of problem.
