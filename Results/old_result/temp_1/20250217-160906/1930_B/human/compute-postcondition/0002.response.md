Output State: The list `a` will be constructed in such a way that for each test case, the first half of the list will contain consecutive integers starting from 1 up to `n//2 + 1`, and the second half will be filled with descending integers starting from `n - i` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n//2 - 1`. If the length of the list is odd, the last element will be set to `n // 2 + 1`.
