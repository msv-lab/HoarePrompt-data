Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function processes t and n and returns specific outputs based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `n`, without these being passed as explicit parameters to the function. Instead, it likely iterates over these values and performs some operations based on the constraints provided.
