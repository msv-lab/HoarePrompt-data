Output State: The list `a` will be constructed based on the given logic. For each test case, the list `a` will be rearranged such that the odd-indexed elements will be set to `n - i` and the even-indexed elements will be set to `i + 1`, with a special case for when the length of `a` is odd, where the last element will be set to `n // 2 + 1`. The final list `a` will be printed for each test case.
