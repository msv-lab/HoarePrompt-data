Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer \( n \) (with \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)) as input. It constructs a list \( a \) of length \( n \) such that the first half of the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1 up to \( n//2 + 1 \), and the second half contains descending integers starting from \( n - i \) where \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( n//2 - 1 \). If the length of the list is odd, the last element is set to \( n // 2 + 1 \). The function then prints the constructed list for each test case.**
