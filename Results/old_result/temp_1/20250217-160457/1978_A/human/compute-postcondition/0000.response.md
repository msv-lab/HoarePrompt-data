Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is an input integer; no other variables have been updated.**

The code `t = int(input().strip())` reads an integer from the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, the new value of `t` will still fall within this range. No other variables (`n` or the list of integers) are affected by this code.
