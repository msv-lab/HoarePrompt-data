Output State: The output state will consist of 500 lines, each line containing the sum of the largest and second-largest numbers from the space-separated integers provided in each input line, for each of the `t` iterations.

Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 500. In each iteration, it reads a number `n`, followed by a line of space-separated integers. It then removes and stores the last integer in the list as `last`, sorts the remaining integers, and takes the second largest as `other`. The sum of `last` and `other` is printed for each iteration. After all iterations, there will be 500 printed outputs, each representing the sum of the last and second-largest numbers from the respective input lines.
