Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variable `i` is the loop iterator.
   - The variable `t` is used as the upper limit for the range function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - The problem states that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is an input integer.
   - There are no other variables mentioned that are being used or modified within the loop.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be at least 1 because the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `t`.
   - The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 before the first iteration of the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, and `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be initialized to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
