Output State: If `i` is less than 0 initially, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` remain the same. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0 initially, `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the range [1, 30] for `n` and `m`, and [1, 1000] for `r`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `shares` holds the total shares calculated, `i` is incremented by 1.

No changes to the initial state as the loop will not execute due to the condition `i < 0`.
