Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order. The values in the list `b` are rearranged in reverse order. After sorting, the list `b` will be in reverse sorted order. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, and `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, and `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order**
