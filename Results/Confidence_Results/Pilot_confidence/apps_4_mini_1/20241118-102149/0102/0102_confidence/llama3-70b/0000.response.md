Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **100** 

The program correctly converts integers from 0 to 99 into their corresponding English words, following the problem description. It handles the cases for numbers less than 10, numbers between 10 and 19, and numbers from 20 to 99 correctly. 

- For numbers 0 to 9, it uses the `ones` list.
- For numbers 10 to 19, it uses the `teens` list.
- For numbers 20 to 99, it combines the appropriate entry from the `tens` list with the `ones` list, using a hyphen when necessary.

All edge cases, including the boundaries (0, 10, 20, 99), are correctly addressed. Since I can't find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements, I am confident in my assessment.
