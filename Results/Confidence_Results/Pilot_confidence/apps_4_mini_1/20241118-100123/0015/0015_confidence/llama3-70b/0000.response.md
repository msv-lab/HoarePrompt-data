Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **90**

The provided program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite integer \( b \) appears in the infinite arithmetic sequence defined by the first element \( a \) and the common difference \( c \).

Here's the reasoning:

1. **When \( c = 0 \)**: The sequence is constant, consisting solely of the value \( a \). The program checks if \( a \) is equal to \( b \) and prints "YES" if they are the same, otherwise it prints "NO". This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **When \( c \neq 0 \)**: The program checks if \( (b - a) \) is divisible by \( c \) and if \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative. This ensures that starting from \( a \) and adding \( c \) repeatedly can reach \( b \). If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This logic accurately reflects the requirements of the problem description.

The only edge case that could be considered is when \( c \) is negative, but the program correctly handles this by ensuring that \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative, which would mean \( b \) can only be reached if it is less than or equal to \( a \) when \( c \) is negative.

I am confident in this assessment because the logic covers all possible scenarios outlined in the problem description, and I have not identified any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements. However, I have left a small margin in confidence due to the complexity of edge cases in arithmetic sequences.
