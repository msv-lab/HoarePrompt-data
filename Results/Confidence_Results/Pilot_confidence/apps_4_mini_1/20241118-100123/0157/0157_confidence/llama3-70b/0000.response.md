Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how it works:
1. It takes input for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the constraints of the recipe. This is done by determining how many complete sets can be formed with the available fruits:
   - For lemons, you can use `a` lemons.
   - For apples, since each lemon requires 2 apples, you can use `b // 2` apples.
   - For pears, since each lemon requires 4 pears, you can use `c // 4` pears.
3. The minimum of these three values gives the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is stored in `min_lemon`.
4. The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which corresponds to the total number of fruits used (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears for each complete set).

The program handles edge cases correctly:
- If any of the fruits are insufficient to make even one complete set (e.g., not enough pears), it will correctly return 0.
- It correctly calculates the total number of fruits based on the maximum number of complete sets that can be formed.

The only reason for not giving a full 100% confidence is the potential for input errors or unexpected input types, but as per the problem description, it adheres to the requirements for the specified input range.
