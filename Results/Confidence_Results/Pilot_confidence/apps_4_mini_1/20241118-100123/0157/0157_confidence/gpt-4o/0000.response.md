Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the specified ratio of lemons, apples, and pears (1:2:4). 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. The program reads the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) based on the limiting factor among the available fruits:
   - It uses `a` (the number of lemons) directly.
   - It checks how many apples can be used by dividing `b` by 2 (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon).
   - It checks how many pears can be used by dividing `c` by 4 (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated using the formula: `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are not enough pears or apples to make even one compote, resulting in an output of 0.

I am confident in this assessment, but there is always a slight chance of overlooking edge cases, hence the confidence level of 90.
