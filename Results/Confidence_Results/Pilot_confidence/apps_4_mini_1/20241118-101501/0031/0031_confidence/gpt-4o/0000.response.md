To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and how it aligns with the requirements.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which represent the number of days (2^n) and the number of people (k).

2. **Edge Case for k**: The program checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If it is, it prints `1 1`, which represents that there is a 100% probability of at least two people sharing a birthday. This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Calculating the Probability**:
   - The program calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n`.
   - It initializes `numerator` and `denominator` for the probability calculation.
   - A loop runs `k` times to compute the probabilities of no shared birthdays, updating the `numerator` and `denominator` accordingly.

4. **Final Probability Calculation**:
   - It computes the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday by subtracting the probability of no shared birthdays from the total.
   - The program then simplifies the fraction A/B by dividing by the greatest common divisor (gcd).

5. **Output**: The program prints the values of A and B modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Large Values of n and k**: Given that `n` and `k` can both be as large as `10^18`, the calculations involving `1 << n` could lead to integer overflow in some programming environments. However, Python handles large integers natively. 

2. **Numerical Stability**: The algorithm relies on modular arithmetic, which can introduce complexities. The program correctly uses modulo operations, but edge cases around `MOD` and reductions might need careful handling.

3. **Irreducibility Check**: The program uses `func_1` to compute the gcd and reduces A and B accordingly. This should ensure that A and B are coprime before taking modulo.

4. **Edge Case for k = 1**: If `k` is 1, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday should be 0 (not 1). The program does not handle this edge case explicitly, but since `k` must be at least 2 according to the problem constraints, this is not an issue.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, I see that the program seems to handle the requirements of the problem description well, including edge cases for large values of `n` and `k`. The calculations of A and B and their simplification appear correct. 

However, I am slightly concerned about the clarity of the output when `k` is very large relative to `2^n`, as it could lead to overflow in other environments, but Python's handling of large integers mitigates this.

Overall, I cannot find a specific case where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**, Confidence: **90**.
