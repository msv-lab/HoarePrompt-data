Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**

The provided program does not handle the case where \( k > 2^n \) correctly. According to the problem description, if there are more people than days, it is guaranteed that at least two people will share the same birthday, which means the output should be \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 1 \). However, the program does not include a check for this condition; instead, it continues to calculate the probability as if \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2^n \).

For example, if we input \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 3 \):
- The correct output should be \( 1 \) \( 1 \) since there are only \( 2^1 = 2 \) days and \( 3 \) people.
- However, the program would attempt to calculate the numerator and denominator without recognizing that \( k > 2^n \) leads to a guaranteed overlap.

Thus, the program fails for this case, demonstrating that it is not correct overall.
