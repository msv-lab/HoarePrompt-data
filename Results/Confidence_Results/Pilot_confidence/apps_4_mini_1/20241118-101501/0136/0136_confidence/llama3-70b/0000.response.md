Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

The provided program has a potential issue when comparing very large integers that have leading zeros. While the `lstrip('0')` method effectively removes leading zeros, it can lead to an incorrect comparison in the case where both numbers are zero. For example:

Input:
```
0000
0000
```

The program would strip the leading zeros and compare two empty strings, which would incorrectly evaluate as equal. However, the correct output should be `=` since both numbers are indeed equal (both represent zero).

Additionally, if one number is `0000` and another is `0`, the program will also evaluate them the same way and produce the correct output. But if both inputs are entirely zeros, the handling of empty strings could lead to confusion.

Thus, the program does not handle this edge case correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
