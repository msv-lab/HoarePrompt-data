To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it returns "No". This logic is based on the observation that if `k >= n`, then the remainders for `1` and `n` will be the same (both yielding `0`).
3. If `k < n`, it initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to track the distinct remainders.
4. The program then iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` (`n % i`).
5. If a remainder has already been seen (i.e., it exists in the set), it returns "No".
6. If all remainders are distinct by the end of the loop, it returns "Yes".

### Potential Issues:
1. The condition `if k >= n:` is correct because if `k` is equal to or greater than `n`, the remainder `n % n` will be `0`, which will match with `n % 1` (also `0`), thus returning "No".
2. The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, and the logic of checking the remainders is sound. However, it does not handle the case where `k` is significantly larger than `n`. In particular, when `k` is larger than `n`, the program will still return "No", but it fails to account for the fact that for any `i > n`, the remainder will be `n` itself (which will not affect the distinctiveness of the remainders already calculated).

### Test Cases:
- For `n = 10` and `k = 15`, the program would incorrectly return "No" since `k` is greater than `n`, but the remainders from `1` to `10` would be distinct: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` (and `10 % 11` through `10 % 15` would yield `10` which does not duplicate any previous remainders).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than `n` and therefore incorrectly returns "No" in situations where it should return "Yes". 

Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

I am confident in this assessment because the logic fails to account for the distinctiveness of remainders when `k` exceeds `n`, which is a crucial part of the problem description.
