Correctness: **True**, Confidence: **100**

Explanation: The program takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and correctly returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program iterates through the input list and extracts the first and second elements of each sublist as required. The logic seems correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
