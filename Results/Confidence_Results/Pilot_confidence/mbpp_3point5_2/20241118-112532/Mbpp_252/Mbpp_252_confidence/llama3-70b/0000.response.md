Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes a complex number as input and returns the absolute value (magnitude) of the complex number and its phase (angle) in polar coordinates. The program uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the magnitude and `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase, which is correct according to the problem description. The program does not have any logical errors and will work correctly for all complex numbers.
