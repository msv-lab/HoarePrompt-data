Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the count method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as when the element is not in the tuple, when the element appears multiple times, and when the element appears only once. The program passes all the test cases and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
