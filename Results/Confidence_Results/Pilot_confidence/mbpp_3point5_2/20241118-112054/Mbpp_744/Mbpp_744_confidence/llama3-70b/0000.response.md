Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The given program correctly uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check if there is any `None` value in the input tuple. This logic covers all potential cases where the tuple may contain a `None` value. Since the program is simple and directly addresses the problem description, I am confident that it is correct for all cases.
