Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in the list that xor to an even number. It first calculates the number of even and odd integers in the list, then calculates the number of pairs for both even and odd integers separately, and finally returns the sum of these pairs. The provided test cases also pass, confirming the correctness of the program.
