Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The given function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and checks if all the characters in the string are the same by converting the string to a set (which removes duplicates) and checking if the length of the set is 1. This logic is correct and will work for all potential cases. Since there is no scenario where this logic would fail, I am 100% confident that the program is correct.
