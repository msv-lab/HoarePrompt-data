Correctness: False, Confidence: 100

The program is incorrect because it does not return the correct difference between two lists as described in the problem statement. For example, when `list1 = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]` and `list2 = [25, 40, 35]`, the expected output should be `[10, 15, 20, 30]` instead of `[10, 20, 30, 15]`. This shows that the program is not handling the difference calculation correctly.
