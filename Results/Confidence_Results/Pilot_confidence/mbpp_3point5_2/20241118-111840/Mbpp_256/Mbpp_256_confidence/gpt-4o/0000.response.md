Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given number. The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to the given number. The assertions in the program are testing for some specific cases (5, 10, 100) and the results match the expected number of prime numbers less than the given input. Since the program handles these cases correctly and follows the problem description for all potential cases, we can be confident in its correctness.
