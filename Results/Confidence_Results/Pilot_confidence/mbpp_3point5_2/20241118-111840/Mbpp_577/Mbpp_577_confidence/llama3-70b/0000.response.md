Correctness: False, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as per the problem description. The program only returns 0 for any input greater than 4, which is incorrect. The correct approach to find the last digit in the factorial of a given number is to actually compute the factorial and then find the last digit. Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, it is incorrect.
