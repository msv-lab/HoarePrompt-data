Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tup)`, and then concatenates it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. This implementation follows the problem description accurately and should work correctly for all cases where a tuple is added to a list.
