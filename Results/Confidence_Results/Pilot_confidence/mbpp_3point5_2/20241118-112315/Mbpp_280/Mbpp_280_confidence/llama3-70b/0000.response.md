Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The function iterates through the array using the `enumerate` function to keep track of the index. It then checks if the current element is equal to the given element. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple with `True` as the first element and the index as the second element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with `False` as the first element and -1 as the second element. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
