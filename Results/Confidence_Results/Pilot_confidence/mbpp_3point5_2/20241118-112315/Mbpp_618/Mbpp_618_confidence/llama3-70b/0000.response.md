Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The function checks if the two input lists are of the same length and raises a `ValueError` if they are not. Then, it performs element-wise division of the two lists using a list comprehension with `zip()`. This ensures that the division is done element by element for lists of the same length. The logic of the function aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
