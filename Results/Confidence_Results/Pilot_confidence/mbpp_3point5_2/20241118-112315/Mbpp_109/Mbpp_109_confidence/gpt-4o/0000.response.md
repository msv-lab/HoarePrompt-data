Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

The program iterates through each rotation of the binary string and checks if the integer value of the rotated binary string is odd. It then counts the number of rotations where the integer value is odd. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the program logic seems to be correctly implemented. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not follow the problem description.
