Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through numbers starting from 1 and checks if each digit can be formed using the available cubes. The can_form_number function correctly checks if a number can be formed using the given cubes. The program terminates when it can no longer form the next number, which is the maximum number Masha can make. The program handles all potential cases and edge cases described in the problem statement.
