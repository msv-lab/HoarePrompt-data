Explanation: The program iterates through the alphabet and replaces each character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order until it forms the English alphabet as a subsequence. If the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the English alphabet), it prints the string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The program follows the problem description accurately and works correctly for all potential cases.
