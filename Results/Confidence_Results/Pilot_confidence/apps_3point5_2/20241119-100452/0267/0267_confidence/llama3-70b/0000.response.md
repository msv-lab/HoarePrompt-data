Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `count` calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits up to a given number, and the main function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum by subtracting the counts for $l-1$ from the count for $r$. The modulo operation is also correctly applied. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
