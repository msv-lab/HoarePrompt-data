Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the given problem description. It calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to check if a number meets the condition of having at most $k$ different digits and to calculate the total sum accordingly. The program iterates through the range of numbers from $l$ to $r$ and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition. The modulo operation is correctly applied to the total sum. All the provided examples are correctly calculated by the program, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. Hence, the correctness is True with high confidence.
