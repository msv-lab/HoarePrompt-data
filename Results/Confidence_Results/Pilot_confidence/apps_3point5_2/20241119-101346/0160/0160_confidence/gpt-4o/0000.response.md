Correctness: True, Confidence: 90

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of N, K, and the list of integers A.
2. The program defines two functions, func_1 to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of numbers and func_2 to find all divisors of a given number.
3. The program calculates the sum of the list A and finds the greatest common divisor of the list A.
4. It then finds all the divisors of the sum of A and iterates through them to check if each divisor can divide every element of A after the operations.
5. If a divisor is found that satisfies the condition for all elements in A, it prints that divisor as the output.
6. The program correctly follows the problem description and logic to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
7. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.
