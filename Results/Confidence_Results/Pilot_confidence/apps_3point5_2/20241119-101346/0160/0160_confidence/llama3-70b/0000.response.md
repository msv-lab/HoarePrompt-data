Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements of A, then iterates through all potential divisors up to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum divisor. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all possible cases. The program handles the constraints provided and produces the correct output for the given input.
