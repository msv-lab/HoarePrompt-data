Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the balance of the given string and checks if the balance matches the desired balance $x$. If it does, it prints $n+1$ as the number of prefixes. If the balance difference is a multiple of the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s in the string, it prints -1 indicating an infinite number of prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to reach the desired balance and prints that value. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and edge cases provided.
