Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the remainder of the input number when divided by 10. It then checks if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, in which case it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from the input number. If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to the input number. This logic covers all possible cases where Vasya needs to round the number to the nearest integer ending in 0.
