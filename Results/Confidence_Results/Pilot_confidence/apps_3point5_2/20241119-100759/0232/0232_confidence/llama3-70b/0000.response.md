Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the color counts for each window of Jedi Knights, and checks if there exists a contiguous interval where the color counts match the desired counts. The program iterates through all possible windows and checks if the counts match the desired counts. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
