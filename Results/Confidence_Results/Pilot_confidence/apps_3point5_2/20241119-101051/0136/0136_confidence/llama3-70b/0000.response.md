Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

I am confident that the program is correct for all potential cases. The program reads two very long integers as strings, removes any leading zeroes, and then compares them lexicographically to determine which number is greater or if they are equal. The logic provided in the code correctly follows the problem description and all the given examples.
