Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b from input, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them as described in the problem statement. It handles the cases where a < b, a > b, and a = b correctly. The logic provided in the code covers all possible scenarios and the program seems to be working correctly for all cases.
