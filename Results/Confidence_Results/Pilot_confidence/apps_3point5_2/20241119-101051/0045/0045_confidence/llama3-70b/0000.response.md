Correctness: False, Confidence: 100

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the greatest common divisor of the resulting sequence is maximal. For example, for the input 6 3, the program outputs 1 2 3, but the sequence 1 5 is a better solution with a higher greatest common divisor.
