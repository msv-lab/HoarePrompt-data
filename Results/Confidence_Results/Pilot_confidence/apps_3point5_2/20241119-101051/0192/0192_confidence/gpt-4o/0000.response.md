Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The program uses the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2) to calculate this, which aligns with the problem description. The logic of subtracting y from x, dividing by 2, and adding the remainder when dividing by 2 ensures that the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the program takes into account the constraints provided for the input values.
