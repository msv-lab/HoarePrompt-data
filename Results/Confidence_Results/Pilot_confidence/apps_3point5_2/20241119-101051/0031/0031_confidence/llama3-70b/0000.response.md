Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given scenario. It computes the probability as an irreducible fraction and takes into account the modulo operation as required in the problem description. The logic of the program aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
