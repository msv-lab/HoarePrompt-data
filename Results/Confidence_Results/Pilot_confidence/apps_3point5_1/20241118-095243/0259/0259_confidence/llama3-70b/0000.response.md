Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by iterating through each bus route, calculating the time until the next bus arrival based on the current time Serval goes to the station, and then determining the bus route Serval will use based on the minimum time calculated. The logic seems sound and covers all possible cases described in the problem statement.
