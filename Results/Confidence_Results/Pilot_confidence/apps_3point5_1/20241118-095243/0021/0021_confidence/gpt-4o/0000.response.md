Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by swapping exactly one element. It considers all possible distances by calculating the absolute differences between the minimum and maximum element positions and the first and last positions in the array. The maximum of these distances is then printed as the output. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
