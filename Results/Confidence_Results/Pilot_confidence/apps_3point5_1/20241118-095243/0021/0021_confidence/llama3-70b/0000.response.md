Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculating the maximum possible distance between them by performing exactly one swap. The logic of finding the positions and calculating the distances seems to cover all potential cases, and the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.
