Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through each bus route, calculates the wait time for Serval, and chooses the route with the minimum wait time. The implementation covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including when Serval arrives before the first bus, when the wait time is zero, and when multiple buses arrive at the same time. The program also handles the case where there are multiple possible answers and allows for any of them to be printed.

3. The `func_2` function correctly finds all the divisors of the sum of all elements in `A`.
4. The program then iterates through the divisors in descending order and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element of `A` after the operations. If a divisor is found that satisfies this condition, it is printed as the output.
5. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and correctly finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A`.
