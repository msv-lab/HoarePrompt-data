Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program iterates through each character of the alphabet and replaces it in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. It then checks if the resulting string contains all the characters of the alphabet. If it does, it prints the result, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program seems correct and it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
