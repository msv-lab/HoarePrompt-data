Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The count function calculates the number of valid numbers within a given range and with a given number of different digits, and the main function then calculates the sum of these numbers modulo $998244353$. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and the examples provided in the problem description.
