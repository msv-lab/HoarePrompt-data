Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y based on the starting equilateral triangle side length x. The formula used `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` is derived from the fact that in each step, Memory can decrease the side length by 2 until reaching the desired length y, with an additional step needed if the difference between x and y is odd. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring the correctness of the output.
