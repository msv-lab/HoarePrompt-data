Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program takes an input of two integers n and k, calculates the minimum sum of a sequence of k numbers, checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, calculates the divisor d, and then constructs a sequence of k numbers based on the divisor and the remainder. The program then outputs the resulting sequence or -1 if no answer exists. The implementation follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected output for all possible cases.
