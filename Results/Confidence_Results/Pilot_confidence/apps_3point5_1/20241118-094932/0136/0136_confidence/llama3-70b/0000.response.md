Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b, removes any leading zeroes, and then compares them as required by the problem description. The logic used to determine whether a is less than, equal to, or greater than b is correct and covers all cases mentioned in the problem description. The program will output the correct symbol ("<", "=", or ">") based on the comparison of a and b. The program handles the input constraints and the specified output format. Overall, the program meets all the requirements mentioned in the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
