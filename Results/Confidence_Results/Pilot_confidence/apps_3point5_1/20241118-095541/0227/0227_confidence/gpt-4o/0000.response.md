Correctness: False, Confidence: 90

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not implement the logic to check if the sum of two variables is equal to the current value to be assigned. Additionally, the program is missing the import statement for the sys module. 

An example where the program does not work correctly is for the following input:
Input
3
3 6 5

Output
-1

For the above input, the program should output -1, but it will output 2 instead. This is because the program does not consider all possible combinations of summing up two variables to get the desired value.
