Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all the remainders are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far and exits the loop if it encounters a duplicate remainder. The program then prints "No" if a duplicate remainder is found, otherwise, it prints "Yes". The logic of the program seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
