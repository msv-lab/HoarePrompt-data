Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k and checks if the remainder is already in the set. If it is, it returns 'No', indicating that the remainders are not distinct. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases.
