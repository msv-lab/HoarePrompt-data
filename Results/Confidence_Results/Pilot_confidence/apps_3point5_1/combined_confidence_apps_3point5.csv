Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through each bus route, calculates the wait time for Serval, and chooses the route with the minimum wait time. The implementation covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including when Serval arrives before the first bus, when the wait time is zero, and when multiple buses arrive at the same time. The program also handles the case where there are multiple possible answers and allows for any of them to be printed.

4. The program then iterates through the divisors in descending order and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element of `A` after the operations. If a divisor is found that satisfies this condition, it is printed as the output.
5. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and correctly finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A`.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The `func_1` function checks if a number has at most $k$ different digits, and the `func_2` function iterates through the range of numbers from $l$ to $r$ and adds them to the total sum if they satisfy the condition.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired color counts can be achieved. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the color counts in the current window and compares it with the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets the found flag to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints ""YES"" if a matching interval is found, otherwise ""NO"".

For example, when n = 5, the program correctly outputs 0, and when n = 113, the program outputs 110, which are both valid according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.",True,,pilot_apps2.json

Calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$.

A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string ""abcd"" has 5 prefixes: empty string, ""a"", ""ab"", ""abc"" and ""abcd"".

The first line contains the single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2T$ lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$) — the length of string $s$ and the desired balance, respectively.

В первом тестовом примере Эдвард находится в 4 подъезде на 10 этаже, а Наташа находится в 1 подъезде на 2 этаже. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно сначала спуститься на лифте на первый этаж (на это он потратит 19 секунд, из которых 10 — на ожидание и 9 — на поездку на лифте), затем обойти дом против часовой стрелки до подъезда номер 1 (на это он потратит 15 секунд), и наконец подняться по лестнице на этаж номер 2 (на это он потратит 5 секунд). Таким образом, ответ равен 19 + 15 + 5 = 39.

Во втором тестовом примере Эдвард живёт в подъезде 2 на этаже 1, а Наташа находится в подъезде 1 на этаже 1. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно просто обойти дом по часовой стрелке до подъезда 1, на это он потратит 15 секунд.","# Function to calculate minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment

Explanation: The given program takes two integers x and y as input representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths, respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The logic used in the program is to calculate the difference between x and y, divide it by 2, and add the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and all the provided examples. Additionally, since the program is a simple mathematical calculation based on the problem requirements, there are no edge cases or scenarios where it might fail to produce the correct output.

Explanation: The program takes an input of two positive integers `n` and `k`, then calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of length `k` using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. It checks if the minimum sum is greater than `n`, returns -1 if true. Otherwise, it calculates the common divisor `d` and the remainder. It then constructs the sequence by distributing the remainder among the elements to maximize the greatest common divisor. The program outputs the resulting sequence or -1 if no possible sequence exists.

Explanation: 
The given program takes an input of two positive integers n and k, then calculates the minimum sum possible with k numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. If this minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence. Otherwise, it calculates the value d which is n divided by the minimum sum, and the remainder. It then constructs a sequence of k numbers where each number is a multiple of d. If there is a remainder, it distributes it among the numbers in the sequence. The program then prints the resulting sequence or -1 if there is no possible sequence.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the cases mentioned in the problem statement. The logic provided correctly constructs a sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is n and maximizes the greatest common divisor. The code also outputs -1 when there is no possible sequence. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the examples, the program is correct.",True,,pilot_apps3.json

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.


-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.

-----Note-----

In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.

In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.","import math

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
2. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure that A and B are coprime before printing them.
3. The program calculates the probability correctly using the given formula and handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n.
4. The program computes the greatest common divisor correctly using the Euclidean algorithm in func_1.
