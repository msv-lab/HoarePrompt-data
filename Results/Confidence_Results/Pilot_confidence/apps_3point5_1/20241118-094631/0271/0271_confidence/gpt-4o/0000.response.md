Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided program correctly rounds the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0 as described in the problem statement. It checks the remainder when dividing the input number by 10, and then rounds down or up accordingly. The logic covers all possible cases and provides the correct output. Additionally, the program handles the scenario where the remainder is exactly 5 by rounding down. Overall, based on the problem description and the implementation of the program, it appears to be correct for all cases.
