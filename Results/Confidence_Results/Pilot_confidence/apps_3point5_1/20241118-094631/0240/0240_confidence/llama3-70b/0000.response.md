Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` and appends only the characters that are present in `t` to a new string `n`. Finally, it concatenates `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string. This logic aligns with the problem description, as it reconstructs the smallest possible integer `n` based on the substring `t` that Vasya remembers. The program handles the case where `n` contains leading zeroes by ensuring that the resulting integer `n` has no leading zeroes except when `n` is zero itself. The program also correctly handles the case where there are multiple ways to restore the number `n`. Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
