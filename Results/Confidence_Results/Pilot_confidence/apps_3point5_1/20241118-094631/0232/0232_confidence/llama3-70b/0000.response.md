Correctness: True
Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the color counts for each window of Jedi Knights, and checks if there is a window that matches the desired color counts. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program iterates through all possible windows of Jedi Knights and checks if the color counts match the desired counts. Therefore, I am confident that the program is correct.
