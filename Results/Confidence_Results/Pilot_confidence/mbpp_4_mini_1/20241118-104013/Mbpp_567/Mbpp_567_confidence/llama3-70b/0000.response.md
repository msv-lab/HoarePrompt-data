Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The program correctly checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression to compare each element with the next one in the list. The logic ensures that for every pair of adjacent elements, the first element is less than or equal to the second. 

The program handles edge cases, such as:
- An empty list, which is considered sorted.
- A list with one element, which is also considered sorted.
- A list where all elements are equal, which is considered sorted.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I am confident in stating that the program is correct. However, I rated my confidence as 90 instead of 100 to account for the inherent uncertainty in code verification without exhaustive testing.
