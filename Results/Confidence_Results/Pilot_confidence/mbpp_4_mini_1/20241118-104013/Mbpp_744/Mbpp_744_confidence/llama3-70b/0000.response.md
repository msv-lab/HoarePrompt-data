Correctness: **False** , Confidence: **90**

The provided program checks if there are any `None` values in the given tuple. However, the problem description states to check if the tuple has any `none` value or not, which typically implies a case-sensitive check for the string "none" rather than the `None` object in Python.

For example, if the input tuple is `("none", 1, 2)`, the program would return `False` because it only checks for the `None` object, not the string "none". This discrepancy means the program does not fulfill the requirement as described.

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify the presence of the string "none", which is a potential case where it does not work as expected.
