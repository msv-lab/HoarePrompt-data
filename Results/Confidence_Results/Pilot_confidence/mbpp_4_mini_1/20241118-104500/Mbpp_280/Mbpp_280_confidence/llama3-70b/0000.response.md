Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element as inputs, iterates through the array, and checks if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`. 

The function handles all potential cases:
1. If the element is present in the array, it correctly returns `True` and the index.
2. If the element is not present, it returns `False` and `-1`.
3. The function will also work correctly with edge cases such as an empty array, where it will return `(False, -1)`.

The only reason the confidence is not at 100 is that while the implementation appears correct, edge cases are always subject to further scrutiny. However, based on the analysis, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
