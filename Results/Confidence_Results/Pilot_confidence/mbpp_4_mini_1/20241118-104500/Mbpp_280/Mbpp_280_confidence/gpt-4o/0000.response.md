Correctness: **True**, Confidence: **90**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element, checks if the element is present in the array, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating the presence of the element and the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. 

The function uses `enumerate` to iterate through the array, which allows it to keep track of both the index and the value of each element. If the value matches the element being searched for, it returns `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

I am confident in this assessment because I considered various scenarios, including:
- An element that is present in the array (as shown in the assertions).
- An element that is not present in the array (the program correctly returns `(False, -1)` in such cases).

However, to be 100% confident, I would need to consider edge cases such as:
- An empty array: `func_1([], 1)` should return `(False, -1)`.
- Searching for `None` in an array that contains `None`: `func_1([None, 1, 2], None)` should return `(True, 0)`.
- Searching for an element that is not in the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)` should return `(False, -1)`.

Since the function behaves correctly in the scenarios I tested, I have a high level of confidence in its correctness, but I acknowledge that there could be more edge cases to consider to reach a confidence level of 100.
