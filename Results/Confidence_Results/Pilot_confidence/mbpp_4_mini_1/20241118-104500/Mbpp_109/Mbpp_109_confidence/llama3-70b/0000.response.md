To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's first understand the problem description and the code.

**Problem Description**: The task is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

**Program Analysis**:
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```

1. **String Extension**: The program extends the string `s` by repeating it enough times to ensure that it can accommodate `n` rotations. The expression `s * (n // len(s) + 1)` is intended to create a sufficiently long string.

2. **Counting Odd Values**: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each rotation (represented by the index `i`), it extracts a substring of length equal to the original string `s`. It counts the number of '1's in this substring and checks if that count is odd (`% 2`).

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of substrings that have an odd number of '1's after `n` rotations.

**Potential Issues**:
- The program may not correctly handle cases where `n` is less than the length of `s`. For example, if `s = "11"` and `n = 1`, the program will consider the substring starting at index 0, which is `"1"`, and it would count it as odd. However, the problem description isn't clear on how to interpret "rotating" a string in this context.
- The program does not explicitly handle cases where the input string `s` is empty or when `n` is zero.

**Test Case Consideration**:
- For `s = "0"` and `n = 5`, the expected output should be `0` since there are no '1's at all.
- For `s = "1"` and `n = 5`, the expected output should be `5` since every rotation will yield a substring with one '1', which is odd.
- For `s = "10"` and `n = 3`, the expected output should be `2` since the substrings will be `"10"`, `"01"`, and `"10"` respectively, resulting in odd counts for the first and last substrings.

Considering these points, the program does not seem to handle edge cases properly, particularly when `s` is empty or when `n` is less than the length of `s`.

**Conclusion**:
Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**  

The program fails to correctly handle some edge cases, particularly when the input string `s` is empty or when `n` is less than the length of `s`. This leads to a conclusion that the program does not fulfill the problem description in all cases.
