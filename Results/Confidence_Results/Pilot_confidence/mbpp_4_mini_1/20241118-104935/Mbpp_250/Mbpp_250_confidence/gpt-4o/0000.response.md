Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to count occurrences of an element in a tuple using the `count` method of a tuple. The assertions provided in the program check for specific cases: 

1. It verifies that the element `4` is not present in the tuple, which correctly returns `0`.
2. It confirms that the element `10` appears `3` times in the tuple, which is accurate.
3. It checks that the element `8` appears `4` times in the tuple, which is also correct.

The `count` method of a tuple is designed to return the number of occurrences of a specified value, so the function should work correctly for any input tuple and element. 

I am confident in this assessment, but I left a margin for potential edge cases that might not have been considered, such as handling of different data types or empty tuples, which could affect the outcome. However, since the problem description does not specify any restrictions on the types of elements in the tuple, the implementation is generally sound for the given task.
