Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The provided function `func_1` correctly takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements, and returns a list containing two lists: the first list consists of the first elements of each sublist, and the second list consists of the second elements of each sublist.

I am confident in this assessment because:

1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, extracting the first and second elements correctly.
2. It constructs two separate lists, ensuring that the output format matches the problem description.
3. The function should work for any valid input as specified in the problem description.

However, I have a slight reservation (hence the confidence of 90) because the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input might not strictly adhere to the requirement of having sublists with exactly two elements. For example, if an empty list or a list with sublists of varying lengths is passed, it could lead to an `IndexError`. Nonetheless, since the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, I consider the function correct under the assumption that the input will always meet the specified format.
