Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

The provided program is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the implementation only retains uppercase characters and removes all lowercase characters. 

For example, given the input string "HelloWorld", the expected output should be "HelloWorld" since there are no lowercase substrings to remove. However, if given the input "aBcDeFg", the expected output should be "BCDF", but the program will return "BCDF", which is correct in this case. 

However, the program does not handle the case where lowercase substrings need to be removed entirely, meaning if there are any lowercase letters, they should not appear in the output at all. 

For instance, if the input is "abcde", the expected output should be an empty string "", but the program will return an empty string as well, which is correct. 

However, if the input contains a mix of cases, such as "AbCdeF", the output should only remove the lowercase "de", resulting in "ABCDF". The program does not consider the substring removal logic correctly as per the problem description.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
