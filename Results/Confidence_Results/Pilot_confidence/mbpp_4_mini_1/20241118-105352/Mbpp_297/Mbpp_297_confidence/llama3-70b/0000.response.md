Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It uses recursion to check each element in the input list. If an element is itself a list, it recursively flattens that list and extends the `flat_list` with the returned values. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to `flat_list`.

I believe the function handles all potential cases for flattening nested lists, including:
1. Empty lists.
2. Lists containing other lists at various depths.
3. Lists containing non-list elements (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).

The only reason my confidence is not at 100 is that I cannot foresee every possible edge case or input variation that could be tested, but based on standard use cases, the function appears robust and effective.
