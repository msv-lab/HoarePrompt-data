Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20' using the `str.replace` method. It handles all potential cases, including:

1. Strings with multiple spaces.
2. Strings with leading and trailing spaces.
3. Strings without any spaces.
4. Empty strings.

The function will replace every occurrence of a space with '%20', which is exactly what the problem description requires. 

I am confident in this assessment as the `replace` method is designed to handle all instances of the specified substring, and I cannot think of any edge cases that would lead to incorrect behavior based on the problem description. The only reason my confidence is not at 100 is the inherent uncertainty that comes with not testing every possible input.
