Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. The function `is_prime` accurately checks if a number is prime by returning `False` for numbers less than 2 and checking for divisibility for numbers greater than or equal to 2.

The outer loop iterates from 2 to `n-1`, and for each number, it uses the `is_prime` function to determine if it's prime. The count of prime numbers is incremented accordingly. 

The edge cases, such as when `n` is 0 or 1, are also handled correctly since the range `range(2, n)` will be empty for these values, resulting in a count of 0, which is the expected output.

The only potential edge cases that could be considered are negative inputs; however, the problem description specifies that the input will be a non-negative number, so the function's behavior is as expected for all valid inputs. 

I am slightly less than 100% confident because while the code appears correct for the specified input constraints, there could always be unforeseen edge cases in broader interpretations of input handling. However, given the constraints provided, the program meets the requirements effectively.
