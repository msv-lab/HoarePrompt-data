Correctness: **False** , Confidence: **90**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when `n` is 0 or 1. According to the definition of factorial, both 0! and 1! are equal to 1, and thus the last digit of both should be 1. However, the program does not check for these cases specifically and will incorrectly return 0 for these inputs since it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 5 to return 0. 

For example:
- `func_1(0)` should return 1, but will not be handled correctly.
- `func_1(1)` should also return 1, but will not be handled correctly.

This shows that the program fails to account for edge cases, leading to incorrect results.
