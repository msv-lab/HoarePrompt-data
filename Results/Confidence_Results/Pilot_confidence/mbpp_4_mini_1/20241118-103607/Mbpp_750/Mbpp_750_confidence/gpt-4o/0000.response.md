Correctness: **True**, Confidence: **90**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to add the elements of a given tuple to a given list. 

The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it with the original list. The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given test cases.

I am confident that the function will work correctly for a variety of inputs, including edge cases such as:
- An empty list and a non-empty tuple: `func_1([], (1, 2))` should return `[1, 2]`.
- A non-empty list and an empty tuple: `func_1([1, 2], ())` should return `[1, 2]`.
- Both the list and the tuple being empty: `func_1([], ())` should return `[]`.

While I am confident in the correctness of the function based on the provided examples and additional reasoning, I assigned a confidence level of 90 instead of 100 to reflect that there could be edge cases not considered without further testing. However, based on the current understanding, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
