To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze how well the program meets the requirements.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of variables `m` needed to perform a series of operations based on a given sequence of distinct positive integers. The operations involve assigning values to these variables, where the first assignment is direct, and subsequent assignments depend on the values of previous variables.

Now, let's analyze the program:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
m = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2:
        m += 1
print(m if m <= 23 else -1)
```

### Breakdown of the Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the numbers to potentially allow a straightforward evaluation of the doubling condition.
3. **Variable Counting**: It initializes `m` to 1 and then iterates through the sorted list. For each element, it checks if the current element is not double the previous element. If it's not double, it increments `m`.
4. **Output**: Finally, it checks if `m` is less than or equal to 23. If it is, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1.

### Potential Issue:
The problem description states that for each value `a_t`, it must be possible to form it from the sum of previous variables. The current implementation does not accurately capture the conditions required to ensure that the sequence of operations can be performed.

**Counter Example**:
Consider the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
Expected output is `-1` because you cannot form the value `5` using the values `3` and `6` (which are the only distinct values we can create). However, the logic in the code would incorrectly count `5` as valid since it checks only whether `5` is double of `3`, which it is not, thus incrementing `m` incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning and the identified counterexample that demonstrates an invalid output for a valid input scenario, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
