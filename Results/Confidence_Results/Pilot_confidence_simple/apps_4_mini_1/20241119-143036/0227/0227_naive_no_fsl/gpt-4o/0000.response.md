Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem. 

### Issue:
The problem states that for each operation after the first, you must assign a variable `b_y` a value that is equal to the sum of values stored in two other variables `b_i` and `b_j`, and that this must match the corresponding value in sequence `a`. The code does not ensure that the values being added to form the next `a[t]` come from distinct operations or distinct variables.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:

```
4
1 2 3 5
```

1. According to the problem:
   - First operation: Assign `b_1 = 1`
   - Second operation: We need to create `b_y = 2` from two variables. The only variable we have is `b_1`, and we cannot obtain `2` from just `1`. Hence, the program should return `-1`.

However, the provided code would return `2`, because it attempts to assign `b_y` directly to `2` without checking if `1 + 1` produces `2` using the same variable. This is incorrect as per the problem requirements.

Thus, the program fails for this case, leading to a conclusion that it is incorrect.
