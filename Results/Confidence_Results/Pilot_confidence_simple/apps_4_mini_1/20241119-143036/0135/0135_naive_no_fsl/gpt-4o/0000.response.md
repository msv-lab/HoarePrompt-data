To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to check if the remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The expected output is "Yes" if all remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise. 

### Input Constraints:
- `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`

### Program Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - If `k >= n`, the program immediately returns `'No'`. This is correct because if `i` goes up to `n`, `n % n` will always be `0`, which means the remainders cannot all be distinct.
   
2. **Set for Tracking Remainders**:
   - The program uses a set `seen_remainders` to track the remainders observed during the loop from `1` to `k`.
   - For each `i`, it computes `n % i` and checks if this remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns `'No'`.

3. **Adding Remainders to Set**:
   - If the remainder is not in the set, it is added, and the loop continues.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If the loop completes without finding duplicate remainders, it returns `'Yes'`.

### Edge Case Analysis:
We need to consider if there are any edge cases where the program may not behave as expected:

- **Case of Large `n` and Small `k`**:
  - Let's consider `n = 10^18` and `k = 1`. 
    - The output should be "Yes" because there is only one remainder: `10^18 % 1` which is `0`. Since there is only one remainder, it is trivially distinct.
  
- **Case where `k < n`**:
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the remainders are:
    - `10 % 1 = 0`
    - `10 % 2 = 0`
    - `10 % 3 = 1`
    - `10 % 4 = 2`
    - `10 % 5 = 0`
  - Here, the program would return "No" because `0` is repeated.

- **Another edge case**:
  - For `k = 2` and `n = 2`, we have:
    - `2 % 1 = 0`
    - `2 % 2 = 0`
  - The program would return "No".

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the case where `k < n`, and the calculations may return duplicate remainders for certain values of `n` and `k`. 

Therefore, considering the logic of the program and the potential issue with cases where `1 ≤ k < n`, I find:

Correctness: **False**

### Reasons for Incorrectness:
The program does not handle the situation correctly when `k < n` and there are duplicate remainders within that range. An example where the program fails is `(n=10, k=5)`, where the output should be "No" but it may not correctly identify duplicates depending on the logic flow.
