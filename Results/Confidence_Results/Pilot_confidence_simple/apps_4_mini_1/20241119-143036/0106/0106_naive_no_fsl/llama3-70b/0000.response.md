To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases.

### Analysis of the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads values for `n` (number of blocks), `m` (number of floors), and `k` (number of apartments per floor). It then reads the apartment numbers `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks**:
   - The code calculates the floor of each apartment using the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1` and `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
   - It calculates the block of each apartment using `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Time**:
   - The program calculates the minimum time to move between blocks using `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. This handles movement in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
   - It calculates the time to move between floors, considering whether Edward needs to move up or down, and adds the elevator wait time.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total time.

### Potential Issues:
- The calculation for `a_block` and `b_block` is done using integer division with `(m * k)`. In the problem, `k` is the number of apartments per floor, and `m * k` gives the number of apartments per block. This seems correct, but one edge case arises when `n`, `m`, and `k` are minimal (i.e., when they are all equal to 1).
  
- Also, the program does not account for when both apartments `a` and `b` are on the same floor in different blocks. For example, if `a` is the last apartment in one block and `b` is the first apartment in the next block, it should be able to go directly to the other block without any floor movement.

### Test Case to Consider:
Let's consider the following input:
```
1 1 2
1 2
```
- Here, Edward is in apartment 1 of the only block, and Natasha is in apartment 2 of the same block. 
- Expected output should be `0` because they are on the same floor and in the same block, so Edward can reach Natasha instantly.
  
However, according to the program, the output would be calculated as:
- `a_block` and `b_block` would both be `1`.
- `min_block_time` would be `0` since they are in the same block.
- `a_floor` and `b_floor` would both be `1`, leading `min_floor_time` to result incorrectly due to the elevator time being added unnecessarily.

This leads to a failure case for the program because it should return `0` but may return a non-zero value due to the structure of the calculation.

### Conclusion:
Due to the failure to handle the case where both apartments are in the same block, and the incorrect calculation for minimal time in such scenarios, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
