Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to calculate the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday given `2^n` days in a year and `k` people. 

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Input Handling**: The program first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If it is, the output is `1 1`, which correctly represents that it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, as there are not enough days.

2. **Calculating Total Days**: The program calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`).

3. **Calculating Probability**:
   - The program iteratively calculates the numerator and the denominator of the probability fraction. 
   - It uses a loop to calculate the number of arrangements without sharing a birthday (`p_no_shared`).

4. **Shared Probability**: It calculates the probability of shared birthdays as `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.

5. **Reducing the Fraction**: The program includes a helper function `func_1` to compute the GCD of A and B, ensuring that the output values are coprime.

6. **Output Modulo**: The final values of A and B are printed modulo `10^6 + 3`, which is required by the problem description.

No edge cases or logical errors appear to be present in the code, and it adheres to the problem statement requirements. Additionally, it properly handles the condition when `k` exceeds the number of available days. 

Given that it works correctly for the provided examples and can handle the logical conditions specified in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
