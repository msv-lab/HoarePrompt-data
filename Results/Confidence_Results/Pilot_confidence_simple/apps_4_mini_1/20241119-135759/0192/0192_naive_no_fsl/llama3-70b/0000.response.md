Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem of transforming an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`. 

First, let's analyze the requirement: In one second, Memory can change one side of the triangle, but the triangle must maintain its property of being a non-degenerate triangle. This means that, at any point, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. 

The program simply calculates the difference between `x` and `y` and returns that value, which does not account for the multiple operations and the requirement for maintaining the non-degenerate condition throughout the process. 

For instance, consider the input `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The correct transformation requires a sequence of operations that maintains the triangle's integrity, which can take more than just the absolute difference in lengths. 

To demonstrate this, let's consider a specific case:
- For `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the correct sequence is:
  1. Start with (6, 6, 6)
  2. Change one side to 3: (6, 6, 3) → valid
  3. Change another side to 4: (6, 4, 3) → valid
  4. Finally change the last side to 3: (3, 4, 3) → valid
  5. Transform to (3, 3, 3) → final valid state

The correct number of steps here is 4 seconds. However, the program would incorrectly output `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which misses the necessary step to reach the final state.

Thus, the program fails to reflect the true nature of the operations needed, resulting in incorrect outputs for various cases.
