To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the operations Memory can perform and the program's logic.

1. **Understanding the problem:** 
   - Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to reduce it to a side length `y`.
   - The triangle must always remain non-degenerate, meaning that the lengths of the sides must always be positive integers and must satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.

2. **Operations allowed:**
   - In one second, Memory can modify one side of the triangle. The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds required.

3. **Program logic:**
   ```python
   (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
   print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
   ```
   - The program calculates the number of seconds by computing:
     - `(x - y) // 2`: This gives the number of complete two-unit reductions.
     - `(x - y) % 2`: This accounts for an additional reduction if `x - y` is odd.

4. **Potential cases for correctness:**
   - The program assumes that it can make adjustments to the side lengths to meet the target `y`. However, it does not validate the non-degenerate triangle condition adequately.
   - If `x` is significantly greater than `y`, the program might suggest a sequence of operations that brings a side length down too quickly, possibly resulting in a configuration that violates the triangle inequality.

5. **Test cases:**
   - For the input `(8, 5)`, the program outputs `3`, which, upon examination, can form a valid sequence:
     - `(8, 8, 8) → (8, 8, 5) → (8, 5, 5) → (5, 5, 5)`.
   - For the input `(22, 4)`, the program outputs `6`. A valid sequence is:
     - `(22, 22, 22) → (22, 22, 16) → (22, 10, 16) → (7, 10, 16) → (7, 4, 4) → (4, 4, 4)`.
   - Now consider the input `(5, 3)`. The output would be `1`, suggesting:
     - `(5, 5, 5) → (3, 5, 5)`, which is invalid since `(3, 5, 5)` is a degenerate triangle (it can form a triangle, but the reduction from 5 to 3 is not valid in one second).

6. **Conclusion:**
   The provided program does not adequately handle the necessary checks to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate at every step. Therefore, it can fail in specific cases where the triangle inequality is not satisfied during the reduction process.

Correctness: **False**
