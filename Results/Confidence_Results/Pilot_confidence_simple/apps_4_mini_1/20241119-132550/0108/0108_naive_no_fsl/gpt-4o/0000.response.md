Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description. While the program checks if the input string can contain the entire English alphabet as a subsequence, it does not account for the possibility of replacing characters in the input string to achieve this. 

For example, consider the input string "abcdefghijklmnoz". The characters 'a' to 'n' are already present and can be used directly, but to complete the sequence, we need 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'. The program outputs "-1" because it does not check if it is possible to modify the existing characters to obtain the necessary letters to form the complete alphabet as a subsequence.

If we adjust 'z' to 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', we can see that it is indeed possible to create "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". Hence, the program fails to produce the correct output for this case, indicating that it does not handle all potential cases correctly. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the problem requirements fully.
