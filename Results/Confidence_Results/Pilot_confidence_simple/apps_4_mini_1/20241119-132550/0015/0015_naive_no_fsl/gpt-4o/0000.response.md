Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle certain edge cases. For example, when `c` is negative and `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` will always be `False` since the division by a negative number will yield a negative result. 

Consider the case:
Input:
```
5 10 -2
```
In this scenario, the sequence generated would be `5, 3, 1, -1, -3, ...` which will not contain `10`. However, the program will output 'NO', which is correct, but it fails in case where `b` is less than `a` but still reachable by going in the negative direction.

Another case to consider is when:
Input:
```
10 10 -1
```
The output for this should be 'YES' as `b` is equal to `a`, and it correctly prints 'YES'. The existing checks fail to comprehensively establish whether `b` can be reached based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Thus, the program cannot guarantee correctness for all edge cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
