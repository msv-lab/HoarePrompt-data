Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to check if Vasya's favorite number \( b \) appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element \( a \) and the common difference \( c \). Let's analyze the cases:

1. **When \( c = 0 \)**:
   - The sequence consists of repeated values equal to \( a \). The program checks if \( a \) equals \( b \). If they are equal, it outputs "YES" (which is correct); otherwise, it outputs "NO".

2. **When \( c \neq 0 \)**:
   - The program computes whether the difference \( b - a \) is divisible by \( c \) and checks if the result of the division \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative. This ensures that \( b \) can be reached from \( a \) through the sequence generated by \( c \).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it outputs "YES", indicating that \( b \) can be part of the sequence; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

The program correctly handles all edge cases defined in the problem description, including:
- Cases where \( c = 0 \).
- Cases where \( a \) is equal to \( b \).
- Cases where \( b \) is less than \( a \) with positive \( c \).
- Cases where \( b \) is unreachable due to the common difference.

Since all potential situations have been accounted for, the program behaves as expected for all input values within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct.

Thus, the final judgment is:

Correctness: **True**
