Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by finding their positions in the array and considering the distance between them. It also handles the edge case when the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring correctness.
