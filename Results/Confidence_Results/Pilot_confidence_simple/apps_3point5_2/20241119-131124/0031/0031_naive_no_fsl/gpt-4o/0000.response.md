Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday in Udayland given the number of days in a year and the number of people being interviewed. It uses the formula provided in the problem description and handles large numbers by using modulo arithmetic. The program also reduces the fraction to its irreducible form as required. The program iterates through the number of people being interviewed and calculates the numerator and denominator accordingly. The final output is the irreducible fraction A/B modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description and the provided examples, so the program is correct.
