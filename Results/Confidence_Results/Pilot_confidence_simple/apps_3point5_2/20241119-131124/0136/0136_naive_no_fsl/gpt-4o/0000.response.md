Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very large integers as input.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both integers.
3. It then compares the lengths of the integers, and if they are not equal, it prints '<' if the first integer is shorter and '>' if the second integer is shorter.
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the integers as strings and prints '<' if the first integer is less, '>' if the second integer is less, and '=' if they are equal.
5. The program handles the case where the integers are equal and also handles the case where one or both of the integers are zero.
6. The program handles the input format specified in the problem description.
7. The logic of the program is correct for all potential cases, as it correctly determines which integer is greater, less, or equal.
