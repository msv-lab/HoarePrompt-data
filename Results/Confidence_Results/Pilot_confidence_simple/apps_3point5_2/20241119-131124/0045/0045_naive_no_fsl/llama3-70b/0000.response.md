Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an input of two integers n and k, then it calculates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n. It then outputs the sequence. The program correctly handles the case where n < k by outputting -1. It also generates a sequence that is strictly increasing and its sum is equal to n. The greatest common divisor is not explicitly calculated, but since the sequence is strictly increasing, the greatest common divisor is essentially 1 for all elements. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
