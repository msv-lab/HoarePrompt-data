Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, calculates the balance of the given string, and then determines the number of prefixes with the desired balance as per the problem description. The logic used in the program covers all cases as described in the problem statement. The program calculates the number of prefixes or outputs -1 if there is an infinite number of prefixes, which aligns with the requirements of the problem. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input examples.
