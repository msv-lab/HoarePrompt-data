Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all remainders of n divided by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It correctly handles the case where k is greater than or equal to n, and it uses a set to keep track of seen remainders to check for duplicates. The program returns "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise. The examples provided also give the correct output based on the problem description. Hence, the code is correct for all potential cases.
