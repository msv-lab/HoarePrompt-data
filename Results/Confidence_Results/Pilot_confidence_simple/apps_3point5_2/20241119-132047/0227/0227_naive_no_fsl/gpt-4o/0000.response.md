Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program does not implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of variables m that can help perform the described sequence of operations. The program is simply counting the number of unique elements in the input sequence, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

An example where the program fails to provide the correct output:
Input:
3
3 6 5

Expected Output:
-1

Explanation:
In this case, it is not possible to perform the described sequence of operations with any number of variables, so the correct output should be -1. However, the program will output 3 as it counts the unique elements in the input sequence.
