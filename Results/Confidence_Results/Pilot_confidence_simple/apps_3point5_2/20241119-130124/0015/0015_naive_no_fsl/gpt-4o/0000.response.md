Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence (b == a), the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c == 0), the program correctly outputs 'NO'.
3. If the difference between Vasya's favorite number and the first element of the sequence is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements and the result is non-negative ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0), the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
4. In all other cases, the program correctly outputs 'NO'.
