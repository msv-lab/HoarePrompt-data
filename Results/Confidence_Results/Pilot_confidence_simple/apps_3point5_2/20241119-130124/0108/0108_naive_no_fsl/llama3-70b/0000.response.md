Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input string `s` and iterates over each character in the English alphabet. For each character, it checks if it exists in the input string `s`, and if so, it appends it to the result string `res` and replaces that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet. 
If the length of the result string is equal to 26 (length of the English alphabet), it prints the result string. Otherwise, it prints -1.
The logic of the code correctly follows the problem description and ensures that the final result contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The code handles all characters in the input string and ensures that the final result is either the full alphabet or -1 if it is not possible to achieve.
