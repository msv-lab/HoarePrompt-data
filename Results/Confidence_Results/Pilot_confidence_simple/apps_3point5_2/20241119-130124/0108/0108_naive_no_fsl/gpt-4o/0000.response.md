Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly takes an input string and iterates through it to find if it can form the English alphabet as a subsequence. It does so by checking if the characters in the input string match the target alphabet sequence. If all characters are found in order, it prints the target alphabet sequence. If not, it prints -1. The logic provided in the program is correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
