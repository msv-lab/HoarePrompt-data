Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it may not always produce the smallest possible integer n. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` does not ensure that the generated numbers are the smallest possible.

For example, consider the input:
```
199966633300
63
```
The expected output according to the problem description is `3036366999`, but the program may not always produce this smallest integer.
