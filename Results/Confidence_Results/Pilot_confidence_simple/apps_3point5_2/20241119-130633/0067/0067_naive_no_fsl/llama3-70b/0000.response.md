The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases:
1. If there are more upvotes than downvotes and unknown votes, it prints '+'
2. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, it prints '-'
3. If the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes and there are no unknown votes, it prints '0'
4. If the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes and there are unknown votes, it prints '?' to indicate uncertainty

The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
