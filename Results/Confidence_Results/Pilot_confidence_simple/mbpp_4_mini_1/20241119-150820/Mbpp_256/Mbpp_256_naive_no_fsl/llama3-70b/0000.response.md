Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n: int) -> int` accepts a non-negative integer `n`.

2. **Prime Check**: The nested function `is_prime(num: int) -> bool` correctly determines if a number is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility for numbers 2 and above.

3. **Counting Primes**: The main loop iterates through all numbers from 2 to `n-1`. For each number, it checks if it is prime using `is_prime(num)` and increments the `count` accordingly.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the count of prime numbers found.

Edge Cases Considered:
- If `n` is 0 or 1, the function correctly returns 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 0 or 1.
- For `n = 2`, the function also correctly returns 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 2.

No examples can be found where the program fails to satisfy the requirement stated in the problem description, indicating that it handles all potential cases as expected.
