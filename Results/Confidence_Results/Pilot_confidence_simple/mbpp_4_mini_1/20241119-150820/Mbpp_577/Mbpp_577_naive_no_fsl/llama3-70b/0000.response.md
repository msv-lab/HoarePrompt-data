Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the last digit of the factorial for all integers. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 5`. The factorial of 5 is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program returns `0` for any `n >= 5`, not specifically for `n = 5`. 

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle cases for numbers greater than 4. Here are some specific cases:
- For `n = 0`, it should return `1` (as `0! = 1`).
- For `n = 1`, it should also return `1` (as `1! = 1`).
- For `n = 5`, it should return `0` (as `5! = 120`).
- For `n = 6`, it should still return `0` (as `6! = 720`).
- For any `n >= 5`, the last digit of the factorial is always `0`.

The logic in the program is incomplete and does not cover all necessary cases to determine the last digit of the factorial, which leads to incorrect outputs for various inputs.
