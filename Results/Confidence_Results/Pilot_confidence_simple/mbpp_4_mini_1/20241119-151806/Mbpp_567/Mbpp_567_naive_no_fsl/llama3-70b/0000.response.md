Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It uses a generator expression inside the `all()` function to compare each element with the next one in the list. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the function:

1. `range(len(lst) - 1)` generates indices from `0` to `len(lst) - 2`, allowing comparisons between `lst[i]` and `lst[i + 1]`.
2. The comparison `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]` ensures that each element is less than or equal to the next element.
3. `all()` returns `True` only if all comparisons are `True`, which means the list is sorted. If there are any comparisons that return `False`, it will return `False`.

The function handles various edge cases:
- An empty list will return `True`, as it is considered sorted.
- A list with a single element will also return `True`, as there are no elements to compare.
- A list that is sorted in non-decreasing order will return `True`.
- A list that is not sorted will return `False`.

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.
