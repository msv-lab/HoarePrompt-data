Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check if a given tuple contains any `None` value. However, the function `func_1(tup)` returns `True` if there is at least one `None` value in the tuple. This means it indicates the presence of `None` values instead of checking for their absence.

For example:
- `func_1((1, 2, None))` returns `True`, which is correct in indicating that there is a `None` value present.
- `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `False`, which is correct in indicating that there are no `None` values present.

However, the problem description does not specify what the function should return when it finds a `None` value. If we interpret the problem to mean that it should return `True` if there are no `None` values and `False` if there is at least one `None` value, then the implementation is incorrect.

Accordingly, since the function's behavior does not clearly meet the implicit requirements of checking for the presence of `None` values as per the description, it can be considered incorrect based on the ambiguity in the problem description regarding expected output. 

Thus, the current implementation fails to satisfy the requirements as it does not provide an expected output that is defined by the problem description.
