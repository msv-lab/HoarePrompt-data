Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists and then constructs two new lists, one containing the first element of each sublist and the other containing the second element of each sublist. The program then returns these two lists as a list of two lists.

The program is tested with three different cases:
1. `func_1([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']])` - This case tests the function with string elements in the sublists. The expected output is `[['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]`, which correctly extracts the first and second elements from each sublist.
2. `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])` - This case tests the function with integer elements in the sublists. The expected output is `[[1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]]`, which correctly extracts the first and second elements from each sublist.
3. `func_1([[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]], [[5], [6]], [[7], [8]]])` - This case tests the function with sublists containing lists as elements. The expected output is `[[[1], [3], [5], [7]], [[2], [4], [6], [8]]]`, which correctly extracts the first and second elements from each sublist.

Overall, the program works as expected for all the given test cases and follows the problem description, hence the correctness is **True**.
