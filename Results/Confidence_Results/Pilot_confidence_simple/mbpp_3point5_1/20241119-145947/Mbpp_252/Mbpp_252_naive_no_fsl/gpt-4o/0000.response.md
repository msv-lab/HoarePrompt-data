Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts the given complex numbers to polar coordinates for all the test cases. The `cmath.polar()` function returns the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number, which is then returned by the `func_1` function. The output for all the test cases matches the expected polar coordinates, so the program is correct.
