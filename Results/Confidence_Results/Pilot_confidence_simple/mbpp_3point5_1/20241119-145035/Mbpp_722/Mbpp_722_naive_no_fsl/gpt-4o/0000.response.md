Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program defines a function that takes in a dictionary of student names as keys and tuples of student height and weight as values, along with minimal height and minimal weight. It then filters the students based on the condition that both their height and weight are above the respective minimum values.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. Test case with min_height = 6.0 and min_weight = 70: Only 'Cierra Vega' satisfies both conditions and is returned.
2. Test case with min_height = 5.9 and min_weight = 67: Both 'Cierra Vega' and 'Kierra Gentry' satisfy the conditions and are returned.
3. Test case with min_height = 5.7 and min_weight = 64: All students meet the conditions and are returned.

The program logic is correct as it filters out students based on the given criteria for height and weight. The test cases cover various scenarios, and the program produces the expected output in each case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.
