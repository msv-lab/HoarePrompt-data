Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the list is not sorted in ascending order. For example, for the input [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17], the program should return False but it returns True. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
