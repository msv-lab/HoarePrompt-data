Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `find()` and the index of the last occurrence using `rfind()`. Then it removes the character between the first and last occurrence indexes using string slicing. If the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string. The program covers all potential cases as per the problem description and works correctly for all scenarios.
