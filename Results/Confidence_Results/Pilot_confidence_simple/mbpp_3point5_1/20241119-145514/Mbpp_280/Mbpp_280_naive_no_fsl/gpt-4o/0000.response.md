Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` iterates through the input array and checks if the given element is equal to the current value in the array. If a match is found, it returns a tuple with True indicating that the element is in the array and the index position of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with False indicating that the element is not in the array and -1 as the index position. 
The provided test cases cover scenarios where the element is present in different positions within the array, and the function returns the correct tuple with the expected values. Therefore, the program is correct.
