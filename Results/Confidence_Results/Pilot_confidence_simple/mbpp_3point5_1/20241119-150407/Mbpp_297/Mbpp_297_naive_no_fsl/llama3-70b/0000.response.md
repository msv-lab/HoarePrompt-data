Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively checking each element in the list. It handles the case where an element in the list is another nested list by calling the function recursively on that element. The function appends non-list elements to the `flat_list` and returns the flattened list at the end. I couldn't think of any case where this program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
