Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that correctly returns the symmetric difference (difference between two lists) by using the XOR operator (^) on sets created from the input lists. The program then sorts the resulting list to match the expected output. The logic is correct and will work for all potential cases as it accurately implements the description of getting the difference between two lists.
