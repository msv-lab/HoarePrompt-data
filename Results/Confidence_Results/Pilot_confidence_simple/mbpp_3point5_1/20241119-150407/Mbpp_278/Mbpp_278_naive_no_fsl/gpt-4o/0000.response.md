Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the elements of the tuple and counts the number of elements before a tuple element is encountered. It breaks out of the loop as soon as a tuple element is found. The assertions provided in the program match the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
