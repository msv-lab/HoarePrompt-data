Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program takes the input values of x and y, then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y based on the given formula. The logic of the program is correct as it correctly calculates the number of operations needed to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y. The program handles all potential cases as per the problem description, ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate at all times. The examples provided in the problem description also match the output of the program, indicating its correctness.
