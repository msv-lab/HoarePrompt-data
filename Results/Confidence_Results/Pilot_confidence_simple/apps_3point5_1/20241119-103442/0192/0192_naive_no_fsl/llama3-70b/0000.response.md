Correctness: False

The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input values (x and y) and prints it as the output. However, this does not follow the problem description as it does not consider the requirement that the length of each side should be an integer at any moment of time. 

For example, if we take the input (8, 5), the program will output 3 which is incorrect. The correct minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length 5 from side length 8 is 2, not 3.
