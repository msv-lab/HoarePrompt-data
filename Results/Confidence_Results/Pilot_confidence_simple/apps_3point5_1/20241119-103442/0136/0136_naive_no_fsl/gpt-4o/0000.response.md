Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers as input.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both integers.
3. It then compares the length of the two integers. If the lengths are different, it directly prints the result based on the length.
4. If the lengths are the same, it compares the actual values of the integers and prints the result accordingly.
5. The program correctly handles the cases where a < b, a > b, and a = b as specified in the problem description.
6. The program logic covers all potential cases and correctly determines which number is greater or if they are equal.
