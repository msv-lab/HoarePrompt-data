Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It uses the formula for calculating the probability and reduces the fraction to its irreducible form. The program also takes care of large numbers by using modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic seems sound and there are no apparent issues with the implementation.
