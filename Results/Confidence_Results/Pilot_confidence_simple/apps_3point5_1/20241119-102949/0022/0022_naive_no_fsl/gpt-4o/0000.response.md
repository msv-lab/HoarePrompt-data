Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if a given string is a "s-palindrome" by iterating through the string and comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string. If at any point the characters do not match, it returns False indicating that the string is not a "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns True. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` aligns with the problem description provided, and the program handles all potential cases where a string is not symmetric about the middle.
