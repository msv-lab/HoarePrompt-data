Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the given string $s$ and then determines the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$ based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The logic used in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem, and it handles cases where there might be an infinite number of prefixes appropriately. 

All the provided test cases are correctly evaluated by the program, and there are no potential cases identified where the program deviates from the problem description. Therefore, the program can be considered correct.
