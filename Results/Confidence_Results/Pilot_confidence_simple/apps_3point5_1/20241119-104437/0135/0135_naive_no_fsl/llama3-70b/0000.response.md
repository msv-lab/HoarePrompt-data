Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. If a remainder is already in the set, it prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues. The program then prints "Yes" if all remainders are distinct. The logic of the program matches the problem description and handles all potential cases.
