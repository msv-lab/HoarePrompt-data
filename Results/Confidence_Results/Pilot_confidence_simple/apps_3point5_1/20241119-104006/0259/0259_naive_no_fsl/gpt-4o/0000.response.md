Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the input time and the interval between buses.
3. The function then determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time, as required by the problem description.
4. The program outputs the chosen route correctly.
5. The logic in the program adheres to the problem description and handles all potential cases outlined in the problem statement.
6. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem.
