Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap. It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array, calculates the maximum and minimum distances between them, and then outputs the maximum of those distances. The logic provided in the code covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
