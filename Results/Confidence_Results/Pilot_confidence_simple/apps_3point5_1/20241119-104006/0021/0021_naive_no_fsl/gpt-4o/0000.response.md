Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculating the maximum distance between them. It then outputs the maximum possible distance after performing exactly one swap. The logic of the program seems correct and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
