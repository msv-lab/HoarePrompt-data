Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in A and then finds the divisors of the sum of A. It then iterates through the divisors and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element of A after the operations. If a divisor is found that satisfies the condition, it is printed as the output.

The program handles all potential cases by iterating through the divisors of the sum of A and checking if each divisor satisfies the condition for every element in A. Since the program considers all possible divisors and checks them against all elements in A, it covers all scenarios and provides the correct output.
