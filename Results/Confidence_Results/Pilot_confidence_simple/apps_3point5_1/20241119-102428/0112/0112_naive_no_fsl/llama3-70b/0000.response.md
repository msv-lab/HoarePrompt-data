Correctness: False

The given program does not handle the case where Masha cannot make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes. In such a scenario, the program should output 0 as mentioned in the problem description. However, the program does not check for this condition. 

For example, if the input is:
```
1
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output should be 0 since Masha cannot make any integers from 1 to x using just one cube. But the program will output 543210, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
