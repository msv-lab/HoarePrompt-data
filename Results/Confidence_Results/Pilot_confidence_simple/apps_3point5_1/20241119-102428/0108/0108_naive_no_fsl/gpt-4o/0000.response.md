Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string and the target string to check if the characters match in order to form the English alphabet as a subsequence. If the characters match, it increments the index in the target string, and if at the end of the iteration the target string index reaches the end, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
