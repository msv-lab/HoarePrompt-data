Correctness: **False**

The problem description specifies that the goal is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program only retains uppercase characters in the string and removes all lowercase characters. This does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings, as it implies that entire sequences of lowercase letters should be removed rather than just individual characters. 

For example, if we take the input string "helloWorld", the expected behavior would be to remove the lowercase substring "hello", resulting in "World". However, the function will return "W", which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not work as expected for this potential case.
