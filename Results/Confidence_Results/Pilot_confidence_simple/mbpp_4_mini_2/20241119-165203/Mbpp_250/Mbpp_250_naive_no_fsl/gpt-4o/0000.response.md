Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple and an element, and returns the count of occurrences of the element in the tuple using the `count` method of the tuple, which is the appropriate way to count elements in Python.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves as expected for several test cases:
1. For the element `4`, which does not appear in the tuple, the function correctly returns `0`.
2. For the element `10`, which appears `3` times in the tuple, the function correctly returns `3`.
3. For the element `8`, which appears `4` times in the tuple, the function correctly returns `4`.

Since the function handles these cases accurately and there are no edge cases missed in the implementation, the program is deemed correct.
