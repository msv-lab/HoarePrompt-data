To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

**Problem description:** The goal is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

**Program:** 
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **String Expansion:** The program expands the binary string `s` by repeating it enough times to ensure it can accommodate `n` rotations. This means that if `s` is shorter than `n`, it will be artificially extended.

2. **Counting Odd Values:** The loop iterates `n` times, where in each iteration it takes a substring `temp` of length `len(s)` starting from index `i`. The program then counts how many '1's are present in `temp` and checks if that count is odd by using the modulus operation.

3. **Final Count:** It accumulates how many times the count of '1's in `temp` is odd, returning this count at the end.

### Potential Cases to Evaluate:
- **Case 1:** When `s` is an empty string and `n` is greater than 0. This should return 0 because there are no '1's to count, but the program will enter the loop and potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
  
- **Case 2:** When `s` contains only '0's (e.g., "0000") and `n` is greater than 0. The function should return 0 since there are no '1's, but it will still count for `n` iterations with no odd counts.

- **Case 3:** When `n` is less than the length of `s`, the program still tries to count over `n` iterations. If `s` is longer and `n` is smaller, the logic still works, but this is less of a concern given the expansion.

- **Case 4:** If `n` is negative, it is not clear how the program should behave since the logic does not account for it. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `s` is empty or when `n` is negative. For instance, calling `func_1("", 3)` might raise an exception or yield incorrect results.

**Correctness: False** 

The program fails to account for edge cases such as empty strings or negative rotations.
