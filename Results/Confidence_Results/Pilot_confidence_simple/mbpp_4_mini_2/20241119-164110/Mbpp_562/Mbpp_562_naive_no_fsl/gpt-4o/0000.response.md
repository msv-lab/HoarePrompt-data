Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the length of the longest sublist within a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist, checks its length, and updates the maximum length found. The function handles various cases, such as empty sublists and varying lengths, effectively returning the expected maximum length in the provided assertions.

Since all assertions provided in the program are correct and demonstrate that the function works as intended for the described problem, and I cannot think of any additional edge cases that would cause it to fail, I conclude that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
