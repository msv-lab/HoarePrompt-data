Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the character `c` occurs only once in the input string `s`. According to the problem description, if there is only one occurrence of the character, the program should remove that single occurrence. However, the current implementation does not remove it because the condition `if first_occ != -1 and last_occ != -1` evaluates to `True` only if the character occurs at least twice. 

For example:
- Input: `func_1("hello", "o")` (where the character 'o' occurs once)
- Expected Output: `"hell"` (removing the single occurrence of 'o')
- Actual Output: `"hello"` (as the program does not remove a single occurrence)

Thus, the program fails in this case, which demonstrates that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
