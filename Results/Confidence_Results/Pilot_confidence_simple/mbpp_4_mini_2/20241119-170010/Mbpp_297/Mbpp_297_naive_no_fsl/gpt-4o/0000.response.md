Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the input list, and if an item is a list, it calls itself on that item to further flatten it. If an item is not a list, it is appended directly to the `flat_list`. 

The assertions provided in the code show that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Additionally, since the function is designed to handle any level of nesting, it will continue to work correctly for other test cases that could include varying depths of nested lists or even empty lists. 

For example:
- An input of `func_1([])` would return `[]`, which is the expected result for an empty list.
- An input of `func_1([[[]]])` would return `[]`, correctly handling multiple levels of empty lists.

Since I cannot find any input to the function that would break the expected behavior, the implementation is indeed correct.
