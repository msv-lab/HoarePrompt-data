Correctness: **False**

The provided program claims to get the difference between two lists using the symmetric difference operation (`^`) which returns elements that are in either of the lists but not in both. However, the problem description specifically asks for the difference between two lists, which is generally understood to mean the elements that are in the first list but not in the second (list1 - list2).

For example:
- If `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 3, 4]`, the expected difference (elements in `list1` not in `list2`) should be `[1]`. However, the code will return `[1, 4]`, which is incorrect.

This discrepancy indicates that the provided solution does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
