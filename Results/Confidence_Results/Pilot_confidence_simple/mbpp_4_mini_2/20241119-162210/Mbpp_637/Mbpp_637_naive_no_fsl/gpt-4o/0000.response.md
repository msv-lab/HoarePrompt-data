Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price, which directly addresses the problem description of checking whether there is no profit and no loss. 

Let's analyze the assertions provided in the program:

1. `assert func_1(1500, 1200) == False`: This correctly identifies that the selling price is less than the cost price, indicating a loss.
2. `assert func_1(100, 100) == True`: This correctly identifies that the selling price equals the cost price, indicating no profit and no loss.
3. `assert func_1(2000, 5000) == False`: This correctly identifies that the selling price exceeds the cost price, indicating a profit.

Since all assertions align with the expected behavior described in the problem description, and there appear to be no edge cases that would cause the function to give incorrect results, the program behaves as required. Thus, the program is correct.
