To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its implementation against the problem description: "Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number."

### Analysis of the Program:
The function `func_1(n)` is designed to return the last digit of the factorial of `n`. Here are the key points:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n < 2`, it returns `n` (which is correct for `0!` and `1!` since both are `1`).
   - For `n = 2`, it returns `2` (which is correct since `2! = 2`).
   - For `n = 3`, it returns `3` (which is also correct since `3! = 6`, and the last digit is `6`, but the function returns `3`, which is incorrect).
   - For `n = 4`, it returns `4` (this is incorrect since `4! = 24`, and the last digit is `4`).

2. **General Case**:
   - For any `n >= 5`, it returns `0`. This is incorrect because the last digit of factorials for `n >= 5` is always `0` (since `5!` includes a multiplication by `10`), but it does not handle the specific last digits for `n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 3`, the expected output should be `6`, but the program returns `3`.
- For `n = 5`, the expected output should be `0`, which the program correctly returns, but the reasoning for outputs for `n = 6, 7, 8, 9` is not explicitly handled.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it fails to return the correct last digit for several values, such as `3` and does not adequately handle the last digits for numbers greater than `4`.

Thus, the function does not meet the problem's requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
