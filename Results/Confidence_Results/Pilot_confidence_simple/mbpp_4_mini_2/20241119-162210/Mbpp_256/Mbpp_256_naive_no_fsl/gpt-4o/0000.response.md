To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function is supposed to return the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number.

Here is a breakdown of the program logic:

1. It checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it immediately returns 0, which is correct since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
2. It initializes a list `is_prime` of size `n`, where each index represents whether that index is a prime number (True) or not (False). The first two indices (0 and 1) are set to False since neither 0 nor 1 is prime.
3. The program then implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:
   - It iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `n`.
   - For each prime number found, it marks its multiples as non-prime.
4. Finally, it sums the values in `is_prime` to count the number of True values, which represent the prime numbers less than `n`.

Now, we need to examine if there are any edge cases or inputs that the program does not handle correctly:

- For `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the function correctly returns 0 since there are no prime numbers less than these values.
- For `n = 2`, it also correctly returns 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
- For `n = 3`, it should return 1 (the prime number 2), which the program handles correctly.
- For `n = 4`, it should return 2 (the prime numbers 2 and 3), which the program handles correctly.
- For larger values of `n`, the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm efficiently counts the primes.

After reviewing the implementation with these edge cases, it appears that the program handles all possible inputs as specified in the problem description. 

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
