Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input, and it concatenates the two by first converting the tuple to a list and then appending it to the original list. 

Hereâ€™s why the code is correct:
- The function will correctly handle both an empty list and an empty tuple. For example, `func_1([], ())` will return `[]`, which is the expected behavior.
- It will also work when the list or tuple contains various data types, such as integers, strings, or other lists. For example, `func_1([1, 2], (3, 4))` will return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, as expected.
- Edge cases like a non-empty list combined with an empty tuple will also yield correct results, such as `func_1([1, 2], ())` returning `[1, 2]`.

Overall, there are no scenarios where the function does not meet the problem description, so the conclusion is that the function behaves correctly.
