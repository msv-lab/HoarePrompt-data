Correctness: **False**

The given program is supposed to check whether all the characters in the input string are the same. However, it fails for the case of an empty string. According to the problem description, it is ambiguous regarding how to handle an empty string, but conventionally, one might argue that since there are no characters, the answer should be `True`. 

In the code, the function returns `True` for an empty string, which could be seen as correct, but the inconsistency arises from the assertions. The assertion `assert func_1('python') == False` is incorrect because the string 'python' does not have all the same characters and should return `False`. However, the assertion for checking an empty string is not defined in the assertions, which leads to a lack of clarity on how to handle it.

Thus, the program does not strictly follow the problem description in every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
