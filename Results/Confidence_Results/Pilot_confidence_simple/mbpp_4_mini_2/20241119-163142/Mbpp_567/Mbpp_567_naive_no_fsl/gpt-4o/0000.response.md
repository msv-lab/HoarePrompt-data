Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function that checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here's how it works:
- The function `func_1(lst)` iterates through the list `lst` from the first element to the second-to-last element.
- For each element, it compares it with the next element. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the next (i.e., `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
- If the loop completes without finding any unsorted pairs, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The assertions provided in the code confirm that:
- The list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` is sorted, and thus the function returns `True`.
- The list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` is not sorted because `20 > 17`, so the function returns `False`.
- The list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` is also not sorted because `15 > 14`, resulting in `False`.

The program accurately handles different sorted and unsorted cases, including edge cases like strictly decreasing lists or lists with duplicate numbers. Since no potential case has been identified where the program fails to meet the described functionality, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
