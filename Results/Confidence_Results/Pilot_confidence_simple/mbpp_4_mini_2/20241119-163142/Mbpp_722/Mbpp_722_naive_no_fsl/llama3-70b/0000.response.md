Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that correctly filters students based on their height and weight according to the provided minimum values. The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the `student_data` dictionary and includes only those students whose height and weight are both greater than or equal to the specified minimums.

To verify correctness, let's consider some example scenarios:

1. If `student_data = {'Alice': (1.7, 60), 'Bob': (1.5, 50)}` and `min_height = 1.6` and `min_weight = 55`, the function would return `{'Alice': (1.7, 60)}`. This is correct because Alice meets both conditions while Bob does not.

2. If `student_data = {'Charlie': (1.8, 90), 'Dave': (1.7, 80)}` with `min_height = 1.6` and `min_weight = 70`, the function would return `{'Charlie': (1.8, 90), 'Dave': (1.7, 80)}`, which is also correct since both Charlie and Dave meet the minimum requirements.

3. If `student_data` contains no students, for instance, `student_data = {}` and given any `min_height` and `min_weight`, the function will return an empty dictionary `{}`, which is the expected behavior.

4. If all students fail to meet the criteria (for example, if `student_data = {'Eve': (1.5, 50)}` with `min_height = 1.6` and `min_weight = 55`), the function will return an empty dictionary `{}`, which is again the expected outcome.

Since all potential edge cases and typical scenarios confirm that the function behaves as specified, the program is correct.
