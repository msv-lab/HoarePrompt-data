Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks if there are any `None` values in the given tuple. However, the problem description states to check if the given tuple has any `none` value or not. In Python, `None` is case-sensitive, and `none` (lowercase) is not defined in the language. 

Thus, if the tuple contains the string `'none'` (in lowercase), the program incorrectly does not identify it as a `None` value. For instance:

```python
tup = ('none', 1, 2)
```

In this case, the return value of `func_1(tup)` would be `False`, but according to the problem description, the function should check for "none" values, which implies it should account for both `None` and the string `'none'`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
