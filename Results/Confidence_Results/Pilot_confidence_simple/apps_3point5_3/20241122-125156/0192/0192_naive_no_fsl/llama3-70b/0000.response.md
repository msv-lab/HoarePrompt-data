Correctness: False

The given program simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting side length x and the ending side length y. However, the problem description states that in a single second, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle. This means that the side length can only be modified by integers. 

The program does not take into account the fact that each side length should be an integer and that the triangle should remain non-degenerate throughout the process. 

For example, for the input (22, 4), the expected output is 6. However, the given program will output 18, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
