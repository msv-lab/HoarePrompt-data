Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program first defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, where `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland.
2. The program then reads input values for `n` and `k`, calls `func_2` with these values, and prints the output in the required format.
3. The logic inside `func_2` correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday in Udayland based on the input parameters `n` and `k`, and returns the values of A and B as required.
4. The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement, including the case where k > 2^n, and correctly calculates and prints the probability values modulo 10^6 + 3.
5. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and therefore can be considered correct.
