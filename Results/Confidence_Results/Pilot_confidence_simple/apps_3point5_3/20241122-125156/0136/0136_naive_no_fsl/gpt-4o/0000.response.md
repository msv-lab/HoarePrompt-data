Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads two very long integers as input and compares them as described in the problem statement. It handles cases where the input integers may contain leading zeroes by stripping them before comparison. The program then correctly determines if the first integer is less than, greater than, or equal to the second integer and prints the corresponding symbol. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
