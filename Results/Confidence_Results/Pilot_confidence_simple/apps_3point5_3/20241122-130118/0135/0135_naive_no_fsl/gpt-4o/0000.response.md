Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all remainders modulo i for 1 ≤ i ≤ k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found. The logic seems sound and covers all possible cases. The program also handles the case when k is greater than or equal to n, where it directly returns 'No'. Overall, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
