Correctness: **True**

I have reviewed the code and the problem description, and I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected. The code generates possible numbers based on the given substring and the total length of the string, and then finds the smallest number from those possibilities. The logic seems to be correctly implemented and should work for all cases. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
