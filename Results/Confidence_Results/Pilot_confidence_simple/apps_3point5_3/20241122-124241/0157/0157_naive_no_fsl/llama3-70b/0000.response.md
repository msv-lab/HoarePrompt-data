Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote by finding the minimum of lemons, apples divided by 2, and pears divided by 4. This ensures that the ratio of fruits in the compote is maintained as 1:2:4. The calculation of the total number of fruits is also correct as it sums up the minimum number of each fruit multiplied by their respective ratio in the compote. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided in the problem description where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
