Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the given problem description. It calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits and prints the result modulo $998244353$. The `count` function handles the counting of numbers with at most $k$ different digits efficiently. The main function calculates the result by subtracting the count of numbers less than $l$ with at most $k$ different digits from the count of numbers less than or equal to $r$ with at most $k$ different digits, and returns the result modulo $998244353`. The program takes input correctly and produces the expected output. Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
