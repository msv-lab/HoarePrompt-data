Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input string can be transformed into the target alphabet as a subsequence. For example, consider the input:
```
abcdef
```
The program will output -1, even though it is possible to transform the input string into the target alphabet as a subsequence by incrementing each character by one.
