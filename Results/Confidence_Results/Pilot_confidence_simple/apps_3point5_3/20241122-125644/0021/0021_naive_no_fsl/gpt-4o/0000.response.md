Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided. It calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, then calculates the distances between these elements and the beginning and end of the array. Finally, it finds the maximum distance possible and prints it, which is the expected output according to the problem statement. The code handles all potential cases where a swap can maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements.
