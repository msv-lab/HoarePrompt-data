Correctness: True

I have thoroughly reviewed the provided Python program and I believe it correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. The logic used to find the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, as well as calculating the distances and determining the maximum possible distance, seems to be accurate and aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the program and the problem description, I am confident that the code is correct and produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
