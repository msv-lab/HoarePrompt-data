Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where there are multiple maximum values correctly. According to the problem description, if there are multiple maximums, the program should print the one that comes first in the list. The current implementation uses `max(a)` to find the maximum value and then uses `index()` to find the first occurrence of that maximum value. However, if there are multiple expressions that yield the same maximum value, the `index()` method will return the index of the first occurrence of that maximum value in the list, which is correct. 

However, the issue arises if the maximum values are not unique and appear in different expressions. For example, if `x = 2.0`, `y = 2.0`, and `z = 2.0`, then all expressions will yield the same value of `2.0^2.0^2.0`, and the program will return `x^y^z` as expected. 

But if we consider a case where, for example, `x = 2.0`, `y = 3.0`, and `z = 2.0`, the results might yield two maximums, and the program does not check for the correct order of expressions that yield the same maximum value. The program only prints the first occurrence, which might not align with the problem's requirement of printing the expression that comes first in the list.

Thus, a potential input like `x = 2.0`, `y = 3.0`, and `z = 2.0` could lead to ambiguity in the output, as it does not guarantee that the first maximum expression is the one that is printed if there are ties. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the requirement of handling ties correctly with respect to the order of expressions.
