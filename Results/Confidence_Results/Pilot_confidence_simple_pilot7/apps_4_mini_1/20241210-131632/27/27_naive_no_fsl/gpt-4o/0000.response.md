Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three space-separated real numbers (x, y, z) from standard input, which are guaranteed to be within the specified range (0.1 to 200.0) and formatted to one decimal place.

2. **Expression Calculation**: It generates all twelve possible expressions as specified:
   - The expressions are calculated using Python's exponentiation operator, which is correctly applied in the order described.
   - The tuples contain both the computed value of the expression and its corresponding string representation.

3. **Finding the Maximum**: The program uses Python's `max` function with a custom key to find the maximum value among the calculated expressions. This ensures that it correctly identifies the maximum value.

4. **Handling Ties**: In the case of ties (where multiple expressions yield the same maximum value), the `max` function will return the first occurrence due to the way tuples are structured (the first element is the value, and the second is the expression). This adheres to the requirement of printing the expression that comes first in the list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required and handles all specified cases, including ties, it meets the problem's requirements without missing any edge cases.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
