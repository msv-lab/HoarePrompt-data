Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the maximum value of the expressions is achieved by multiple expressions with the same value. According to the problem description, if there are many maximums, the program should print the one that comes first in the list. However, the `max` function used in the program will return the first maximum it encounters, which is correct, but the logic does not account for the case where multiple expressions yield the same maximum value. 

For example, if we input the values `2.0 2.0 2.0`, both `x^y^z` and `y^x^z` would yield the same maximum value of 8.0, but the program will always choose the first occurrence, which is correct. However, if the expressions were to yield the same maximum in a different order, the program may not respect the priority of the first occurrence as intended in the problem description.

The program should explicitly check for this condition to ensure it is correctly identifying the first maximum in case of ties. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description completely, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
