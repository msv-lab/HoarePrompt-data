To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` days with `k_i` products and `l_i` clients.
- We can choose `f` days to double the products available for sale.
- The goal is to maximize the total number of products sold over the `n` days.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` and `f`, followed by pairs of integers representing `k_i` and `l_i`.
2. **Sales Calculation**:
   - `regular_sales`: This list contains the number of products sold on each day without any sell-out.
   - `potential_sales_increase`: This list calculates how many more products could be sold if that day was chosen for a sell-out.
3. **Total Sales Calculation**:
   - The total sales start with the sum of `regular_sales`.
   - It then adds the largest potential increases from the `potential_sales_increase` list, limited to `f` days.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When `f` is 0**: The function should only consider regular sales, which it does correctly.
2. **When `k_i` is 0**: If there are no products available on a day, the sales should be 0 regardless of the number of clients. The logic handles this by using `min(k, l)`, which will be 0.
3. **When `l_i` is 0**: If there are no clients, sales should also be 0. The logic again handles this correctly.
4. **Maximum Inputs**: The program should handle inputs where `n` is at its upper limit (100,000) and products/clients are at their maximum (up to 1 billion).

### Test Case to Consider:
Let's consider a case where:
- `n = 3`, `f = 1`
- Day 1: `k_1 = 5`, `l_1 = 10` (can sell 5)
- Day 2: `k_2 = 0`, `l_2 = 5` (can sell 0)
- Day 3: `k_3 = 10`, `l_3 = 3` (can sell 3)

If we choose Day 1 for sell-out, the potential sales would be:
- Day 1: `min(2 * 5, 10) = 10` (can sell 10)
- Day 2: `min(2 * 0, 5) = 0` (can sell 0)
- Day 3: `min(2 * 10, 3) = 3` (can sell 3)

The total sales would be `10 + 0 + 3 = 13`. 

However, if we choose Day 3 for sell-out instead:
- Day 1: `min(5, 10) = 5`
- Day 2: `min(0, 5) = 0`
- Day 3: `min(20, 3) = 3` (can sell 3)

The total sales would be `5 + 0 + 3 = 8`, which is less than the previous case.

### Conclusion:
The logic correctly computes the maximum sales based on the rules provided. I cannot find an edge case where the logic fails, as it handles all potential scenarios appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.
