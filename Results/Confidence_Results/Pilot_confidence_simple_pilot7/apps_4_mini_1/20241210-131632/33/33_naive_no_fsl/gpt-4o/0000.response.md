Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where Limak moves to the South Pole and then tries to move back to the North Pole. Specifically, the program allows for a situation where Limak can move South to the South Pole and then move North from the South Pole, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
20000 South
20000 North
```
In this case, Limak moves 20,000 kilometers South to the South Pole and then attempts to move 20,000 kilometers North. The program would incorrectly return "YES" because it checks the final position but does not enforce the rule that Limak cannot move North from the South Pole.

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the conditions outlined in the problem description, leading to its incorrectness.
