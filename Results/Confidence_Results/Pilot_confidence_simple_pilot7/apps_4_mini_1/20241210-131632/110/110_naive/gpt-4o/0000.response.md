To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Summary:
- We have a pond of size `n × m` with `k` fishes to place.
- A scoop of size `r × r` can be placed in various positions in the pond, and we want to maximize the expected number of fishes caught when the scoop is randomly placed.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` from standard input.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It creates a heap to store the coverage of each cell in the pond.
   - The coverage is calculated by the `coverage` function for each cell `(x, y)`.
   - The program selects the top `k` cells with the highest coverage and sums their coverage.
   - Finally, it divides the total coverage by the number of possible positions for the scoop to get the expected value.

3. **Coverage Calculation**:
   - The `coverage` function determines how many positions the scoop can cover if placed with its lower-left corner at `(x, y)`.
   - The coverage is calculated based on the boundaries of the pond and the scoop size.

### Potential Issues:
- **Coverage Logic**: The coverage calculation might not correctly account for the boundaries of the pond in all scenarios, especially at the edges and corners. The logic for calculating the maximum and minimum values in the `coverage` function could lead to incorrect coverage values.
  
- **Heap Usage**: The program assumes that the top `k` cells with the highest coverage will yield the maximum expected value, which might not be true if the fish placements are not optimal.

### Test Case Consideration:
1. **Edge Case**: For a very small pond, such as `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `r = 1`, and `k = 1`, the expected output should be `1.0` because the only cell can have one fish. The code should handle this correctly.
  
2. **Boundary Cases**: For larger values where `r` is equal to `n` or `m`, or when `k` is equal to `n * m`, the code should still provide valid expected values.

Given these considerations, I suspect that the coverage calculation might not work as expected for some configurations, especially near the edges of the pond.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, I believe the logic might fail in certain configurations, particularly regarding how coverage is calculated and how fishes are placed optimally.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Reason**: The program may not correctly compute the coverage for cells at the edges of the pond, which could lead to incorrect expected values.
