The provided program aims to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, within the given limits l and r. 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. The program reads four integers: l, r, x, and y.
2. It initializes a count variable to zero.
3. It uses two nested loops to iterate through all pairs (a, b) where l ≤ a ≤ r and l ≤ b ≤ r. However, it starts the inner loop from `a`, meaning it only checks pairs where a ≤ b. This means the pairs (b, a) are not counted, which is a critical oversight since the problem states that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.
4. The program checks if the GCD of a and b equals x and the LCM of a and b equals y using the helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
5. If both conditions are satisfied, the count is incremented.
6. Finally, it prints the count.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1 3 1 2
```
The valid pairs (a, b) within the range [1, 3] are:
- (1, 1): GCD(1, 1) = 1, LCM(1, 1) = 1 (not valid)
- (1, 2): GCD(1, 2) = 1, LCM(1, 2) = 2 (valid)
- (1, 3): GCD(1, 3) = 1, LCM(1, 3) = 3 (not valid)
- (2, 2): GCD(2, 2) = 2, LCM(2, 2) = 2 (not valid)
- (2, 3): GCD(2, 3) = 1, LCM(2, 3) = 6 (not valid)
- (3, 3): GCD(3, 3) = 3, LCM(3, 3) = 3 (not valid)

The only valid pair is (1, 2), which counts as one. However, the pair (2, 1) is also valid but will not be counted by the program because of the inner loop starting from `a`. Thus, the program will return a count of 1 instead of the correct count of 2.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for pairs (b, a) when a ≠ b due to the structure of the nested loops. Thus, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
