To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic it implements.

The problem requires finding the number of good pairs (a, b) such that:
1. GCD(a, b) = x
2. LCM(a, b) = y
3. l ≤ a, b ≤ r

The provided code defines two functions, `func_1` for calculating GCD and `func_2` for calculating LCM. It then iterates through all pairs (a, b) within the range [l, r], checking if they satisfy the GCD and LCM conditions.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Condition for LCM and GCD**: The relationship between GCD and LCM states that for any two integers a and b:
   \[
   GCD(a, b) \times LCM(a, b) = a \times b
   \]
   Therefore, for the pairs to be valid, it must hold that:
   \[
   x \times y = a \times b
   \]
   However, the code does not check this condition explicitly.

2. **Range of `b`**: The inner loop starts from `a`, which means it only counts pairs (a, b) where a ≤ b. This will miss pairs where a > b, which are also valid pairs according to the problem statement. 

3. **Counting Pairs**: The code counts pairs (a, b) but does not account for the fact that (b, a) should also be counted separately when a ≠ b. The current implementation will only count pairs where a ≤ b.

4. **Possible Cases**: Given the ranges for l, r, x, and y, there may be cases where valid pairs exist but are not counted due to the above issues.

### Test Case to Illustrate the Problem

Consider the input:
```
l = 1, r = 6, x = 1, y = 6
```
The valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy GCD(a, b) = 1 and LCM(a, b) = 6 are:
- (1, 6)
- (6, 1)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 2)

The code would only count pairs where a ≤ b, resulting in:
- (1, 6)
- (2, 3)

Thus, it would miss (6, 1) and (3, 2), leading to an incorrect count of 2 instead of the correct count of 4.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues, particularly the failure to account for the necessary conditions and the counting of pairs, we can conclude that the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
