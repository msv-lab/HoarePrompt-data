To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires us to calculate the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) is equal to \( f_{max}(n) \). The program defines a special case for \( n = 2 \) and uses a function `func_1` to compute the factorial of \( n - 1 \) for other values of \( n \).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Handling \( n = 2 \)**:
   - The program correctly returns `1` for \( n = 2 \), which is accurate since there is only one permutation \([1, 2]\) and \( f(p) = 1 \).

2. **Handling \( n > 2 \)**:
   - For \( n > 2 \), the program calls `func_1(n - 1, MOD)` which computes the factorial of \( n - 1 \). This is where the logic needs to be validated against the problem requirements.
   - The maximum value \( f_{max}(n) \) is \( n - 1 \) for \( n > 2 \) because we can achieve distinct GCDs up to \( n - 1 \) with certain permutations.
   - The number of permutations that yield \( f(p) = n - 1 \) is indeed \( (n - 1)! \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle any edge cases beyond \( n = 2 \). However, since it computes the factorial for \( n - 1 \) using a straightforward loop, it will work correctly for all \( n \) in the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the number of permutations \( p \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \) for all valid inputs based on the analysis of the factorial logic and the definition of \( f(p) \). There are no edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements as described.

Correctness: **True**.
