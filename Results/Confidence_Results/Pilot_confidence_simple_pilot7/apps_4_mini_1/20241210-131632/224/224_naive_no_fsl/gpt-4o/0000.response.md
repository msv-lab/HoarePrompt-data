To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it meets the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Function Definition**: We need to find `f(p)` for permutations of integers from `1` to `n`, where `f(p)` is defined as the number of distinct GCDs of prefixes of the permutation.
2. **Maximum Value**: We also need to compute `f_{max}(n)`, which is the maximum value of `f(p)` across all permutations of integers from `1` to `n`.
3. **Count Permutations**: Finally, we need to count the permutations that yield `f(p) = f_{max}(n)`.

### Code Analysis:
- The program starts by checking if `n` is equal to `2`. If so, it directly assigns the result to `1`.
- For values greater than `2`, it calls the function `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`, which computes the factorial of `n-1` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- The factorial computation is done through a loop that multiplies numbers from `2` to `n` and takes modulo at each step.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Understanding `f_{max}(n)`**: The program does not compute `f_{max}(n)` correctly. The maximum value of `f(p)` for a given `n` is not simply `n-1` or the factorial of `n-1`. The specific values of `f(p)` for permutations need to be analyzed to find `f_{max}(n)`.
2. **Hardcoding for `n=2`**: The program explicitly checks for `n=2` and returns `1`, which may not account for all cases correctly. The case for `n=2` is trivial, but the logic for larger values is not properly derived.
3. **Missing Logic**: The program lacks the logic to correctly derive how many permutations yield `f(p) = f_{max}(n)`. The factorial of `n-1` does not necessarily correspond to this count.

### Example of Failure:
For `n = 3`, the expected output is `4` (as provided in the example). However, the program calculates `result = func_1(2, MOD)`, which results in `2! = 2`. This is incorrect as it does not match the expected output of `4`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly compute `f_{max}(n)` and the number of permutations yielding that value, it fails for at least one input case (e.g., `n = 3`).

Correctness: **False**
