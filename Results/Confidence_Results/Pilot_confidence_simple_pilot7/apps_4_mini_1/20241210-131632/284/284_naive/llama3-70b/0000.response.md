To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and the implementation against the problem description.

The program aims to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that for a given positive integer \( n \), there exists a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using the `func_1` function.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) from input, which is within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \).

2. **Looping through \( m \)**: The program loops through \( m \) from 1 to 1000.

3. **Prime Check**: For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if it is not a prime number using `func_1`.

4. **Output**: If a non-prime number is found, it prints \( m \) and breaks the loop.

### Issues Identified:

- The function `func_1` correctly checks for prime numbers. However, the program assumes that it will always find a non-prime number within the range \( m = 1 \) to \( m = 1000 \). 

- The potential issue arises if, for a specific value of \( n \), all computed values \( n \cdot m + 1 \) for \( m \) from 1 to 1000 are prime. In such a case, the loop would not break, and no output would be produced, which contradicts the problem statement that guarantees an answer exists.

### Example of Failure:

For \( n = 1 \):
- The program computes \( 1 \cdot m + 1 = m + 1 \).
- For \( m = 1 \), \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) (prime).
- For \( m = 2 \), \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) (prime).
- Continuing this way, all values \( m + 1 \) where \( m \) is from 1 to 1000 will yield prime numbers (2, 3, 4, ..., 1001).

This shows that the program may not output anything if it fails to find a non-prime value within the expected range, which violates the requirement that an answer exists.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not guarantee to find a suitable \( m \) for all possible inputs \( n \) as required by the problem description, specifically failing in cases like \( n = 1 \).
