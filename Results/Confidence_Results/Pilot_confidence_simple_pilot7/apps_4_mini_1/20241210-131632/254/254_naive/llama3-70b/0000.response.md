To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
Mishka needs to switch on three garlands at specific moments such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of those moments. The garlands light up periodically based on their respective intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \).

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads three integers \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \).
2. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals using the formula:
   \[
   \text{lcm} = \frac{k_1 \cdot k_2 \cdot k_3}{\text{gcd}(k_1, k_2) \cdot \text{gcd}(k_2, k_3) \cdot \text{gcd}(k_1, k_3)}
   \]
3. It checks if the LCM is divisible by \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \).
4. If all three conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

### Potential Issues:
- The LCM being divisible by all three intervals does not guarantee that there will be no gaps in the lit seconds after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). For example, if the intervals are such that they do not cover all seconds after a certain point, the output would still incorrectly say "YES".
  
### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1 2 3
```
- The LCM of 1, 2, and 3 is 6.
- The program would check:
  - \( 6 \mod 1 == 0 \) (True)
  - \( 6 \mod 2 == 0 \) (True)
  - \( 6 \mod 3 == 0 \) (True)
- The program would output "YES". However, if we consider the moments of turning on the garlands, we can turn on the first garland at 1, the second at 2, and the third at 3. This would mean:
  - Garland 1 lights up every second (1, 2, 3, ...).
  - Garland 2 lights up every 2 seconds (2, 4, 6, ...).
  - Garland 3 lights up every 3 seconds (3, 6, ...).
  
  After the 3rd second, there are no gaps since garland 1 covers all seconds. However, if we take \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \):
```
4 2 3
```
- The LCM is 12. 
- The program would output "YES". However, turning on the garlands at optimal times (1, 2, 3) would leave gaps:
  - After the 4th second, there would be a gap (5th second is not covered by any garland).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify whether there will be at least one garland lit for every second after the maximum of the chosen moments. Thus, it can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
