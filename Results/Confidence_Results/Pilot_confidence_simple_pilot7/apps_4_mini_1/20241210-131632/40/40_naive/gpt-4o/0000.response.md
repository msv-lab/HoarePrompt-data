To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

The program is designed to find the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome. The logic it follows is:

1. If the length of the string `s` is less than or equal to 1, it prints `0` since a single character or an empty string is always a palindrome.
2. It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using the function `func_1`. If it's not a palindrome, it prints the length of the string.
3. If the string `s` is a palindrome, it checks the substrings formed by removing the first character (`s[1:]`) and the last character (`s[:-1]`). If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it prints the length of the substring (which would be `len(s) - 1`).
4. If all checks fail, it prints `0`, indicating that all substrings are palindromes.

Now, let's consider an edge case:

- Input: `"aa"`  
  The entire string is a palindrome, so the program checks `s[1:]` which is `"a"` (a palindrome) and `s[:-1]` which is also `"a"` (a palindrome). Thus, it would print `0`, which is incorrect because the longest non-palindrome substring is actually of length `1` (the single character substrings).

- Input: `"abcba"`  
  The entire string is a palindrome, and checking `s[1:]` gives `"bcba"` (which is also a palindrome) and `s[:-1]` gives `"abcb"` (which is also a palindrome). The output would be `0`, but the substring `"abc"` (length 3) is not a palindrome.

These examples show that the program fails to account for cases where the string is a palindrome, but there are still non-palindromic substrings of length greater than 1.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
