Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the program's logic is focused on counting the divisors of \( n \) rather than determining the different weights of its splits.

For example, consider the input \( n = 7 \):
- The splits of \( 7 \) that we can form are: 
  - Weight 1: \([7]\)
  - Weight 2: \([3, 3, 1]\)
  - Weight 3: \([2, 2, 2, 1]\)
  - Weight 7: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)

The correct answer for this input is 4, as there are 4 different weights. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) instead, which does not relate to the problem of counting the weights of splits.

For another input, \( n = 8 \):
- The splits of \( 8 \) are:
  - Weight 1: \([8]\)
  - Weight 2: \([4, 4]\)
  - Weight 3: \([3, 3, 2]\)
  - Weight 4: \([2, 2, 2, 2]\)
  - Weight 5: \([2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
  - Weight 8: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)

The correct answer for this input is 5 as well. The program does not compute these weights correctly.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
