The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in a string while ensuring that there are no uppercase letters between the positions of these lowercase letters. However, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Ignoring Uppercase Letters**: The program simply counts the number of lowercase letters without considering the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the positions of the distinct lowercase letters. This means it can incorrectly count lowercase letters that are separated by uppercase letters.

2. **Distinctness**: The program does not ensure that the counted lowercase letters are distinct. It just counts all lowercase letters, which can lead to over-counting if the same letter appears multiple times.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
6
aAbAb
```
- The expected output should be `1` because the lowercase letters 'a' and 'b' cannot be counted together due to the uppercase letters 'A' in between.
- However, the program would output `3` because it counts all instances of 'a' and 'b' without considering the uppercase letters.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it fails to produce the correct results for various cases.

Correctness: **False**
