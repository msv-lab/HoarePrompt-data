Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of elements in a "pretty" set of positions. 

Here are the issues:

1. The program simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string and prints that count. However, it does not take into account the conditions that define a "pretty" set:
   - The letters at the selected positions must be distinct.
   - There must not be any uppercase letters between the selected positions.

2. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   11
   aabBc
   ```
   The expected output should be `2`, as the positions `0` and `1` (both containing 'a') can be selected, but no uppercase letters are between them. The program would incorrectly return `3`, counting all lowercase letters without considering the uppercase constraint.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
