Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to consider all valid configurations of the stick parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10`. The correct configurations that allow for a rectangle but not a square would include `{1, 1, 4, 4}` and `{2, 2, 3, 3}`. However, the current implementation would not recognize these configurations correctly due to the limitations in the range of the loop and the logic used to calculate `rem`.

Additionally, the function only checks for `rem > 0` and `rem % 2 == 0`, but it does not ensure that the resulting parts can indeed form a rectangle while disallowing a square configuration. This oversight leads to missing valid configurations, demonstrating that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
