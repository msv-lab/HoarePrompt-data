To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

The problem requires us to count the number of distinct ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. The parts can form a rectangle.
2. The parts cannot form a square.

To form a rectangle using four parts, we need two pairs of equal lengths, i.e., the lengths can be represented as `{a, a, b, b}` where `a` and `b` are positive integers. To ensure that it cannot form a square, we need `a` to be different from `b`.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. It starts by checking if `n < 6`. If so, it returns `0` because it's impossible to make four positive parts.
2. It initializes a counter `count` to `0`.
3. It iterates through possible values of `a` from `1` to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it sets `b` equal to `a` and calculates the remainder `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)`.
4. It checks if `rem > 0` and if `rem` is even. If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If this is true, it increments the count.

### Potential Issues:
- The loop iterates `b` as equal to `a`, which means it only counts configurations like `{a, a, b, b}` where `a` and `b` are the same. This violates the requirement that `a` should not equal `b` for the configuration to not form a square.
- The program does not correctly account for all distinct configurations as it only considers `b` to be `a`. It should consider different values for `b` while ensuring they remain distinct from `a`.

### Example of Failure:
Consider `n = 10`. The expected valid configurations are:
- `{1, 1, 4, 4}`
- `{2, 2, 3, 3}`

However, the program will not find these configurations because it only allows `b` to equal `a`, leading to incorrect counting.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
