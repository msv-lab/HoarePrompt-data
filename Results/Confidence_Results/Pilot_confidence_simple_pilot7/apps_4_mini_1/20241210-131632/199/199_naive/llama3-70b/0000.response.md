To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program attempts to count the ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

The program defines a function `func_1(n)` which iterates through possible lengths `a` and `b` to find valid combinations such that:
1. The lengths are positive integers.
2. The total length equals `n`.
3. The lengths can form a rectangle (two pairs of equal lengths).
4. The lengths cannot form a square (all four lengths must not be the same).

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The outer loop iterates `a` from `1` to `n // 2`. This is appropriate since `a` must be a positive integer and cannot exceed half the stick length for the rectangle condition.
2. The inner loop iterates `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`. This ensures that `b` is at least equal to `a` (to avoid counting permutations of the same pair) and that the sum of lengths does not exceed `n`.
3. The condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` checks:
   - That `a` and `b` are not equal (to avoid forming a square).
   - That the total length is exactly `n` when doubled (which is required for forming a rectangle).

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle cases where `n` is less than 4. For instance:
  - If `n = 3`, there are no valid ways to split the stick since we cannot form four positive integer lengths.
  - If `n = 2`, the same issue arises.
  - If `n = 1`, the same issue arises.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for cases where `n < 4`, which should return `0` since it is impossible to split the stick into four positive integer lengths. This oversight leads to incorrect results for those inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

For example, for the input `n = 3`, the program would not return a valid count of ways (it would not return `0`), violating the problem's requirements.
