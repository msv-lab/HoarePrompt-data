To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem requires calculating the minimum jump ability for the Grasshopper to reach the end of a string while only landing on vowels. The program is expected to find the maximum distance between consecutive vowels (including the start and end of the string).

### Provided Program:
```python
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1. This is correct as the Grasshopper starts before the first character.
  
2. **Loop through the string**: The program iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is a vowel, it calculates the distance from the previous vowel position (`prev_pos`) to the current index (`i`) and updates `max_jump` if this distance is greater than the current `max_jump`.
   - It updates `prev_pos` to the current index `i`.

3. **Final Calculation**: After the loop, it checks the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string and updates `max_jump` accordingly.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **No Vowels**: If the input string contains no vowels, the Grasshopper cannot make any jumps on vowels. The code will return the length of the string plus one (which would be the distance from the start to the end), but this is not correct as the Grasshopper cannot reach the end.
- **All Vowels**: If the input string consists entirely of vowels, the jump ability should be 1 since he can jump from one vowel to the next directly.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input string `BCDFG` which contains no vowels. The expected output should be a representation of the Grasshopper's inability to jump, which the program does not handle correctly. The program will incorrectly return `7` (length of string + 1) instead of indicating that it's impossible to jump on vowels.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to handle the case where there are no vowels in the string correctly, we conclude that it does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
