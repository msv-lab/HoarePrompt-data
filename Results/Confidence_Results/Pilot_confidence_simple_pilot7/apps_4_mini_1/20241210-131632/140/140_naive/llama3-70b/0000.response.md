The provided program aims to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, the logic in the program only checks for cycles without considering the possibility of removing an edge to break a cycle. 

Here’s a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
```
In this case, there is a cycle (2 → 3 → 4 → 2). The program will detect the cycle and output "NO". However, by removing the edge `4 → 2`, the graph becomes acyclic, which means the correct output should be "YES".

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirement of checking if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

Correctness: **False**.
