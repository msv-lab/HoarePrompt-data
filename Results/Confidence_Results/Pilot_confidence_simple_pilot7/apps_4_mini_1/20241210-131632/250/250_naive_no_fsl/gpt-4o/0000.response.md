To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to measure two distances `x` and `y` using the marks on the ruler.
2. The ruler has a set of existing marks, and we can add new marks to help measure `x` and `y`.
3. The program should find out the minimum number of additional marks required and their positions.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and the list of marks.
2. **Distance Checking**:
   - The program checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using existing marks by checking if there exists a pair of marks such that their difference equals `x` or `y`.
   - It uses a set for `marks` to facilitate quick lookups.

3. **Adding New Marks**:
   - If either `x` or `y` cannot be measured, the program attempts to find a new mark that can help achieve this by checking combinations of existing marks.
   - The logic for adding new marks seems convoluted and may not cover all scenarios where new marks are needed.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly check if both `x` and `y` can be measured independently. It checks for their combinations but may miss cases where one distance can be measured only by adding a specific mark.
  
### Edge Case:
Consider the input:
```
2 100 30 60
0 100
```
- The existing marks are `0` and `100`. 
- The distances `30` and `60` cannot be measured. 
- The program might not add the necessary marks `30` and `60` because it could incorrectly assume that adding one mark is sufficient based on the conditions it checks.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly the one mentioned above. Therefore, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
