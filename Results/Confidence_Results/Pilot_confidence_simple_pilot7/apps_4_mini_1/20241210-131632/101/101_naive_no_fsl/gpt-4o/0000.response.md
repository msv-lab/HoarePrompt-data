To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and identify any potential cases where it may fail to meet the requirements.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the resolution of the monitor and the state of the pixels correctly.
2. **Finding the Frame**:
   - It initializes the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to determine the bounding box of the white pixels (`'w'`).
   - It iterates through the screen to find the minimum and maximum indices of the white pixels, which is correct.
3. **Frame Size Check**: 
   - The code checks if the height or width of the frame is less than 2. However, the problem states that a frame of size 1 should still be valid (i.e., a single white pixel).
   - This check incorrectly returns `-1` when there is only one white pixel or when the white pixels are aligned in such a way that they create a frame of size 1.
4. **Frame Construction**:
   - The program constructs the frame using `'+'` around the identified bounding box. This part of the code seems correct, but due to the previous check, it may never execute for valid scenarios where a frame of size 1 is needed.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2 2
w.
..
```
In this case, the expected output should be:
```
w+
+.
```
However, the program would incorrectly return `-1` because it checks for frame dimensions being less than 2, which fails for this input.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the frame can be of size 1 correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain valid inputs. 

Correctness: **False**
