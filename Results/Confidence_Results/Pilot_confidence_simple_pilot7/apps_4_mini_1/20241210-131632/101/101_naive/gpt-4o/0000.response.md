To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic based on the problem description and consider various edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the monitor and the state of the pixels correctly.
2. **Finding Frame Boundaries**: The program identifies the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost white pixels ('w') to determine the potential frame boundaries. 
3. **Frame Size Check**: The program checks if the frame height and width are at least 2. If either dimension is less than 2, it returns -1, which is correct since a frame of size 1 would not be valid.
4. **Constructing the Frame**: The program constructs the frame by replacing the appropriate pixels with '+' while ensuring that existing 'w' pixels are not changed.
5. **Output Handling**: The program outputs the modified screen or -1 if a valid frame cannot be formed.

### Edge Cases to Consider

- **Single Row or Column of White Pixels**: If there are white pixels in a single row or column, the frame cannot be formed, and the program should return -1.
- **All White Pixels**: If all pixels are white, the frame should still be constructed correctly.
- **No Valid Frame**: If the white pixels are isolated or do not allow for a frame to be formed (e.g., a single 'w' surrounded by black pixels), the program should correctly return -1.

### Test Cases

1. **Single Row/Column of White Pixels**:
   Input:
   ```
   1 5
   w....
   ```
   Expected Output: -1 (no frame can be formed).

2. **All White Pixels**:
   Input:
   ```
   3 3
   www
   www
   www
   ```
   Expected Output:
   ```
   +++
   +++
   +++
   ```

3. **Isolated White Pixel**:
   Input:
   ```
   3 3
   ...
   .w.
   ...
   ```
   Expected Output: -1 (no frame can be formed).

4. **Valid Frame Formation**:
   Input:
   ```
   4 4
   ....
   .w..
   .w..
   ....
   ```
   Expected Output:
   ```
   +++.
   +w+.
   +w+.
   +++.
   ```

### Conclusion

Upon analyzing the program and considering the edge cases, the program fails to handle the case where there is only one row or one column of white pixels correctly. It does not return -1 in such cases, which violates the problem requirements.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where a valid frame cannot be formed due to insufficient dimensions of white pixels correctly.
