Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting length x. 

To illustrate this, consider the input case where x = 6 and y = 3. The expected output is 4, as described in the problem. However, the program calculates the output as follows:

1. The difference between x and y is 6 - 3 = 3.
2. The program computes the result using the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which evaluates to:
   - `(3) // 2 + (3) % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

Thus, the program outputs 2, which is incorrect because it fails to account for the necessary steps to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate at all times. 

In the example, the correct sequence of modifications to reach (3, 3, 3) from (6, 6, 6) requires 4 steps, not 2. Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all cases.
