Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to find the optimal location for the heat source to minimize the time required to grill at least K pieces of meat. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Grid Search Limitation**: The program uses a grid search over integer coordinates from (-1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000). This approach may not find the optimal solution because the optimal position for the heat source can be a non-integer point. The problem statement allows for real numbers for coordinates (X, Y), so the program might miss the optimal placement if it lies between the integer coordinates.

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The `func_2` function is called with the same parameters for `x` and `y` which are the coordinates of the meat piece, instead of using the heat source coordinates (X, Y). This will not yield the correct grilling times.

3. **Sorting and Time Calculation**: The sorting of times in `func_3` assumes that the K-th piece can be directly accessed after sorting, but since the times are calculated based on the wrong coordinates, this logic is flawed.

For example, consider a case where the optimal heat source position is at (0.5, 0.5). The grid search will not reach this point since it only checks integer coordinates, thus potentially missing the optimal solution.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
