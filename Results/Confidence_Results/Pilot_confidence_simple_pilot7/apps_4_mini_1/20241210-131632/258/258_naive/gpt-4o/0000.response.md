To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and flow of the program.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program reads `N` (number of pieces of meat) and `K` (number of pieces of meat Takahashi wants to eat). It then reads the coordinates `(x_i, y_i)` and hardness `c_i` for each piece of meat.
2. **Output**: The program should compute the minimum time required to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready to eat.
3. **Grilling Time Calculation**: The time required for a piece of meat to be ready is given by `c_i * sqrt((X - x_i)^2 + (Y - y_i)^2)`, where `(X, Y)` is the position of the heat source.

### Program Logic:
- **func_1**: This function checks if a given time `T` is sufficient to grill at least `K` pieces of meat. It calculates potential positions for the heat source based on pairs of meat pieces and checks how many pieces can be grilled within time `T`.
- **func_2**: This function performs a binary search to find the minimum time `T` that allows grilling at least `K` pieces of meat.
- **func_3**: This function handles input and output.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Precision**: The binary search continues until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than `1e-07`, which may not guarantee that the result is within the required precision of `1e-06` for all edge cases.
2. **Edge Cases with `K`**: The logic in `func_1` assumes that there are always enough pieces to check against, but it doesn't handle cases where all pieces are far enough apart that their distances make it impossible to grill `K` pieces within any reasonable time.
3. **Handling of `T`**: The condition `if c1 * T < c2 * T:` seems redundant and could lead to incorrect comparisons, especially when `T` is very small or zero.

### Example Case:
Consider a case where:
- `N = 2`, `K = 2`
- Meat pieces: `(-1000, -1000, 1)` and `(1000, 1000, 1)`

In this case, even if the heat source is placed optimally, the time required to grill both pieces of meat will be significantly high due to the distance between them. The algorithm might fail to recognize that it is impossible to grill both pieces within a reasonable time, thus returning an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues identified, particularly with precision and edge case handling, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
