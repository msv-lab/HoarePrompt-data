Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal, and there are unknown votes. For example, if we have:

Input:
```
1 1 1
```

In this case:
- Minimum upvotes = 1
- Maximum upvotes = 2 (1 + 1)
- Minimum downvotes = 1
- Maximum downvotes = 2 (1 + 1)

Here, the possible outcomes are:
1. All unknown votes upvote: 2 upvotes, 1 downvote → result is "+"
2. One unknown vote upvotes and one unknown vote downvotes: 1 upvote, 1 downvote → result is "0"
3. All unknown votes downvote: 1 upvote, 2 downvotes → result is "-"

Since there are multiple possible results ("+", "0", and "-"), the correct output should be "?" indicating uncertainty. However, the program would incorrectly classify this as certain. Therefore, the program's logic does not cover this edge case, leading to incorrect outputs.
