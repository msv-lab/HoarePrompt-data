To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function against all possible scenarios defined by the input parameters \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Input Interpretation**:
   - \( x \): Number of guaranteed upvotes.
   - \( y \): Number of guaranteed downvotes.
   - \( z \): Number of uncertain votes (unknown whether they will upvote or downvote).

2. **Output Logic**:
   - If \( x > y + z \): The output is `+`, meaning there are enough guaranteed upvotes to ensure a positive result, regardless of how the uncertain votes are cast.
   - If \( x < y \): The output is `-`, meaning there are more guaranteed downvotes than upvotes, resulting in a negative outcome.
   - If \( x == y \):
     - If \( z == 0 \): The output is `0`, indicating a tie since there are no uncertain votes.
     - If \( z > 0 \): The output is `?`, indicating uncertainty because the uncertain votes could tip the balance either way.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to outputting `?`, which is effectively covered by the previous checks.

### Checking for Edge Cases

Let's examine some edge cases based on the input ranges from 0 to 100:

1. **Case 1**: \( x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 \)
   - Expected Output: `0` (no votes at all, so it's a tie).
   - Program Output: `0` (correct).

2. **Case 2**: \( x = 0, y = 0, z = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: `?` (one uncertain vote could lead to either an upvote or downvote).
   - Program Output: `?` (correct).

3. **Case 3**: \( x = 3, y = 7, z = 0 \)
   - Expected Output: `-` (7 downvotes vs 3 upvotes).
   - Program Output: `-` (correct).

4. **Case 4**: \( x = 2, y = 0, z = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: `+` (2 upvotes and 1 uncertain vote can only lead to a positive result).
   - Program Output: `+` (correct).

5. **Case 5**: \( x = 1, y = 1, z = 0 \)
   - Expected Output: `0` (1 upvote and 1 downvote, resulting in a tie).
   - Program Output: `0` (correct).

6. **Case 6**: \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: `?` (1 downvote and 1 uncertain vote could lead to either a tie or a negative outcome).
   - Program Output: `?` (correct).

7. **Case 7**: \( x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: `?` (1 upvote and 1 downvote, plus 1 uncertain vote could lead to different outcomes).
   - Program Output: `?` (correct).

8. **Case 8**: \( x = 100, y = 0, z = 0 \)
   - Expected Output: `+` (100 upvotes with no downvotes).
   - Program Output: `+` (correct).

### Conclusion

After checking various edge cases and scenarios, the program handles all possible inputs correctly according to the problem description. There are no cases where the program fails to produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**.
