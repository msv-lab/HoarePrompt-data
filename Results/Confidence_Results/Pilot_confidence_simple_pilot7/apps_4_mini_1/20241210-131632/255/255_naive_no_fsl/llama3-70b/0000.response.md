Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the whole string according to the problem description. 

The logic implemented in the program counts the number of contiguous segments of different characters, which does not correspond to the required operations for deleting the string. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5
aabaa
```

The expected output is `2` because we can delete "aaa" in one operation and then "b" in another operation. However, the program would output `3` because it counts the transitions between 'a' and 'b', resulting in an incorrect answer.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
