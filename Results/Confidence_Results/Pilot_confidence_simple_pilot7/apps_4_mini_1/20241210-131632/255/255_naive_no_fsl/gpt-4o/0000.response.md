To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings of equal letters. The provided program counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string and initializes the operation count to 1. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the fact that multiple contiguous characters of the same type can be removed in a single operation.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this flaw:

Input:
```
5
aaaaa
```
Expected output:
```
1
```
Explanation: The entire string "aaaaa" can be removed in one operation since all characters are the same.

However, the program would output:
```
5
```
Explanation: The program would count each character as a separate operation because it only increments the operation count when it encounters a different character.

Another case to consider:
Input:
```
6
aaabbb
```
Expected output:
```
2
```
Explanation: The string can be removed in two operations: first remove "aaa" and then "bbb".

The program would output:
```
2
```
This particular case seems to work, but it fails for strings where there are contiguous characters.

Thus, we can conclude that the program does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
