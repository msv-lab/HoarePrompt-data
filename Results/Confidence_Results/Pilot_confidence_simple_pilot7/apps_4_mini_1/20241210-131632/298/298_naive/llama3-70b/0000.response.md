To analyze the given program against the problem description, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies whether it's possible to find three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The area of the triangle formed by the points must equal \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
2. The points must lie within the bounds defined by \( n \) and \( m \) (i.e., \( 0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m \)).
3. If it's not possible to find such points, the output should be "NO".

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
2. **Area Check**: It checks if \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \). If not, it prints "NO".
3. **Finding Points**: The program uses a function `func_3` to find integer coefficients that satisfy the area condition. The points are then calculated based on these coefficients.
4. **Output of Points**: If the conditions are met, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points. If the conditions are not met, it prints "NO".

### Potential Issues:
- The area must be a non-negative integer. The program checks for divisibility but does not ensure that the resulting area \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is non-negative.
- The program does not guarantee that the calculated points \( (0, 0) \), \( (0, n1 \times m / g) \), and \( (m1 \times m / g, 0) \) are within the bounds \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \).

### Testing with Edge Cases:
Let's consider the case where \( n = 1 \), \( m = 1 \), and \( k = 2 \):
- The expected area would be \( \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer. The program should return "NO".
- However, if \( n = 2 \), \( m = 2 \), and \( k = 2 \):
  - The area would be \( \frac{2 \times 2}{2} = 2 \). The program should find valid points, but it may not correctly check the bounds of the calculated points.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly ensuring that the points are within the specified bounds after calculation. Therefore, it can produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
