To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code step by step.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to find `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to the power of each integer equals `n`, while minimizing the largest integer in the sequence and ensuring the sequence is lexicographically largest.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Check**: If `n < k`, it prints "No" because it's impossible to represent `n` as the sum of `k` positive integers (since the smallest sum of `k` integers is `k`).
3. **Building the Sequence**:
   - A loop is used to find powers of `2` that can be subtracted from `n`.
   - The `bit_length()` method is utilized to find the highest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - The found powers are appended to the list `a`, and `n` is decremented accordingly.
4. **Final Check**: After attempting to build the list, if the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints "No". Otherwise, it sorts `a` in descending order and prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling Negative Powers**: The program does not handle the case where we might need negative powers of `2` to form the sum when `n` is small and `k` is large. For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program outputs "Yes" with a list of powers that don't actually sum to `1` (it would need to use `-1` as `2^{-1}`).
2. **Lexicographical Order**: The program sorts the powers in descending order but does not ensure that the resulting sequence is lexicographically largest if there are multiple valid combinations.

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
1 2
```
According to the problem description, the output should be "Yes" and the sequence should be `-1 -1` since `2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1`. However, the program will produce "No" because it does not account for the possibility of using negative powers of `2`.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
