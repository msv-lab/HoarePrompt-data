To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`. It checks if `n < k`. If this condition is true, it prints "No" because it's impossible to form a sum of `n` using `k` integers (each integer must be at least 0).

2. **Finding Powers of Two**: 
   - The program uses a while loop to find the largest power of 2 that can be subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0.
   - It appends the power of 2's exponent to the list `a`.

3. **Checking Length of Result**: After exiting the loop, it checks if the length of list `a` is less than `k`. If it is, it prints "No".

4. **Final Output**:
   - If the length of `a` is at least `k`, it truncates or sorts the list to ensure it has exactly `k` elements.
   - The program sorts `a` in reverse order and prints "Yes" followed by the elements of `a`.

### Potential Issues

- **Lexicographical Order**: The program does not guarantee that the output is lexicographically largest when it only truncates `a` to `k` elements. If `a` contains more than `k` elements, simply truncating it without further adjustment may not yield the lexicographically largest sequence.
  
- **Negative Powers**: The program does not correctly handle cases where negative powers are needed. For example, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 2, the program should output `-1 -1` (representing \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1\)), but it does not consider negative powers.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the input:
```
1 2
```
According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
Yes
-1 -1
```
However, the program does not account for this case correctly since it does not allow for negative powers of 2 in its logic. It would exit the loop without adding any values to `a` and would end up printing "No".

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly the handling of negative powers and ensuring the lexicographically largest sequence. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
