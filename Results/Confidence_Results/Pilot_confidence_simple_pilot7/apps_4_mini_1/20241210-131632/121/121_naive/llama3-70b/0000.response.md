To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The input consists of an integer `n` (length of the genome) and a string `s` (the genome itself, containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?').
2. Each of the four nucleotides should occur an equal number of times in the decoded genome.
3. If it's possible to decode the genome, the program should print the decoded string; otherwise, it should print "===".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program counts occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and stores them in a dictionary called `count`.
2. **Calculating Required Counts**: It calculates `avg`, which is `n // 4`, representing how many times each nucleotide should appear.
3. **Determining Replacements**: It then calculates how many more of each nucleotide are needed by subtracting the current counts from `avg`.
4. **Building the Result**: The program constructs the resulting string by replacing '?' with the required nucleotides in order until all '?' are replaced or until it runs out of needed nucleotides.
5. **Final Check**: Finally, it checks if there are any remaining counts needed. If there are, it prints "==="; otherwise, it prints the constructed string.

### Edge Cases:
- **Input Length Not Divisible by 4**: If `n` is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide. The program does not handle this case explicitly and will still try to decode the genome, which could lead to incorrect behavior.
- **More '?' than Needed**: If there are more '?' than the needed nucleotides to balance the counts, the program may still incorrectly attempt to decode and produce an invalid result.

### Example Cases:
1. **Case with n = 5**: 
   - Input: `5` and `A???`
   - The program calculates `avg = 5 // 4 = 1`. It needs 1 of each nucleotide, but there are not enough characters to satisfy this requirement, leading to an incorrect output.
   - Expected output: `===`, but the program would attempt to fill it and potentially produce `AAGCT`, which is incorrect.

2. **Case with n = 7**:
   - Input: `7` and `??G??C?`
   - The program should print `===` since `7` is not divisible by `4`, but it will try to decode it anyway.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases where `n` is not divisible by 4, which is a critical requirement as per the problem description. Therefore, it does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
