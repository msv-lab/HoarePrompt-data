Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle cases where the number of question marks (`?`) is not sufficient to balance the counts of nucleotides. Specifically, it does not check whether the total number of characters in the string `s` can be evenly distributed among the four nucleotide types.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
A??C??GT
```
In this case, the counts of nucleotides are:
- A: 1
- C: 1
- G: 1
- T: 1
- ?: 4

The average required for each nucleotide type is `8 // 4 = 2`. The current counts indicate that we need one more 'A', one more 'C', one more 'G', and one more 'T'. The total number of required nucleotides is 4, and we have 4 question marks available, so it seems possible to fill it.

However, if we had the input:
```
8
A??C??G?
```
The counts would be the same, but we would have only 3 question marks. The program would incorrectly output a decoded string despite it being impossible to balance the nucleotides.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle situations where the number of question marks is insufficient to balance the nucleotides, leading to an incorrect output.
