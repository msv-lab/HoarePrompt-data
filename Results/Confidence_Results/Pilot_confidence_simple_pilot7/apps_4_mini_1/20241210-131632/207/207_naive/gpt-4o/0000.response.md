To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and check if it adheres to the requirements for all potential cases.

### Problem Analysis:
The frog can jump to positions based on two integers `a` and `b`. The function `f(x)` calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]`. The final output is the sum of `f(i)` for all integers `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` to simplify the problem. This is correct for reducing the jumps to their simplest form.
2. The function `func_2` handles the main logic:
   - It checks if `g` (GCD) is not `1`, and if so, it recursively calls itself with reduced values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.
   - If `m` is less than `k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), it calculates the sum of integers from `0` to `m`, which is correct.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sums accordingly.

### Edge Cases:
- If `a` and `b` are both `1`, the frog can only jump to every integer in `[0, m]`, thus `f(i) = i + 1` for all `i`, and the sum should be `m * (m + 1) / 2 + (m + 1)`.
- If `a` is large compared to `m`, the frog may only reach a few positions, which should be correctly handled by the code.
- If `b` is larger than `m`, the frog cannot jump backwards to positions less than `0`, which should also be accounted for.

### Potential Failure Case:
Consider the case where `m = 0`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`. According to the program:
- For `f(0)`, the frog can only be at position `0`, so `f(0) = 1`.
- The program should return `1` for this case, which it does correctly.

However, when we test with larger values, such as `m = 1`, `a = 1`, and `b = 2`, we need to ensure that the output correctly reflects the reachable positions. The program should be able to handle such cases without any logical errors.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering edge cases, I did not find any instance where the program would fail to meet the problem description. The logic seems sound, and it handles the cases described correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
