To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it covers all edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The frog starts at position `0` and can jump to `k + a` or `k - b`.
2. We need to calculate `f(x)`, which is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]`.
3. Finally, we need to compute the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This is important because if `g = gcd(a, b)`, the frog can only reach multiples of `g`.
2. **Reduction**: If `g` is not `1`, the function reduces the problem by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`. This is valid because the reachable positions will still be multiples of `g`.
3. **Position Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `k = a + b - 1`.
   - If `m < k`, it calculates the sum of integers from `0` to `m`, which is correct.
   - If `m >= k`, it calculates two sums: one for the first `k` numbers and another for the range from `k` to `m`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: When `m = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`, the frog can only jump to `1` and back to `0`. Thus, `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 2`. The output should be `3`.
2. **Large `m` Values**: The program should handle cases where `m` is very large, close to `10^9`, ensuring that the calculations do not overflow and remain efficient.

### Testing Possible Failure Cases:
- **Case**: If `m = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`. The expected output is `3` because:
  - `f(0) = 1` (only `0` is reachable),
  - `f(1) = 2` (both `0` and `1` are reachable).
- **Program Output**: The program should return `3` for this input.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to calculate `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`. The GCD reduction is correctly handled, and the calculations for sums are accurate.

Since I cannot find a single case where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
