To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Understanding:
The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by `a` or backward by `b`. We need to compute `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(i)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, i]`.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The code initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1` to store the number of ways to reach each position.
2. **Base Case**: `dp[0]` is set to `1`, indicating that the frog can start at position `0`.
3. **Jump Logic**:
   - For each position `i`, if the frog can jump to `i + a` without exceeding `m`, it adds `dp[i]` to `dp[i + a]`.
   - For backward jumps, it incorrectly attempts to add `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]`, which is not the intended logic. The backward jump should not affect `dp[i]` directly, as it should represent the number of ways to reach that position, not accumulate from others.
4. **Final Output**: The program prints the sum of all `dp` values.

### Problems in the Code:
- The backward jump logic is incorrect because it modifies `dp[i]` instead of ensuring that the frog can reach `i` from `i + b`. This will lead to incorrect counting of reachable positions.
- The current implementation does not correctly compute `f(i)` as defined in the problem statement, which may lead to incorrect results.

### Test Case to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the case where `m = 1`, `a = 1`, and `b = 1`. According to the rules:
- `f(0)` should be `1` (only position `0` is reachable).
- `f(1)` should be `2` (positions `0` and `1` are reachable).

However, due to the incorrect logic in the code, the output will not reflect this accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified, particularly in handling backward jumps and accurately computing `f(i)`. Therefore, we conclude that the implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
