To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: A positive integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
2. **Output**: 
   - Print "YES" if a sequence of fractions can be found such that:
     - \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \)
     - \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \)
     - The sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).
   - Print "NO" if such a sequence does not exist.
   - If a sequence exists, also print the number of fractions \( k \) and the fractions themselves.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) and checks if \( n \leq 2 \). If so, it returns "NO", which is correct since for \( n = 2 \), there are no valid \( b_i \) values.
2. **Finding Divisors**: The program attempts to find divisors of \( n \) in the range \( 2 \) to \( \sqrt{n} \). It collects these divisors in a list.
3. **Checking Divisors**: If no divisors are found, it returns "NO". This is correct, as it indicates that \( n \) is prime or has no valid divisors in the specified range.
4. **Generating Fractions**: The program generates fractions \( \frac{1}{d} \) for each divisor \( d \) found.
5. **Output Format**: The program prints "YES", the count of fractions, and the fractions themselves.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Sum of Fractions**: The critical part of the problem is ensuring that the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). The program does not check if the generated fractions actually sum to this value. It simply returns the fractions based on the divisors found, which may not satisfy the sum condition.
2. **Edge Cases**: For certain values of \( n \), even if the program produces fractions, they may not sum to the required \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). For instance, for \( n = 3 \), the only divisor is \( 3 \) itself, which is not valid since \( b_i \) must be less than \( n \).

### Example of Failure:
Consider \( n = 3 \):
- The program will return "NO" correctly, as there are no valid divisors.
Now consider \( n = 4 \):
- The divisors are \( 2 \).
- The program will generate the fraction \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- However, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), and \( \frac{1}{2} \) does not satisfy this equation.

Thus, the program fails to ensure that the generated fractions meet the sum condition for all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the requirement that the sum of the fractions must equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \) for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
