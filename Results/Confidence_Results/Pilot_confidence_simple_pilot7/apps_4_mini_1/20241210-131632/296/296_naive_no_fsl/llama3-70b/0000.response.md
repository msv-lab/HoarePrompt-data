Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

1. The program only checks if `n` is equal to `2` and directly outputs "NO" in that case. However, it does not handle other values of `n` correctly. For example, if `n = 4`, the expected output should be "YES" with the fractions `1/2` and `1/4`, since `1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 = 1 - 1/4`. The program fails to consider valid cases where `n` is even and greater than `2`.

2. The logic for generating fractions is incomplete. The program outputs `1` and `n // 2`, which does not satisfy the condition that `b_i` must divide `n` and `1 < b_i < n`. For example, if `n = 6`, the output should include fractions like `1/2` and `1/3`, but the program does not compute these correctly.

3. The program does not consider odd values of `n` or other even values greater than `2` properly, which can lead to incorrect outputs.

Thus, since the program does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
