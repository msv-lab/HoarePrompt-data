To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and identify any potential edge cases or scenarios where it might fail.

The problem requires us to compute the minimum number of coins each friend must gift Ivan such that:
1. All friends gift the same number of coins.
2. All gifted coins must be different.
3. At least \( L \) coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

Given the input parameters:
- \( N \): Total different collectible coins.
- \( M \): Number of Ivan's friends.
- \( K \): Number of coins Ivan already has.
- \( L \): Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

The program calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend must gift, calculated as:
```python
min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
```
This ensures that at least \( L \) new coins are given collectively by all friends.

Next, it checks if the total coins gifted by all friends can fit within the remaining coins that Ivan doesn't have:
```python
if M * min_x <= N - K:
```
If this condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`, otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Cases to Consider:
1. **Insufficient Unique Coins**: If \( M > N \) (more friends than unique coins), it's impossible for each friend to gift a different coin.
2. **Insufficient New Coins**: If \( K + L > N \), it means even if all new coins were gifted, Ivan would still exceed the number of available unique coins.
3. **Minimum Gifts Calculation**: If \( L = 0 \), the program should still allow for \( min_x = 0 \) if \( M \) can gift coins without exceeding \( N - K \).

### Example Analysis:
1. **Example 1**: Input `20 15 2 3`
   - \( N = 20 \), \( M = 15 \), \( K = 2 \), \( L = 3 \)
   - `min_x = (3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
   - Check: \( 15 * 1 \leq 20 - 2 \) (True)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: Input `10 11 2 4`
   - \( N = 10 \), \( M = 11 \), \( K = 2 \), \( L = 4 \)
   - `min_x = (4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`
   - Check: \( 11 * 1 \leq 10 - 2 \) (False)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

### Edge Case:
- Input `5 3 2 4`
  - \( N = 5 \), \( M = 3 \), \( K = 2 \), \( L = 4 \)
  - `min_x = (4 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 2`
  - Check: \( 3 * 2 \leq 5 - 2 \) (False)
  - Expected Output: `-1` (Correctly handled)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and considering edge cases, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. There are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the conditions specified.

Correctness: **True**
