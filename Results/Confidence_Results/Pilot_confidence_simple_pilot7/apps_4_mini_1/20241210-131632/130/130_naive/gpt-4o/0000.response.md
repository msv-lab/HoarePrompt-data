To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Ivan has `K` coins out of `N` different collectible coins.
2. He has `M` friends who must each gift the same number of coins.
3. All gifted coins must be different.
4. At least `L` coins from the gifts must be new to Ivan's collection.
5. We need to find the minimum number of coins each friend can gift or determine if it's impossible.

### Program Analysis:
```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M  # Minimum coins each friend must gift
    if M * min_x <= N - K:  # Check if they can gift enough new coins
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Key Points in the Implementation:
- The program calculates `min_x`, the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to ensure that at least `L` new coins are given.
- It checks if the total number of coins gifted (`M * min_x`) does not exceed the number of new coins available (`N - K`).
- If the condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `K` is equal to `N`:** 
   - If Ivan already has all the coins (`K = N`), then no new coins can be gifted. If `L > 0`, it is impossible to satisfy the requirement, and the output should be `-1`.
   - Example: `N = 10, M = 5, K = 10, L = 1` should output `-1`, but the program will incorrectly calculate `min_x` and output `0` since `0 * 5 <= 0` is true.

2. **When `M` is greater than `N`:**
   - If the number of friends `M` exceeds the total different coins `N`, it's impossible for each friend to gift a different coin, hence should return `-1`.
   - Example: `N = 10, M = 11, K = 2, L = 1` should output `-1`, but the program will incorrectly calculate `min_x` and output `0` since `0 * 11 <= 8` is true.

3. **When `L` is greater than `N - K`:**
   - If the required number of new coins `L` exceeds the available new coins (`N - K`), then it is impossible to satisfy the requirement.
   - Example: `N = 10, M = 5, K = 8, L = 3` should return `-1`, but the program will incorrectly calculate `min_x` and output `1` since `1 * 5 <= 2` is true.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, specifically when `K` equals `N`, when `M` exceeds `N`, and when `L` is greater than `N - K`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
