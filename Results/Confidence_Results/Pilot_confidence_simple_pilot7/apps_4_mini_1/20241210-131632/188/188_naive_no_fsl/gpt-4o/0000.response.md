To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Constraints**: The number of cards `n` is even and ranges from 2 to 100. Each card has an integer between 1 and 100.
2. **Game Fairness**: The game is fair if:
   - Petya and Vasya can choose two distinct integers.
   - All `n` cards can be distributed equally between them, meaning each must get exactly `n/2` cards.

### Program Logic:
1. The program reads the number of cards and the integers on them.
2. It counts the occurrences of each integer using `Counter`.
3. It checks if there are at least two unique integers.
4. It checks if the two most common integers have exactly `n/2` occurrences each.
5. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and the two integers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases:
1. **All Cards the Same**: If all cards have the same number, the output should be "NO" (handled correctly).
   - Example: Input: `2` followed by `6` and `6`. Output: `NO`.
   
2. **Only Two Unique Numbers**: If there are exactly two unique numbers but their counts are not `n/2`, it should also return "NO".
   - Example: Input: `4` followed by `1, 1, 2, 2`. Output: `YES` (correct).
   - Example: Input: `4` followed by `1, 1, 1, 2`. Output: `NO` (handled correctly).

3. **More than Two Unique Numbers**: The program only considers the two most common numbers, which might lead to missing valid configurations.
   - Example: Input: `6` followed by `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`. The counts are `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2}`. The program will output `YES` and choose `2` and `3`, which is valid. However, it could have chosen `1` and `2` as well, which is also valid. This part is handled correctly.

4. **Not Enough Cards**: If the total cards do not allow a fair distribution, it must return "NO".
   - Example: Input: `6` followed by `10, 20, 30, 20, 10, 20`. The counts are `{10: 2, 20: 3, 30: 1}`. It should return `NO` (handled correctly).

### Potential Case of Failure:
The program does not handle the case where there are multiple valid distributions but fails to recognize them. For example:
- Input: `4` followed by `1, 1, 2, 2`. The program will output `YES` and choose `2` and `1`, which is correct.
- Input: `4` followed by `1, 1, 1, 2`. The program will output `NO`, which is also correct.

However, there is a flaw in the logic when there are more than two unique numbers with valid counts. It may miss configurations where other pairs of integers could yield a fair game. For example:
- Input: `6` followed by `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`. The program correctly identifies that it can choose `1` and `2`, but it does not account for the fact that `2` and `3` are also valid choices. 

### Conclusion:
The program would fail in cases where there are more than two unique integers, but the two most common do not satisfy the count condition, even if there are other pairs that do.

Thus, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
