To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it covers all possible scenarios as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We have `n` cards with integers on them, where `n` is guaranteed to be even.
2. Petya and Vasya need to choose distinct integers such that they can take all cards and each player ends up with the same number of cards.
3. If it is impossible for them to choose such integers, the output should be "NO".
4. If they can choose distinct integers fulfilling the conditions, output "YES" followed by the two integers.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
- It reads the number of cards `n` and the integers on each card.
- It counts the occurrences of each integer using a dictionary.
- It checks if there are two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n/2` times.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider the edge cases based on the problem description:

1. **All cards have the same number**: The program should return "NO" since Petya and Vasya cannot choose distinct integers.
   - Example Input: 
     ```
     4
     5
     5
     5
     5
     ```
   - Expected Output: "NO"

2. **Two distinct numbers with equal counts**: The program should return "YES" and the two numbers.
   - Example Input:
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     2
     2
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     YES
     1 2
     ```

3. **More than two distinct numbers**: The program should still return "YES" if there are at least two numbers with `n/2` counts.
   - Example Input:
     ```
     6
     3
     3
     4
     4
     5
     5
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     YES
     3 4
     ```

4. **Not enough cards to fulfill the requirement**: If the maximum count of any number is less than `n/2`, it should return "NO".
   - Example Input:
     ```
     6
     1
     1
     1
     2
     2
     3
     ```
   - Expected Output: "NO"

### Issue in the Program:
The program only checks for two numbers that appear exactly `n/2` times. However, it does not handle cases where there might be two distinct numbers that together can account for `n` cards but do not each individually meet the `n/2` requirement.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
The output should be "YES" with any of the two numbers (1 and 2). However, if the counts were:
```
4
1
1
1
2
```
The output should be "NO" because there is no way to choose two numbers that allow for equal distribution.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to cover all potential cases, particularly when there are not exactly two numbers with counts of `n/2`. 

Correctness: **False**.
