To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and check if it adheres to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Starting Point**: Lara starts at cell (1, 1).
2. **Movement**: 
   - She moves down to (n, 1).
   - Then she moves in a snake-like pattern:
     - For each complete row (except the last row), she moves right.
     - After reaching the end of a row, she moves one cell up and then moves left in the next row.
3. **Output Requirement**: We need to determine the cell coordinates (row, column) after `k` moves.

### Code Logic:
1. **Initial Down Movement**:
   - If `k < n - 1`, Lara has not yet reached the bottom row. The output will be `(k + 1, 1)`, which corresponds to the row number after moving down `k` times.
   
2. **Post Down Movement**:
   - If `k >= n - 1`, it indicates Lara has reached the bottom row. The program calculates:
     - The number of full rows traversed after reaching the bottom, using `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`.
     - The remaining steps within the current row using `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`.
   - Depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, the program determines the row and column:
     - If `full_rows` is even, Lara is moving right in a row.
     - If `full_rows` is odd, Lara is moving left in a row.

### Potential Issue:
1. **Boundary Condition**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where `k` equals `n * m - 1` (the maximum possible moves before hitting the boundary). This case should correspond to the last cell (n, m), but the program does not account for it correctly.

### Example Case:
- For `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 11` (which is `n * m - 1`):
  - The expected output should be `(4, 3)`, but the program will not reach this condition correctly since it does not handle the case where all cells have been visited.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program fails to handle the maximum boundary condition correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
