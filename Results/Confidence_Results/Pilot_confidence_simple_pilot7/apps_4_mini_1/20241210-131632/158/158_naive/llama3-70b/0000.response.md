To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the `func()` function.

The function reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has, respectively. The goal is to calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote while adhering to the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears.

The program computes `min_lemon` as the minimum of:
- `a` (number of lemons available)
- `b // 2` (the number of apples divided by 2, since each lemon requires 2 apples)
- `c // 4` (the number of pears divided by 4, since each lemon requires 4 pears)

Then, it calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as:
- `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`

This is logically correct because:
- If `min_lemon` lemons are used, then `2 * min_lemon` apples and `4 * min_lemon` pears will be used, leading to a total of `min_lemon + 2 * min_lemon + 4 * min_lemon = 7 * min_lemon`.

However, we need to check if there are any edge cases where the program might not work as expected.

### Potential Edge Case:
1. **Case where not enough fruits are available**:
   - Input: `1` (lemons), `1` (apples), `1` (pears)
   - Expected Output: `0` (since you can't make any compote)
   - Actual Output from the program:
     - `min_lemon` will be `min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = min(1, 0, 0) = 0`
     - The output will be `0 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4 = 0`, which is correct.

2. **Case with sufficient fruits but not in the right ratio**:
   - Input: `3` (lemons), `3` (apples), `2` (pears)
   - Expected Output: `0` (not enough pears)
   - Actual Output from the program:
     - `min_lemon` will be `min(3, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(3, 1, 0) = 0`
     - The output will be `0`, which is correct.

3. **Case with maximum values**:
   - Input: `1000` (lemons), `2000` (apples), `4000` (pears)
   - Expected Output: `7000` (using all fruits in the correct ratio)
   - Actual Output from the program:
     - `min_lemon` will be `min(1000, 2000 // 2, 4000 // 4) = min(1000, 1000, 1000) = 1000`
     - The output will be `1000 + 1000 * 2 + 1000 * 4 = 7000`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the program against various potential cases, it consistently produces the expected results according to the problem description. Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
