Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote according to the specified ratio of lemons to apples to pears (1:2:4). 

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and their respective ratios:
   - For every lemon, 2 apples are needed, so `b // 2` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available apples.
   - For every lemon, 4 pears are needed, so `c // 4` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available pears.
   - The minimum of these values (`min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`) ensures that the ratio is maintained without exceeding the available quantities of any fruit.
3. Finally, it computes the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons determined.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, including scenarios where not enough fruits are available to make any compote (resulting in a total of 0). Thus, it adheres to the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible inputs within the specified range.
