Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote in the specified 1:2:4 ratio. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and their required ratios:
   - For every lemon, 2 apples are required, so the number of lemons is limited by `b // 2`.
   - For every lemon, 4 pears are required, so the number of lemons is also limited by `c // 4`.
   - The minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`).
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by multiplying `max_lemons` by their respective ratios (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears), and prints the total.

The program handles edge cases correctly:
- If there are not enough pears (or apples) to make even a single compote, `max_lemons` will be zero, resulting in an output of `0`.
- The constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) ensure that the inputs are always valid positive integers.

Since the program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits for all possible valid inputs, it adheres to the problem description without missing any cases. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
