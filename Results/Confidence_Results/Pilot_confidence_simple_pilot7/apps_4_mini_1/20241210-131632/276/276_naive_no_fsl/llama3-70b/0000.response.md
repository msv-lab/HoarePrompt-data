Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the strings contain leading zeros. In the golden system, leading zeros do not affect the value of the number. However, the current implementation does not account for this, which can lead to incorrect comparisons.

For example, consider the input:
```
00100
11
```
The first number `00100` should be treated as `100`, which has a decimal value of approximately `2.618`, while the second number `11` has a decimal value of approximately `2.618` as well. Thus, they are equal.

However, the program will incorrectly compute the decimal value of `00100` as less than that of `11` because it does not ignore the leading zeros in the first number.

This means that the program fails to handle the edge case of leading zeros correctly, leading to incorrect comparisons.
