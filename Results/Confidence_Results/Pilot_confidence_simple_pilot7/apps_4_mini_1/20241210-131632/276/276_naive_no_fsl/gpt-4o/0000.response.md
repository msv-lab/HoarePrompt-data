Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in the "golden system" notation. 

Here's an explanation of how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two lines of input, each representing a number in the golden system.

2. **Value Calculation**: The function `func_1` computes the decimal value of the given binary string representation using the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). It iterates through each character of the string, and for every '1' encountered, it adds \( q^{(n - i - 1)} \) to the total value, where \( n \) is the length of the string and \( i \) is the current index.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After calculating the decimal values of both input strings, the program compares the two values and prints '>', '<', or '=' based on which value is larger.

The program correctly handles all potential cases:
- It properly calculates the value for any valid binary string consisting of '0's and '1's.
- It ensures that the comparison is done based on the calculated decimal values.

Since I could not identify any edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements or produces incorrect results, I conclude that the program is correct.

Thus, the final output is:
Correctness: **True**
