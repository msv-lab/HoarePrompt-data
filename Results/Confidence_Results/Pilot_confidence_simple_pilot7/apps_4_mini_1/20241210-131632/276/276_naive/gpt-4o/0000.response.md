To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the logic required to compare two numbers in the "golden system" as described in the problem statement.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The input consists of two non-empty strings of '0's and '1's.
2. Each string represents a number in the golden system, where the decimal value is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{value} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n - i}
   \]
   where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
3. The program should output '>', '<', or '=' based on the comparison of the two values.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program correctly reads two strings as input.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that computes the decimal value of a string representation of a number in the golden system.
3. The function iterates through each character of the string, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of \( q \) to the total value.
4. The comparison logic correctly uses the computed values to print the appropriate output.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. The program does not handle leading zeros in the string representation. For example:
   - Input: `00001` and `1` should be treated as equal, but the current implementation does not account for the fact that leading zeros do not affect the value.
   - Input: `00000` and `0` should not be valid as per the problem description (non-empty strings only).
2. The program assumes that the input strings are valid and contain only '0's and '1's. If the input contains any other characters, it would lead to incorrect behavior, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for leading zeros correctly, which can lead to incorrect comparisons. Therefore, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
