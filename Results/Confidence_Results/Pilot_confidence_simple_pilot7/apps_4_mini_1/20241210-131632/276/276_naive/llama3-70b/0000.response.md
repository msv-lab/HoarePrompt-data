To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately compares two binary strings representing numbers in the "golden system" as described.

The key points from the problem description are:
1. The numbers are represented as non-empty strings of '0's and '1's.
2. The decimal value of the strings is calculated using the formula involving \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
3. The output should indicate whether the first number is larger, smaller, or equal to the second number.

Now let's examine the program:

```python
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value of the input string in the golden system by reversing the string and applying the formula for each digit. This seems to be implemented correctly.

2. **Input Handling**: The program expects two lines of input, which it correctly reads and processes.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After calculating the decimal values, the program compares them correctly and prints the appropriate relational operator.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program does not explicitly handle leading zeros. For example, the input `0001` and `1` should be treated as equal. However, both will yield the same decimal value since leading zeros do not affect the computed value in the golden system.

2. **Maximum Length Input**: The program uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate the powers of \( q \). With a string length of 100,000, the precision of floating-point operations may lead to inaccuracies due to the limits of floating-point representation in Python. This could result in incorrect comparisons for very large inputs.

3. **Performance**: The program may also encounter performance issues with very long strings, as the complexity of the computation depends on the length of the strings.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for inaccuracies in floating-point arithmetic when dealing with very large powers of \( q \), there exists a case where the program may not behave as expected. For instance, comparing two long strings that result in very close decimal values might yield incorrect results due to precision errors.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
