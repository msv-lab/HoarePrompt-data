To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and the potential edge cases.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find all positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is determined by the number of times \( n \) can be divided by powers of 5, since trailing zeroes are formed by pairs of 2 and 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s in factorials.

2. **Reviewing the Code**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly counts the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \).
   - The function `func_2(m)` uses binary search to find the range of \( n \) values for which \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.

3. **Potential Problems**:
   - The binary search logic appears to be correct in finding the mid-point and adjusting the search range based on the number of trailing zeroes.
   - However, there is a critical issue regarding the range of numbers being returned. The left boundary is decremented until the trailing zeroes are no longer equal to \( m \), and the right boundary is incremented similarly. This can lead to incorrect results if the boundaries go out of valid ranges or if the boundaries do not correctly capture all values that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( m = 1 \), the output is expected to be the integers from 5 to 9, which is correctly handled.
   - If \( m = 5 \), the output is expected to be 0, which is also handled correctly.
   - However, if we test for \( m = 2 \) or \( m = 3 \), we need to verify if the program returns the correct ranges.
   - For \( m = 2 \), \( 2! = 2 \) has 0 trailing zeroes, \( 3! = 6 \) has 0 trailing zeroes, \( 4! = 24 \) has 0 trailing zeroes, \( 5! = 120 \) has 1 trailing zeroes, and \( 6! = 720 \) has 1 trailing zeroes, \( 7! = 5040 \) has 1 trailing zeroes, \( 8! = 40320 \) has 1 trailing zeroes, and \( 9! = 362880 \) has 1 trailing zeroes. Therefore, there are no \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly 2 trailing zeroes, which is correct.
   - However, for \( m = 3 \), the valid \( n \) should be \( 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 \) because \( 10! \) through \( 14! \) all have exactly 2 trailing zeroes. If the program does not correctly find this range, it will produce incorrect results.

5. **Final Check**: After analyzing the logic and various edge cases, it appears that while the program is structured correctly, it could miss certain values of \( n \) that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes due to the way the boundaries are adjusted. 

Thus, the program does not guarantee correctness for all possible input values of \( m \).

Correctness: **False**.
