To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code in relation to the requirements.

The problem states that Miroslav wants to turn over all skewers with the minimal number of actions. When he turns skewer number `i`, it affects `2k + 1` skewers (including the skewer itself and `k` skewers on either side). 

The provided program defines the function `func_1(n, k)` which calculates the positions of skewers to turn over. It starts from skewer 1 and increments by `2k + 1` with each step, appending the current position to the `positions` list. After finishing the loop, it prints the count and the positions.

Let's evaluate its correctness with some examples:

1. **Example 1**: Input `n = 7`, `k = 2`
   - The affected skewers when turning skewer `1` would be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` (5 skewers in total).
   - Turning skewer `1` will cover skewers `1` to `5`. 
   - The next skewer to turn would be `6`, which covers `5, 6, 7`. 
   - The program outputs `1` and `6`, which is correct because all skewers are turned over.

2. **Example 2**: Input `n = 5`, `k = 1`
   - Turning skewer `1` affects `1, 2, 3`.
   - Turning skewer `4` affects `3, 4, 5`.
   - The program outputs `1` and `4`, which is also correct.

3. **Edge Case**: Input `n = 1`, `k = 0`
   - Turning skewer `1` affects only itself.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

However, the issue arises with the logic of incrementing by `2k + 1`. This approach may leave some skewers unturned in certain configurations, especially when `k` is large relative to `n`. For instance, consider:

- **Test Case**: Input `n = 4`, `k = 2`
  - According to the program, it would turn skewer `1`, which affects skewers `1, 2, 3, 4`. 
  - It would then skip to `3`, but skewer `2` would already be affected. 
  - The program would only output skewer `1`, which is incorrect as it does not minimize the number of turns.

Thus, the program fails to account for cases where turning one skewer might cover others, leading to potentially missed skewers and incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**
