To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have `n` spectators.
   - `k` spectators can stand at any given time.
   - The time `t` is given, and we need to find out how many spectators are standing at that time.

2. **Logic Breakdown**:
   - At time `t`:
     - If `t <= k`: The number of standing spectators is exactly `t` because they are still in the process of standing up.
     - If `t <= n`: The maximum number of spectators standing is `k`, as all `k` spectators will be standing by time `t` if `t` is less than or equal to `n`.
     - If `t > n`: The number of spectators standing will start to decrease as spectators begin to sit down. The number of spectators standing can be calculated as `n + k - t`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - For `t` values from `1` to `k`: The output is `t`, which is correct.
   - For `t` values from `k + 1` to `n`: The output is `k`, which is also correct.
   - For `t` values from `n + 1` to `n + k`: The output is `n + k - t`, which correctly accounts for the spectators sitting down.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary cases:
     - When `t = 1`, it outputs `1`.
     - When `t = k`, it outputs `k`.
     - When `t = n`, it outputs `k` (since all `k` spectators are standing).
     - When `t = n + 1`, it outputs `n - 1` (which is correct as one spectator is now sitting).
     - When `t` reaches `n + k`, it outputs `0` (all spectators are sitting).

5. **Testing with Examples**:
   - Given the examples in the problem description:
     - For `10 5 3`, the output is `3` (correct).
     - For `10 5 7`, the output is `5` (correct).
     - For `10 5 12`, the output is `3` (correct).

After analyzing the logic and testing various potential cases, we find that the program adheres to the problem's requirements and correctly computes the number of standing spectators for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
