To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the program against the requirements.

The problem describes how spectators stand and sit in a Mexican wave pattern. The program is supposed to calculate how many spectators are standing at a given time `t`, given `n` spectators and `k` as the maximum number of spectators that can stand at the same time.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`.
2. **Standing Logic:**
   - If `t <= n`, it prints `min(t, k)`. This means:
     - For times `1` to `k`, the number of standing spectators is equal to `t` (since they are incrementally standing).
     - For times greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k` (since all `k` spectators can stand).
   - If `t > n`, it calculates `k - (t - n) % k`. This aims to determine how many spectators are standing after the wave has started to sit down.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Case where `t = n + k - 1`:**
   - Here, the program will calculate `k - (t - n) % k`.
   - If `k` is less than `n`, this could yield an unexpected result because the wave has already started to sit down, and the calculation might not correctly reflect how many are standing at that precise moment.

2. **Case where `t = n + 1`:**
   - The program should return `k - 1` because at time `t = n + 1`, the last spectator has just sat down, and all the others are still standing.

3. **General Case for `n` and `k`:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where `t` is just after `n`, especially when `t` is greater than `n` but not a multiple of `k`.

### Example Test Case:

- **Input:** `10 5 11`
- **Expected Output:** `4` (since at `t = 11`, the first spectator sits down, leaving 4 standing).
- **Program Output:** The program would calculate `5 - (11 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 1 = 4`, which is correct.

However, if we consider `t = 12`:
- **Input:** `10 5 12`
- **Expected Output:** `3` (since at `t = 12`, the second spectator sits down).
- **Program Output:** The program would calculate `5 - (12 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 2 = 3`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and potential edge cases, it seems that the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description and handles the expected outputs for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the number of standing spectators at any given time `t`, following the rules of the Mexican wave as described.
