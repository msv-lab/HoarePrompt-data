To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

The problem describes a Mexican wave scenario where spectators stand up in a specific order over time. The program needs to calculate how many spectators are standing at a given time `t`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of the following logic:
1. If the time `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the output is simply `t`, which represents the number of spectators who have stood up by that time.
2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the output is `k`, indicating that all `k` spectators are standing.
3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the output is calculated as `n + k - t`, which represents the number of spectators still standing after some have sat down.

### Edge Cases:
1. When `t` is exactly `k`, the output should be `k`, which is handled correctly.
2. When `t` is exactly `n`, the output should be `k`, which is also handled correctly.
3. When `t` is between `n` and `n + k`, the calculation `n + k - t` should correctly yield the number of spectators still standing.

### Testing with Example Cases:
- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, the output is `3`. This is correct.
- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 7`, the output is `5`. This is correct.
- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`, the output is `3`. This is correct.

### Potential Case:
Now let's consider the case when `t` is exactly `n + k`. For example:
- If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 15`, the expected output should be `0` because all spectators would have sat down by that time. However, the program would output `n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 15 = 0`, which is correct.

After analyzing the logic and considering various cases, including edge cases and the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly determines the number of spectators standing at any given time `t`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
