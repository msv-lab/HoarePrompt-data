Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to handle the algorithm that Amr is supposed to follow when navigating the binary tree, which includes the skipping of commands when nodes are revisited and the backtracking when two consecutive commands are skipped.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input case `h = 2` and `n = 3`. According to the problem description, Amr should start at the root (node 1) and navigate to the left (node 2) and then to the right (node 3). The expected number of nodes visited before reaching the exit (node 3) should be 5, as he would visit nodes in the order: 1 (root), 2 (left child), 1 (back to parent), 3 (right child, exit). 

However, the program calculates the answer based only on the value of `n` and does not account for the actual path taken through the tree or the rules about skipping commands and backtracking. The logic used in the program, which involves simple arithmetic based on the value of `n`, does not reflect the traversal process described in the problem.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the specified rules for Amr's navigation in the binary tree.
