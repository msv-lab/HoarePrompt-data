To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and verify if it meets the requirements stated.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) that yield the same minimum LCM, we need to return the smallest \( k \).

### Program Analysis
1. The program first reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
2. It initializes \( k \) to 0 and calculates the initial LCM using `func_2(a, b)`.
3. It then enters a loop where it continuously checks if increasing \( k \) results in a smaller LCM. If it does, it updates the minimum LCM found.
4. The loop breaks when an increase in \( k \) does not yield a smaller LCM.
5. Finally, it prints \( k - 1 \).

### Issues in the Program
- The program prints \( k - 1 \) at the end, but this can lead to incorrect results. For instance, if the smallest \( k \) that gives the minimum LCM is 0, it will print -1, which is incorrect.
- The program may not properly handle cases where the optimal \( k \) is not found due to the nature of the loop. For large values of \( a \) and \( b \), the while loop may run indefinitely or miss the correct \( k \) if it does not find a smaller LCM in consecutive increments.

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
1 2
```
- For \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 2) = 2
- For \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 3) = 6
- For \( k = 2 \): LCM(3, 4) = 12

The smallest LCM occurs at \( k = 0 \), but the program would print \( k - 1 = -1 \), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the output correctly and may not find the correct \( k \) in all cases. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
