Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a while loop to simulate the weight changes of Limak and Bob over the years. Limak's weight is tripled each year, while Bob's weight is doubled. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. 

The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10):

1. **Case with equal weights (a = b)**: The program correctly identifies that Limak will need at least one year to surpass Bob's weight, as shown in the example where both weights are 1. After one year, Limak's weight will be 3 and Bob's weight will be 2, resulting in the correct output of 1.

2. **Case with different weights**: For any input where Limak's weight is less than Bob's, the program will correctly compute the number of years required for Limak to exceed Bob's weight, as demonstrated in the provided examples.

Since the program correctly handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem requirements, it is deemed correct.
