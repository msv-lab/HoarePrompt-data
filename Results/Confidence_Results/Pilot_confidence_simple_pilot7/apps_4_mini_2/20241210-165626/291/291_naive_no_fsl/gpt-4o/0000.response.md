Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide for all cases. 

To illustrate this, consider the case when \( n = 3 \). According to the problem description, Sofia needs to draw 3 squares, which would require drawing 6 segments (2 segments for each square) and using the segments drawn for the first square as guides for the remaining squares. 

However, the program's logic may yield a minimum of 4 segments needed for \( n = 3 \) based on the calculations it performs. Specifically, the function attempts to minimize the number of segments based on the factors of \( n \), but this does not account for the specific geometry of how squares can be drawn adjacent to one another while minimizing the number of initial segments drawn with a ruler. 

Thus, the program fails to handle this case correctly, demonstrating that it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
