291,apps,291_llama3-70b,llama3-70b,gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$).

Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string ""LRLRLRLRL..."" (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means ""go to the left child of the current node"";  Character 'R' means ""go to the right child of the current node"";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?

293,apps,293_gpt-4o,gpt-4o,gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18,"Amr bought a new video game ""Guess Your Way Out!"". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string ""LRLRLRLRL..."" (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means ""go to the left child of the current node"";  Character 'R' means ""go to the right child of the current node"";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.

-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.
