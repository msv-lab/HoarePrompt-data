Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses the `zip` function to pair each element with its next one, and a generator expression to calculate the products.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it:

1. Handles tuples of any length: The function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, which works for tuples of any length, including empty tuples.
2. Handles tuples with duplicate elements: The function correctly calculates the products of consecutive elements, even if they are the same.
3. Handles tuples with negative numbers: The function correctly calculates the products of consecutive elements, even if they are negative.

For example, if the input is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the function returns `(2, 6, 12)`, which is the expected result.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
