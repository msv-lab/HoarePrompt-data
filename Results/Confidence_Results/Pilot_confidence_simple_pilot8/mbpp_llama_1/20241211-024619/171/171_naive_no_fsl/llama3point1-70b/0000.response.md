Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic is correct for all integer inputs, including positive, negative, and zero. For example:

- `func_1(3)` returns `True` because 3 is odd.
- `func_1(4)` returns `False` because 4 is even.
- `func_1(-3)` returns `True` because -3 is odd.
- `func_1(0)` returns `False` because 0 is even.

The function handles all potential cases correctly and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
