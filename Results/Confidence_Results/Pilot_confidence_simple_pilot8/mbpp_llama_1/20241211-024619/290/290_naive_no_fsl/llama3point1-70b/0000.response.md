Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. It splits the input string into words and then checks each word to see if it contains 'z' in any position except the first and last characters. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program correctly splits the input string into words using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over each word and checks if the length of the word is more than 1 character. This is necessary because the problem statement requires 'z' to be present in the middle of the word, not at the start or end.
3. The program uses `word[1:-1]` to exclude the first and last characters of the word when checking for 'z'. This ensures that 'z' is only considered if it is present in the middle of the word.
4. If 'z' is found in the middle of any word, the program immediately returns `True`. If it checks all words without finding 'z' in the middle, it returns `False`.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential case where it does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles words of any length, including single-character words, and it correctly identifies 'z' in the middle of words. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
