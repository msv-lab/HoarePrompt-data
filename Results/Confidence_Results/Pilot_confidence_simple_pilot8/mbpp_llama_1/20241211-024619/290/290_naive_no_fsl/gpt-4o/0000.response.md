Correctness: **True**

The given program checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. It uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string and then checks if 'z' is present in the remaining substring.

The program works correctly for all potential cases:

- If 'z' is present in the middle of the string, it returns True.
- If 'z' is present at the start or end of the string, it returns False.
- If 'z' is not present in the string, it returns False.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` handles strings with different characters and lengths correctly, and it does not contain any obvious logical errors or edge cases that are not handled.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
