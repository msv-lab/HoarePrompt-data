Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The function uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. `s[1:-1]` returns a slice of the string `s`, starting from the second character (index 1) and ending at the second last character (index -1).
2. The `in` operator checks if the character 'z' is present in this sliced string.
3. If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function handles various edge cases correctly:

* If the string is empty or only contains one character, `s[1:-1]` will be an empty string, and the `in` operator will correctly return `False`.
* If the string starts or ends with 'z', `s[1:-1]` will exclude these characters, and the function will only return `True` if 'z' is present in the middle of the string.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness:

* `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string.
* `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
* `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present in the string.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
