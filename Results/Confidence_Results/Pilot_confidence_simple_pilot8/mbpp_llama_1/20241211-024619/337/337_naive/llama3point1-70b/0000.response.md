Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list, and for each element, it checks if the count of that element in the list is equal to 1 using the `count` method. If the count is 1, it includes the element in the sum.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it accurately identifies and sums up the non-repeated elements in the list. It handles empty lists, lists with all unique elements, lists with all repeated elements, and lists with a mix of unique and repeated elements.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, the function will correctly return `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`, which is the sum of the non-repeated elements.

The function's logic is sound, and it does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
