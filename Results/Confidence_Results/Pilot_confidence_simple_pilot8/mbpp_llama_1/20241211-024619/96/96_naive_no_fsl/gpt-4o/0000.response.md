Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The function first checks if the tuple is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` because an empty tuple can be considered to have all elements of the same type (vacuously true).
2. It then determines the type of the first element in the tuple using `type(tup[0])`.
3. The function iterates over each element in the tuple. If it finds an element whose type does not match the type of the first element (`first_type`), it immediately returns `False`.
4. If the function iterates over the entire tuple without finding any elements with a different type, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple have the same type.

This approach correctly handles tuples of any size and with elements of any data type, including mixed types (e.g., integers, floats, strings). The function's logic is straightforward and does not contain any apparent flaws or edge cases that would cause it to fail according to the problem description. 

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including tuples with all elements of the same type and tuples with elements of different types. Without being able to find a counterexample where the function does not behave as expected, we conclude that the function is correct.
