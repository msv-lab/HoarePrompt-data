Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. It does this by first checking if the tuple is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to compare. 

If the tuple is not empty, it determines the data type of the first element and then iterates over the rest of the tuple. If it encounters an element with a different data type, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire tuple without finding any elements with different data types, it returns `True`.

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly handles empty tuples by returning `True`.
- It correctly handles tuples with a single element by returning `True` (because there are no other elements to compare).
- It correctly handles tuples with multiple elements of the same data type by returning `True`.
- It correctly handles tuples with multiple elements of different data types by returning `False`.

The function's logic is sound, and it does not contain any syntax errors or logical fallacies. The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases.
