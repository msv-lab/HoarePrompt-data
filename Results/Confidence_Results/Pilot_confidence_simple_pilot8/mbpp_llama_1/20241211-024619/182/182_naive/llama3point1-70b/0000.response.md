Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last element of the corresponding string in the input tuple. 

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character of each string using `s[-1]`.

This function will work correctly for all possible inputs, including:

- An empty tuple: In this case, the function will return an empty list, which is the expected result.
- A tuple containing strings of different lengths: The function will correctly extract the last character of each string, regardless of its length.
- A tuple containing empty strings: In this case, the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, which is the expected behavior when trying to access an index of an empty string.

However, the program does not include any error handling for the case where the input is not a tuple, or where the tuple contains non-string elements. But based on the problem description, it seems that the input is expected to be a tuple of strings. 

Therefore, assuming that the input will always be a tuple of strings, the program will work correctly for all possible inputs. 

However, to make the function more robust, it would be a good idea to add some error checking code to handle cases where the input is not a tuple, or where the tuple contains non-string elements. 

For example:

```python
def func_1(strings):
    if not isinstance(strings, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a tuple")
    if not all(isinstance(s, str) for s in strings):
        raise TypeError("All elements of the tuple must be strings")
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
```
