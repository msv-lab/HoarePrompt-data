Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and returns a list of the last characters of each string, which is achieved by `s[-1]`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it does not have any conditional statements or loops that could potentially cause it to fail for certain inputs. The list comprehension is a straightforward and efficient way to create a new list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness. For example, `func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers'))` returns `['s', 'r', 's']`, which are indeed the last characters of each string in the tuple.

Additionally, the function will work correctly even if the tuple contains strings of different lengths or if the strings are empty, because `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError` for empty strings, which can be considered as a correct behavior in this context, although it might be desirable to add error handling to deal with such cases.

In general, the function is simple and does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
