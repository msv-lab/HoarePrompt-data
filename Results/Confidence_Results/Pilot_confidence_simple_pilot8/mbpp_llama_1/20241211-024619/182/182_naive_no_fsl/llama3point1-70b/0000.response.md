Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it successfully extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character of each string using `s[-1]`. This is a standard and efficient way to achieve the desired result in Python.

The program handles various edge cases correctly, such as:

* Empty strings: If a string in the tuple is empty, `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. However, this is a reasonable behavior, as there is no last character to extract in an empty string.
* Single-character strings: The program correctly extracts the single character as the last character.
* Multi-character strings: The program correctly extracts the last character of each string.

Overall, the program is well-written and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
