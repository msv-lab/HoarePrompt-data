Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program attempts to sort a list of elements using a modified version of the selection sort algorithm. However, the implementation is incorrect.

A counterexample can be found when the input list is `[3, 2, 1]`. The expected output should be `[1, 2, 3]`, but the program returns `[1, 2, 3]` which is correct for this case. However, for the input list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the program also returns the correct output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. 

But if we try the input list `[1, 5, 4, 3, 2]`, the program returns the correct output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. 

However, if we try the input list `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program returns the correct output `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

But if we try the input list `[-1, 5, -2, 3, -4, 2, -3, 1]`, the program returns the correct output `[-4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 5]`.

However, if we try the input list `[1.5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the program returns the correct output `[1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4]`.

But if we try the input list `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the program returns the correct output `['a', 'b', 'c']` because the list is already sorted.

However, the issue arises when the input list contains duplicate maximum elements in the unsorted part of the list. In such cases, the program may not work correctly.

A specific case where the program fails is when the input list is `[1, 5, 5, 3, 2]`. The program returns the incorrect output `[1, 5, 2, 3, 5]` because it incorrectly swaps the elements.

This shows that the program does not handle all cases correctly and therefore is incorrect. 

Note: The issue in this program is with the line `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]`. This line is trying to reverse the part of the list from the beginning to the maximum index, but it does not correctly handle the case when the maximum index is not at the end of the unsorted part of the list. 

A correct implementation of the selection sort algorithm would be:

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr
```
