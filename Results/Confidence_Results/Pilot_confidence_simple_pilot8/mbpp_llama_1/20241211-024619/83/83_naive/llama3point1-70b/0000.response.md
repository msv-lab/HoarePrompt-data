Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to sort a list of elements using a modified version of the selection sort algorithm. However, the implementation has a flaw. 

The issue lies in the way the program reverses the elements to move the maximum element to its correct position. When the maximum element is not at the beginning of the current unsorted portion of the list, the program reverses the elements from the beginning to the maximum element, and then reverses the entire unsorted portion. This approach can lead to incorrect results because it can swap elements that were already in their correct positions.

For example, consider the list `[3, 2, 1, 4]`. The program will first find the maximum element `4` and move it to the end of the list by reversing the entire list. However, this will result in the list `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is not the correct sorted order.

A correct implementation of the sorting algorithm should only swap the maximum element with the last element of the unsorted portion, without reversing the entire list. 

Therefore, the provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
