Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. The issue lies in the condition `if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, which only checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, but does not guarantee that every pair in the subset is divisible.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: consider the list `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. The program will return `4`, but the subset `[2, 4, 6, 8]` does not satisfy the condition that every pair is divisible, because `6` is not divisible by `4` and `8` is not divisible by `6`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check all pairs of numbers in the subset, not just the pairs where one number is a multiple of the other. 

Here is an example of how the correct code should look like:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len(nums)
    max_size = 1
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        subset = [nums[i] for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(subset)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(subset)):
                if subset[i] % subset[j]!= 0 and subset[j] % subset[i]!= 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            max_size = max(max_size, len(subset))
    return max_size
```
This code generates all possible subsets of the input list and checks each subset to see if every pair of numbers is divisible. If a valid subset is found, its size is compared to the current maximum size, and the maximum size is updated if necessary.
