Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it properly implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is the correct size of the largest subset (since there are no elements).

2. The function then sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. This is necessary because the divisibility check `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` only works if `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `nums[i]`. By sorting the list, we ensure that we're always checking if a larger number is divisible by a smaller number.

3. The function initializes a list `dp` with the same length as `nums`, where each element is initialized to 1. This represents the size of the largest subset ending at each position, with the initial assumption that each number can form a subset of size 1.

4. The function then iterates over the list `nums` and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number `nums[i]` is divisible by the previous number `nums[j]`. If it is, the function updates the size of the largest subset ending at `nums[i]` to be the maximum of its current size and the size of the largest subset ending at `nums[j]` plus 1.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum size of the largest subset found, which is the size of the largest subset of `nums` where every pair is divisible.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program. For example, in the test case `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])`, the largest subset where every pair is divisible is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4. The function correctly returns 4 for this test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible, and it passes all the provided unit tests.
