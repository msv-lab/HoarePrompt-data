Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using a for loop and checks each index. If the index is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the loop without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

This function correctly implements the problem description. It checks every index in the list, and if an odd index contains an even number, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function handles lists of any length and correctly identifies whether every odd index contains an odd number.

Here are some example cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function:

* `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7])` returns `True` because every odd index (1, 3) contains an odd number (3, 7).
* `func_1([1, 4, 5, 7])` returns `False` because the odd index 1 contains an even number 4.
* `func_1([2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the only odd index (1, 3) contains an odd number (3, 5).
* `func_1([])` returns `True` because there are no odd indices to check.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, and I couldn't find any case where the function does not work correctly according to the problem description.
