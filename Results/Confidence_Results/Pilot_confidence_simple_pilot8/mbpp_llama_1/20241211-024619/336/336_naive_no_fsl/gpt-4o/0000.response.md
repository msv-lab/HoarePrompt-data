Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. The function iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if each element at an odd index is odd. If it encounters an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness:

- `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: The odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) contain the numbers 1, 3, 7, 3, which are all odd.
- `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: The odd indices (1) contain the number 1, which is odd.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The odd index (1) contains the number 2, which is even.

The function handles lists of varying lengths and correctly identifies whether the numbers at odd indices are odd or not. The loop iterates over the list with a step size of 2, ensuring that only odd indices are checked. The modulo operator (`%`) is used to determine if a number is odd (i.e., `lst[i] % 2!= 0`) or even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

Given the provided unit tests and the logic implemented in the function, it appears that the program correctly implements the described behavior and handles all potential cases as expected.
