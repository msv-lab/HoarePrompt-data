Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list, starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element (i.e., the elements at odd indices). If it finds an even number at any of these indices, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all the elements at odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

This function works correctly for all possible cases. It correctly handles lists of different lengths, including empty lists (although the function will return `True` for an empty list, as there are no odd indices to check). It also correctly handles lists with both odd and even numbers.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness:

- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because all the numbers at odd indices (1, 3, 7, 3) are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True` because the number at the odd index (1) is odd.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because the number at the odd index (2) is even.

The function's logic is sound, and it handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
