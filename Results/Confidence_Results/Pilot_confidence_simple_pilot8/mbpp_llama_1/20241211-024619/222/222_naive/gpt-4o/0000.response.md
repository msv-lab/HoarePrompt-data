Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program removes all lowercase characters, not substrings. 

For example, if the input string is 'aBCd', the program will return 'BC', which is correct. However, if the input string is 'abCD', the program will return 'CD', which is also correct. But the issue arises when we consider the definition of a substring. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The program does not check for substrings, it simply removes all lowercase characters.

A correct implementation would involve checking all possible substrings of the input string, checking if they are lowercase, and removing them if they are. The provided program does not do this, it simply removes all lowercase characters, which is not the same as removing lowercase substrings.

For instance, the program will not work correctly for the string 'ABCdefGHI', where 'def' is a lowercase substring. The program will return 'ABCGHI', which is correct, but it does not actually remove the substring 'def', it simply removes all lowercase characters. 

However, this example still works as expected, but the issue is that the program is not following the problem description. It's removing all lowercase characters, not substrings. 

A case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description is not found because the problem description is not clear about what to do with overlapping substrings or substrings that are part of other substrings. But the program does not follow the problem description in the sense that it does not check for substrings, it simply removes all lowercase characters. 

A correct implementation according to the problem description would be more complex and would involve checking all possible substrings of the input string. 

So, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description, even though it might work as expected for some cases.
