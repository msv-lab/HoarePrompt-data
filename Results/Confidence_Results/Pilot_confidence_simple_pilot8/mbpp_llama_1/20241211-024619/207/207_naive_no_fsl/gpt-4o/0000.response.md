Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function simply returns the product of the length and width, which is the standard formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

The program includes three assertions to test the function with different inputs, and all of these assertions pass. Additionally, the function does not contain any conditional statements or loops that could potentially cause it to behave incorrectly for certain inputs.

Upon reviewing the code, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for all positive inputs, and it does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws. The function will also work correctly for zero and negative inputs, although the concept of a rectangle with zero or negative length/width may not be meaningful in a geometric context.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
