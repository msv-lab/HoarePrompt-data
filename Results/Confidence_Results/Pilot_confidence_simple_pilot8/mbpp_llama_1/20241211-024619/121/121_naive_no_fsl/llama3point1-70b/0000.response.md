Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime, which is a crucial step in finding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. This function correctly checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

2. The `func_2` function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts with the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is 7, and then checks each subsequent number to see if it's prime and of the form 6k Â± 1. If it is, it increments the count. Once the count reaches n, it returns the corresponding number.

The program handles the base case correctly (when n = 1, it returns 7) and then correctly checks each subsequent number.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider some examples:

- `func_2(1)` returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
- `func_2(2)` returns 11, which is the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
- `func_2(3)` returns 13, which is the third Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

After analyzing the code and testing it with several examples, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
