Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns the angle of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is used to calculate the phase angle of the complex number, which is the angle between the positive real axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number in the complex plane.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Complex numbers with positive and negative real and imaginary parts
- Complex numbers with zero real or imaginary part
- Complex numbers with very large or very small magnitudes

The `cmath.phase` function is a built-in Python function that correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number, taking into account the quadrant in which the complex number lies.

Since the program uses a standard library function to calculate the phase angle and does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled, it appears to be correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
