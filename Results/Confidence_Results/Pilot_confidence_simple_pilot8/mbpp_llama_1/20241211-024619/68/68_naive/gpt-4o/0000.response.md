Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function, which returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. 

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The `cmath.phase` function correctly handles complex numbers with both positive and negative real and imaginary parts, as well as zero.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different cases and the results are within the expected tolerance.

The function correctly handles the following cases:
- Complex numbers with positive real and imaginary parts
- Complex numbers with negative real and imaginary parts
- Complex numbers with zero real or imaginary part
- Complex numbers with both positive and negative real and imaginary parts

Overall, the function appears to be correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
