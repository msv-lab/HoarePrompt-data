Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the angle (or phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. This function takes a complex number as input and returns its phase in radians. The phase of a complex number is the angle it makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane.

The function `func_1` correctly constructs a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts and then uses `cmath.phase` to calculate its phase. This approach is mathematically sound and should work for all complex numbers.

The `cmath.phase` function can handle all complex numbers, including those with zero real part, zero imaginary part, or both. It returns the phase in the range (-π, π], which is the standard range for the phase of a complex number.

Therefore, the function `func_1` should work correctly for all possible inputs, and no cases can be found where it does not meet the problem description. The code correctly implements the calculation of the angle of a complex number, making it a correct solution to the problem.
