Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the expression. The function iterates over each character in the expression, and for each character, it checks if it is an opening bracket. If it is, the function pushes it onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.

The function handles all possible cases correctly:

- It correctly identifies balanced expressions, such as `((()))` or `{[()]}`.
- It correctly identifies unbalanced expressions, such as `((())` or `{[()]}` with an extra closing bracket.
- It correctly handles expressions with multiple types of brackets, such as `({[]})`.
- It correctly handles expressions with no brackets at all, such as `hello world`.
- It correctly handles empty strings, returning `True` as expected.

The function's use of a stack ensures that the order of the brackets is correctly maintained, and the function's checks for empty stacks and mismatched brackets ensure that all possible cases are handled correctly.

Overall, the function is well-designed and correctly implements the logic for checking if an expression is balanced or not. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
