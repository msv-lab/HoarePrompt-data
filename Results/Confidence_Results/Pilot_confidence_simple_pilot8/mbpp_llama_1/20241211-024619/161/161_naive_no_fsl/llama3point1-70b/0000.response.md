Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a function named `func_1` that calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values: 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

The function correctly handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For `n` greater than 1, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next Lucas number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence.

The program correctly implements the Lucas sequence formula and handles all potential cases. It does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it fails to handle. 

For example, `func_1(0)` returns 2, `func_1(1)` returns 1, `func_1(2)` returns 3 (which is 1 + 2), `func_1(3)` returns 4 (which is 3 + 1), and so on. 

The function works correctly for all non-negative integers `n`. It does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, but this is not specified in the problem description. If the problem description required handling these cases, the function would be incorrect. However, based on the provided description, the function is correct.
