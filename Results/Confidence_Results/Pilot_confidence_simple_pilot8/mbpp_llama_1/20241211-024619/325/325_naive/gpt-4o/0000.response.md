Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store the month numbers that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function then checks if the input month is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12. For months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November), the function returns `True`. For months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) and February (which has 28 or 29 days), the function returns `False`.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. The function passes all the tests, which cover different scenarios, including a month with 30 days (June), a month with 28 days (February), and a month with 31 days (December).

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
