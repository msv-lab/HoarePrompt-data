Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input, and it splits the list into sublists every `n`th element. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- `lst[i::n]` is a slice that starts at index `i` and takes every `n`th element from the list `lst`.
- The outer list comprehension `[... for i in range(n)]` generates `n` slices, each starting at a different index from 0 to `n-1`.
- The result is a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`th element from the original list, starting from a different index.

This approach correctly splits the list into sublists every `n`th element, as required by the problem description.

For example, if you call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 3)`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected result.

The function handles edge cases correctly as well. For instance, if `n` is 1, it will return a list containing the original list, which is the expected behavior. If `n` is equal to the length of the list, it will return a list containing the original list, which is also correct.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem.
