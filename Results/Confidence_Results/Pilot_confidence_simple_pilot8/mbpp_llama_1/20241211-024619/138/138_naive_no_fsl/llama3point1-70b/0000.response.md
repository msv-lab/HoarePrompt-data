Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's why the program is correct:

- The `try` block attempts to find the index of the given element in the array using the `index()` method. If the element is found, the function returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element.
- The `except ValueError` block catches the exception raised when the element is not found in the array. In this case, the function returns a tuple with `False` and -1, as specified in the problem description.
- The program handles all potential cases, including when the element is in the array and when it's not. It also handles cases where the array is empty, as the `index()` method will raise a `ValueError` exception in this scenario.
- The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it's not handling. It correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential inputs and cases.
