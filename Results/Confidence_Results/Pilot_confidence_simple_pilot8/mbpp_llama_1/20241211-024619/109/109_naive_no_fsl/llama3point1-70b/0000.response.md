Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the described functionality. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input. If `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2` using slice assignment (`list1[-1:] = list2`). If `list1` is empty, it simply assigns `list2` to `list1`. This logic ensures that the function behaves as expected for all possible input cases.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Non-empty `list1`**: When `list1` is not empty, the slice assignment `list1[-1:] = list2` correctly replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. This is because `list1[-1:]` refers to a slice containing only the last element of `list1`, and assigning `list2` to this slice effectively replaces the last element with the entire `list2`.

2. **Empty `list1`**: When `list1` is empty, the function simply assigns `list2` to `list1`. Although the original problem description asks to replace the last element of `list1` with `list2`, which doesn't apply when `list1` is empty, the provided implementation handles this edge case by effectively treating an empty `list1` as a special case where the entire `list2` becomes the new `list1`. This interpretation aligns with a reasonable extension of the problem's requirements to handle empty lists.

The function's behavior is consistent and correctly implements the intended functionality for all possible input combinations, including empty and non-empty lists for both `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
