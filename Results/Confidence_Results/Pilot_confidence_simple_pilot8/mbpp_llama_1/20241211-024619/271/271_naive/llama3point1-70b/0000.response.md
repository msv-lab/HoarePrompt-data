Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(tuples)` takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. 

Here is a breakdown of how it works:
1. The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuples and groups the corresponding elements from each tuple together. 
2. The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` then calculates the average of each group of corresponding elements.

For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, the `zip(*tuples)` expression will group the elements as `((1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9))`. The list comprehension will then calculate the average of each group, resulting in the output `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`.

This function correctly handles tuples of any length and with any number of inner tuples, as long as all inner tuples have the same length. If the inner tuples have different lengths, the `zip(*tuples)` expression will stop at the end of the shortest tuple, effectively ignoring the extra elements in the longer tuples.

I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
