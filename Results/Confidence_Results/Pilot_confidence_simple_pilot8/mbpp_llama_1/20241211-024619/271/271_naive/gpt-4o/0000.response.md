Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function first determines the number of elements in each tuple by checking the length of the first tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`).
2. It then initializes an empty list `averages` to store the calculated averages.
3. The function iterates over each position in the tuples using a for loop (`for i in range(num_elements)`).
4. For each position, it extracts the elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).
5. It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples (`avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`).
6. The calculated average is then appended to the `averages` list.
7. Finally, the function returns the `averages` list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for different input scenarios.

Since the function correctly implements the described behavior and passes all the provided unit tests, it is considered correct.
