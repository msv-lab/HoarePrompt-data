Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the first `L` elements of the original list, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function returns a tuple with the original list as the first element and an empty list as the second element.
- If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the function returns a tuple with the original list as the first element and an empty list as the second element, because Python's list slicing operation `lst[:L]` does not raise an error when `L` exceeds the list length.
- If `L` is less than the length of the list, the function correctly splits the list into two parts.
- If `L` is 0, the function returns a tuple with an empty list as the first element and the original list as the second element.

In all cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
