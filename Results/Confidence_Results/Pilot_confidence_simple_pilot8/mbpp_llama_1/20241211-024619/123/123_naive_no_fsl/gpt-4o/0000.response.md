Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple of two lists. The first list in the tuple contains the first `L` elements of the input list, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing all elements of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `L` is less than or equal to the length of the input list, the function splits the list into two parts as expected.
* When `L` is greater than the length of the input list, the function returns the entire input list as the first part and an empty list as the second part, which is a reasonable behavior.
* When the input list is empty, the function returns a tuple of two empty lists, which is also a reasonable behavior.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. Since no potential case can be found where the program does not work as expected, the program is correct.
