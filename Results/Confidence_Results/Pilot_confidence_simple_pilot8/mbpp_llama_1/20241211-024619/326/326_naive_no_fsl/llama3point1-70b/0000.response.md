Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the provided function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` and `target`. The `target` parameter is not used in the function, which suggests that the function is not designed to solve the problem as described.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array is empty. In this case, the function will throw an error because it tries to access the length of the array without checking if it is empty.

Additionally, the function name `func_1` does not clearly indicate its purpose, and the variable name `target` is misleading because it is not used in the function.

To fix this, the function should be modified to only take one parameter, the array, and it should include error checking to handle edge cases such as an empty array. 

Here is an example of a corrected version of the function:

```python
def min_difference(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # or any other value to indicate that the array must have at least two elements
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
