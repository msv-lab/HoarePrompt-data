Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. After that, it iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding any such case, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Empty lists: It returns `False` as expected.
- Lists with consecutive numbers: It returns `True` as expected.
- Lists with non-consecutive numbers: It returns `False` as expected.
- Lists with duplicate numbers: It returns `False` as expected, because the presence of duplicates means the numbers are not consecutive.

For example, the function correctly handles the following cases:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive due to the presence of a duplicate.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
