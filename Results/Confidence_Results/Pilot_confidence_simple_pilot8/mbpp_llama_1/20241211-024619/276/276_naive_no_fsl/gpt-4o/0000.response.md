Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function `func_1` takes two lists and their size as input, merges them, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Merging and Sorting**: The code correctly merges the two input lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the merged list using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that all elements from both lists are in ascending order, which is essential for calculating the median.

2. **Median Calculation**: The code checks if the length of the merged list is even or odd and calculates the median accordingly. If the length is even, it takes the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, it takes the middle element as the median. This logic is correct for calculating the median of a sorted list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the problem statement specifies that the lists are of the same size, the code inherently handles cases where the lists might not be of the same size because it calculates the median based on the total length of the merged list, not the individual list sizes. However, since the problem statement guarantees same-sized lists, this aspect does not affect the correctness in the context provided.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with different numbers and the calculation of the median for both even and odd total lengths (when considering the merged list). The function correctly handles these cases, as demonstrated by the assertions.

Given the logic and the test cases, the program appears to correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Without finding a specific case where the program fails to meet the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
