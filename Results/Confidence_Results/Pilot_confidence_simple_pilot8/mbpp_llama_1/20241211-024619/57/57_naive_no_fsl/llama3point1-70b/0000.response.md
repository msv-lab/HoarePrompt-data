Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list, and the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument to sort the strings in each sublist in a case-insensitive way. This means that both uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as equal during the sorting process.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty sublists: The `sorted` function returns an empty list when given an empty list as input, so the program correctly handles empty sublists.
* Sublists with a single element: The `sorted` function returns the original list when given a list with a single element, so the program correctly handles sublists with a single element.
* Sublists with duplicate elements: The `sorted` function is stable, meaning that it preserves the order of equal elements, so the program correctly handles sublists with duplicate elements.
* Sublists with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters: The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, so the program correctly handles sublists with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
