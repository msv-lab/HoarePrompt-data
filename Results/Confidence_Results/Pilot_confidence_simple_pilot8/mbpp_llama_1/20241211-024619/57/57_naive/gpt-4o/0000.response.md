Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and sorts it using the built-in `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that all sublists are sorted, regardless of their length or the content of the strings.

The program handles various edge cases correctly, such as:

* Empty sublists: The `sorted()` function returns an empty list when given an empty list as input, which is the expected behavior.
* Sublists with a single element: The `sorted()` function returns the original list when given a list with a single element, which is the expected behavior.
* Sublists with duplicate elements: The `sorted()` function returns a list with the duplicate elements in sorted order, which is the expected behavior.
* Sublists with strings containing leading or trailing whitespace: The `sorted()` function compares strings lexicographically, which means it considers the whitespace as part of the string. This is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify any special handling for whitespace.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the program's correctness for various inputs. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases that it does not handle, the program is considered correct.
