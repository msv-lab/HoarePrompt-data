Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It does this by using a while loop to repeatedly take the last digit of the number (`n % 10`), add it to the total, and then remove the last digit from the number (`n //= 10`). This process continues until there are no more digits left in the number (`n > 0`).

The function handles non-negative integers correctly, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. For example, `func_1(345)` returns `12` because `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`, and `func_1(12)` returns `3` because `1 + 2 = 3`.

The function also handles the edge case where the input is `0`, in which case it returns `0` because the while loop does not execute when `n` is `0`.

Additionally, the function handles single-digit numbers correctly, as demonstrated by the unit test `func_1(97)` which returns `16` because `9 + 7 = 16`.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
