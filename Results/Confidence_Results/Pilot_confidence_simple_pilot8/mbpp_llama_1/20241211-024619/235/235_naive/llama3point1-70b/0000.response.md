Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It does this by converting the integer into a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting each character back into an integer, and summing them up.

This approach correctly handles all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and zero. It does not have any apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail according to the problem description. 

For example, if `n = 123`, the function will correctly return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. If `n = 0`, it will correctly return `0`. The function is also concise and readable, making it efficient for its intended purpose.

Since the function correctly calculates the sum of digits for any non-negative integer without any apparent flaws or missed edge cases, it is considered correct according to the provided problem description.
