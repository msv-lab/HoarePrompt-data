Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function uses a while loop to iterate over each digit in the input number `n`. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) to the `total` and then removes the last digit from `n` (using `n //= 10`). This process continues until all digits have been processed (i.e., until `n` becomes 0).

The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including single-digit numbers and numbers with multiple digits. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for several examples.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can analyze its behavior for different types of inputs:

* Single-digit numbers: The function correctly returns the number itself, since the sum of a single digit is the digit itself.
* Multi-digit numbers: The function correctly calculates the sum of the digits, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.
* Zero: Although not explicitly tested, the function will correctly return 0 for an input of 0, since the while loop will not execute in this case.

Since we cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
