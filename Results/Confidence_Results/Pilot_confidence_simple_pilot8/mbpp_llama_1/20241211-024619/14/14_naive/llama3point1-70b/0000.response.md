Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate element by comparing the length of the original array with the length of a set created from the array. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements in the original array are automatically removed in the set.

This approach works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty arrays: The function will return `False`, indicating that there are no duplicate elements.
- Arrays with a single element: The function will return `False`, indicating that there are no duplicate elements.
- Arrays with multiple unique elements: The function will return `False`, indicating that there are no duplicate elements.
- Arrays with duplicate elements: The function will return `True`, indicating that there are duplicate elements.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, the function will return `False`, because there are no duplicate elements. If we call `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])`, the function will return `True`, because there are duplicate elements (the number 2 appears twice).

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description and works as expected for all potential cases.
