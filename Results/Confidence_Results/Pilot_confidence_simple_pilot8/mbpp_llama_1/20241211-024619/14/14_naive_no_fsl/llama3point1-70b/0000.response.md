Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. It does this by comparing the length of the original array to the length of a set created from the array. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicates in the original array are automatically removed in the set.

The function works as follows:

1. `set(arr)` creates a set from the array, removing any duplicates.
2. `len(arr)` gets the length of the original array.
3. `len(set(arr))` gets the length of the set (which has no duplicates).
4. `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` checks if the lengths are not equal. If they are not equal, it means there were duplicates in the original array, so the function returns `True`. If they are equal, it means there were no duplicates, so the function returns `False`.

This approach is correct and efficient because it leverages the properties of sets in Python to remove duplicates and then simply compares the sizes of the original array and the set. It handles arrays of any size and correctly identifies the presence or absence of duplicates.

For example, if you call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, it returns `False` because there are no duplicates. If you call `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])`, it returns `True` because there is a duplicate (the number 2).

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly, such as empty arrays, arrays with a single element, or arrays with all elements being the same. For instance, `func_1([])` correctly returns `False` (no duplicates in an empty array), and `func_1([1, 1, 1])` correctly returns `True` (all elements are the same, hence duplicates).
