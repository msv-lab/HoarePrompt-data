Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If the number is even, it is included in the output list.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected output for an empty input list.
- Lists with only odd numbers: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected output since there are no even numbers in the input list.
- Lists with only even numbers: The function will return a list containing all the numbers from the input list, which is the expected output since all numbers in the input list are even.
- Lists with a mix of even and odd numbers: The function will return a list containing only the even numbers from the input list, which is the expected output.
- Lists containing non-integer numbers (e.g., floats): The function will still work correctly, as the modulo operator is defined for floats in Python. However, the concept of even numbers typically applies to integers. If the input list contains floats, the function will return a list of floats where the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, which could be considered as "even" in a broader sense.
- Lists containing non-numeric values: The function will throw an error when it encounters a non-numeric value, because the modulo operator is not defined for non-numeric types. This could be considered a limitation of the function, but it does not make the function incorrect according to the problem description, which implicitly assumes the input list contains numbers.

To make the function more robust, it could include error checking to handle non-numeric values, but based on the provided problem description and assuming the input list contains only numbers, the function is correct.
