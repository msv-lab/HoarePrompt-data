Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a given list of numbers. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If the condition is met, the number is included in the resulting list.

The function handles various test cases correctly, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers (although the latter case is not explicitly tested, the function would return an empty list, which is the expected result).

The code does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. It correctly handles integers and does not rely on any specific properties of the input list, such as its length or the range of values.

In general, the function is concise, readable, and well-structured, making it easy to understand and verify its correctness. Since no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
