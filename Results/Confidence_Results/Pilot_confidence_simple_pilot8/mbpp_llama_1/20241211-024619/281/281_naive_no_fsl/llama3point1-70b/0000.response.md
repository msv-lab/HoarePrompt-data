Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `numbers` and checks each number `num` to see if it is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is 0, then `num` is even and is included in the output list.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is the correct result since there are no numbers to check.
- Lists with only odd numbers: If the input list contains only odd numbers, the function will return an empty list, which is correct because there are no even numbers in the list.
- Lists with only even numbers: If the input list contains only even numbers, the function will return a list of all the numbers in the input list, which is correct.
- Lists with a mix of even and odd numbers: The function will correctly identify and return only the even numbers from the list.
- Lists containing non-integer numbers: The function will still work with lists containing floats or other types of numbers, correctly identifying even numbers based on their integer part (since the modulo operation `%` in Python works with floating-point numbers by performing the operation on the integer part).

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
