Correctness: **True**.

The given program is designed to convert degrees to radians. It uses the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, which is the correct conversion formula. The program implements this formula correctly using the `math.pi` constant for π.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for specific inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees), which further supports the correctness of the program.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function should work correctly for all real number inputs, including positive, negative, and zero degrees. The program does not have any obvious edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
