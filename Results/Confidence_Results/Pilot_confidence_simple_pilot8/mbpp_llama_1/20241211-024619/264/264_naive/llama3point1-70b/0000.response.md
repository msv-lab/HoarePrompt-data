Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The conversion formula used is `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`, which is a standard and correct formula for converting degrees to radians.

The program correctly utilizes the `math` module to access the value of `pi`, ensuring a precise conversion. The function does not include any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, but based on the problem description, it is expected to work with numeric inputs.

The function should work correctly for all numeric inputs, including positive and negative degrees, as well as zero. For example, `func_1(90)` should return `math.pi / 2`, `func_1(-90)` should return `-math.pi / 2`, and `func_1(0)` should return `0`.

Since the program correctly implements the conversion formula and does not have any apparent edge cases that it does not handle, it can be considered correct.
