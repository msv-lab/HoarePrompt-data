Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided code only performs an element-wise bitwise AND operation between the two tuples.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the tuples contain non-integer values. For example, if `tup1 = (1, 'a', 3.0)` and `tup2 = (2, 'b', 4.0)`, the program will throw an error when trying to perform the bitwise AND operation on the string elements.

Additionally, the problem description is unclear about what "extract the elementwise and tuples" means, but based on the provided code, it seems that the intention is to perform some kind of operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, the code only performs a bitwise AND operation, which may not be the intended behavior.

To correctly implement the function, more information about the intended behavior is needed. If the intention is to perform a bitwise AND operation, the function should be modified to handle non-integer values. If the intention is to perform a different operation, the function should be modified accordingly. 

For example, if the intention is to create a new tuple where each element is a tuple containing the corresponding elements from the input tuples, the function could be implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x, y) for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2))
```
