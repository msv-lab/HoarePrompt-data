Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The function works as expected for all the provided test cases. For example, when the tuple is `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element is `10`, the function correctly returns `3`, which is the number of times `10` appears in the tuple.

The function also handles cases where the element is not present in the tuple, returning `0` as expected. For instance, when the tuple is `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element is `4`, the function correctly returns `0`, indicating that `4` does not appear in the tuple.

Since the function uses the built-in `count` method, it is also efficient and handles large tuples correctly. Additionally, the function does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, based on the provided test cases and the implementation of the function, it appears that the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
