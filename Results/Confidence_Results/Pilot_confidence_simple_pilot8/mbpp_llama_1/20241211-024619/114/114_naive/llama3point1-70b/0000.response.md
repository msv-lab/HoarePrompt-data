Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly counts the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. This is because the `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- When the element is present in the tuple multiple times.
- When the element is present in the tuple only once.
- When the element is not present in the tuple.
- When the tuple is empty.
- When the element is of any data type (e.g., integer, string, float).

For example, `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), 2)` returns `2`, `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` returns `0`, and `func_1((), 1)` returns `0`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs and edge cases, it is considered correct.
