Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem. It iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. If a sublist with a higher sum is found, it updates the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist. 

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- When there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns the first one encountered.
- When there is only one sublist, it returns that sublist.
- When the list of lists is empty, it returns an empty list (although this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions).

The use of `float('-inf')` to initialize `max_sum` ensures that the first sublist's sum will always be greater, avoiding potential issues with initial value comparisons. 

Overall, the program is well-structured and correctly implements the required functionality.
