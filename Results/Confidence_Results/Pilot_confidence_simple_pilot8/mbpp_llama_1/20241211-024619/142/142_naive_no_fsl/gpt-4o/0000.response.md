Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function `func_1` iterates over each item in the list, and if it finds an item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any non-matching items, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, including lists with matching and non-matching elements. The function handles these cases correctly, returning `True` when all elements match and `False` otherwise.

Upon examining the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles lists of different lengths and with different data types, and it returns the expected result in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
