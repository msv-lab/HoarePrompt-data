Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the problem description. It attempts to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the input string `s`.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` using the `find` method and stores it in `first_occurrence`.

2. It finds the index of the last occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` using the `rfind` method and stores it in `last_occurrence`.

3. If both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not equal to -1 (indicating that the character was found), it checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it means there is only one occurrence of the character in the string, so it removes this single occurrence using the `replace` method with a count of 1.

4. If `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not equal, it means there are multiple occurrences of the character. In this case, it constructs a new string by concatenating three parts: the substring before the first occurrence, the substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding these occurrences), and the substring after the last occurrence.

5. If either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is -1 (indicating that the character was not found), it simply returns the original string `s`.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- When the character appears only once in the string.
- When the character appears multiple times in the string.
- When the character does not appear in the string.
- When the string is empty or the character is an empty string.

Since the function correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
