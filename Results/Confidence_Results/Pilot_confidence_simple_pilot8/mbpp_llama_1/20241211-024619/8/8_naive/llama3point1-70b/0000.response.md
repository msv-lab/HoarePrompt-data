Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(s, char)` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The function uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to locate the first and last occurrence of the character in the string, respectively.

Here's a breakdown of the function's logic:

1. It finds the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)`.
2. It finds the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(char)`.
3. If both occurrences are found (i.e., `first_occurrence!= -1` and `last_occurrence!= -1`), it checks if they are the same index. If they are the same, it means there is only one occurrence of the character in the string, so it removes that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
4. If the first and last occurrences are different indices, it removes both occurrences by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at the last occurrence), and after the last occurrence.
5. If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `first_occurrence == -1` or `last_occurrence == -1`), it simply returns the original string.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the character appears only once in the string.
* When the character appears multiple times in the string.
* When the character does not appear in the string at all.
* When the string is empty.

Since the function correctly implements the required logic and handles all edge cases, it is considered correct.
