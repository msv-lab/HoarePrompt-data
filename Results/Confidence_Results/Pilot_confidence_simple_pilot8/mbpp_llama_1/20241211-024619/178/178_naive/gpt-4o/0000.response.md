Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer using the `round` function, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. 

The function handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as integers and floating-point numbers, correctly rounding them according to the `round` function's rules. The unit tests provided also confirm the function's correctness for various input scenarios.

Given the function's straightforward implementation and the lack of any obvious edge cases that it does not handle, it appears to be correct for all potential inputs. The function does not have any conditional statements or loops that could lead to incorrect results based on the input values, and the `round` function and `sum` function are standard Python functions that behave as expected. 

Therefore, without being able to find a specific case where the function does not work as expected, the conclusion is that the function is correct.
