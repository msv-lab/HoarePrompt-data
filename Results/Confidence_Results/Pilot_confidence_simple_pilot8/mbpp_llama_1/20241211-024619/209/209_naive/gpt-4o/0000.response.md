Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to extract the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and retrieve the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios, including sublists of different lengths. The function's implementation is straightforward and effectively handles the extraction of the first element from each sublist.

Upon examining the code, it appears that the function will work correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Empty sublists: Although not explicitly tested, the function will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access the first element of an empty sublist. However, this behavior is consistent with the expected outcome, as there is no first element to retrieve from an empty list.
* Sublists with a single element: The function correctly returns the single element as the first element of the sublist.
* Sublists with multiple elements: The function correctly returns the first element of each sublist, regardless of the sublist's length.

Given the simplicity and clarity of the function's implementation, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for all potential input cases. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
