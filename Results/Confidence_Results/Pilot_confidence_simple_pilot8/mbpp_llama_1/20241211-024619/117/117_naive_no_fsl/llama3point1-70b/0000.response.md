Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance` function. The `sum` function then adds up the boolean values returned by `isinstance`, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

This function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists containing only integers
* Lists containing only non-integer elements
* Lists containing a mix of integer and non-integer elements
* Empty lists

For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns 3, `func_1([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])` returns 0, `func_1([1, 2.0, 3])` returns 2, and `func_1([])` returns 0. 

Since the function works as expected for all possible cases, its correctness is confirmed.
