Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`. If the element is an integer, it counts as 1; otherwise, it counts as 0. The `sum` function then adds up all these counts to give the total number of integer elements in the list.

The function handles various cases correctly, including lists with a mix of integers, floats, and strings, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. It correctly identifies and counts only the integer elements, ignoring non-integer elements.

Since the function accurately implements the described behavior for all potential cases that can be conceived, and there are no apparent edge cases or inputs for which the function would not work as expected, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
