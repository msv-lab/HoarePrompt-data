Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance` function. The `sum` function then adds up the boolean values (where `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0) to give the total count of integer elements.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Lists containing only integers
* Lists containing only non-integer elements
* Lists containing a mix of integer and non-integer elements
* Empty lists

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 'a', 3, 4.5, 5])`, it correctly returns `3`, because there are three integer elements in the list: `1`, `2`, and `5`. Similarly, if we call `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'])`, it correctly returns `0`, because there are no integer elements in the list. 

The function also handles edge cases such as an empty list `[]` correctly, returning `0`. 

Therefore, the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
