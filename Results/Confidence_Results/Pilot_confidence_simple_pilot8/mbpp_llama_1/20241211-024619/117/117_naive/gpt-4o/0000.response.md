Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`. If the element is an integer, it contributes 1 to the sum; otherwise, it contributes 0. This approach ensures that the function accurately counts all integer elements in the list, regardless of the presence of non-integer elements.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the function's correctness by covering various scenarios, including lists with a mix of integer and non-integer elements, lists containing only integers, and lists with both integer and floating-point numbers. Since the function passes these tests and its logic aligns with the problem description, it can be concluded that the function works as expected for all potential cases.
