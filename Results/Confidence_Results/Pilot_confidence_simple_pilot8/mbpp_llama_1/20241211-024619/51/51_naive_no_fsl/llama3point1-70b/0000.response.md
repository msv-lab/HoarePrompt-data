Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError because it attempts to divide by the length of the list, which is zero. This is a clear example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program should include a check to handle the case when the input list is empty. For example, it could return a specific value (like None or a custom message) or raise a custom exception to indicate that the operation cannot be performed on an empty list.

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle this case:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate product and divide by length of an empty list")
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

This modification ensures that the function behaves predictably and provides a clear indication of what went wrong when attempting to process an empty list, rather than raising a generic ZeroDivisionError.
