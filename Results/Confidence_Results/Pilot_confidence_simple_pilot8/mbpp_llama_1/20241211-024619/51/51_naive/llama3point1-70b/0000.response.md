Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input list `numbers` is empty. In this case, `len(numbers)` will be 0, and attempting to divide by 0 will raise a ZeroDivisionError. 

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, the program will crash with an error message, rather than returning a meaningful result or handling the edge case in a well-defined way.

Additionally, the program does not check if the input list contains any non-numeric values. If the list contains a non-numeric value, the program will raise a TypeError when it tries to multiply the value with the product.

To fix these issues, the program should add error checking code to handle these edge cases. For example, it could check if the list is empty before attempting to divide by its length, and it could check if all elements in the list are numeric before attempting to multiply them. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0  # or some other meaningful result for an empty list
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("List must only contain numeric values")
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```
