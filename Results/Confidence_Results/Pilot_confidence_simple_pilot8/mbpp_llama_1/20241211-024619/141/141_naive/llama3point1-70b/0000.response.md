Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(n)` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n`, allowing it to iterate over each digit.
2. It then iterates over each digit in `str_n`, checking if the count of that digit in `str_n` is greater than the digit itself (converted to an integer).
3. If it finds a digit where the count exceeds the digit's value, it immediately returns `False`.
4. If it checks all digits without finding any that exceed their own value, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

This function correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It correctly counts the frequency of each digit and compares it to the digit's value, returning the expected result. 

For example, if you input the number 121, the function will correctly return `True` because the frequency of each digit (1 appears twice, and 2 appears once) is less than or equal to the digit itself. If you input the number 122, the function will correctly return `False` because the frequency of the digit 1 (appears twice) is greater than the digit 1 itself.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and implements the problem description as expected, it is considered correct.
