Correctness: **True**

The given program is a simple implementation of a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. It iterates over the sorted list and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Here's why the program is correct:

- If the value is less than all elements in the list, the function will return the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point.
- If the value is greater than or equal to an element in the list, the function will return the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the value, which is the correct insertion point.
- The function handles the case where the list is empty, as it will return 0, which is the correct insertion point for an empty list.

The program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the sorted list, because it uses a single loop to iterate over the list.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True. 

Example use cases:

```python
print(func_1([1, 3, 5, 6], 5))  # Output: 2
print(func_1([1, 3, 5, 6], 2))  # Output: 1
print(func_1([1, 3, 5, 6], 7))  # Output: 4
print(func_1([], 5))  # Output: 0
```
