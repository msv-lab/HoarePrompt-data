Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which is designed to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list to maintain sorted order. This function returns the index where the value should be inserted to the right of any equal elements, which aligns with the problem description.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function works by performing a binary search on the sorted list. It returns the index where the value should be inserted, taking into account the requirement to maintain sorted order. If the value is already present in the list, it returns the index to the right of the last occurrence of the value.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including inserting a value that is greater than all elements in the list, inserting a value that is between existing elements, and inserting a value that is greater than the last element in the list.

Since the `bisect.bisect_right` function is a well-tested and established part of the Python standard library, and the provided unit tests cover various scenarios, it is reasonable to conclude that the function `func_1` is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
