Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a function named `func_1` that takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, representing the rectangular coordinates of a point. The function correctly calculates the polar coordinates of the point using the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radius (`r`) and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle (`phi`) in radians.

The `math.hypot(x, y)` function returns the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, giving the distance of the point from the origin, which is the radius (`r`) in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2(y, x)` function returns the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (`x`, `y`), which is the angle (`phi`) in polar coordinates. The `atan2` function is used instead of `atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero and to get the correct quadrant for the angle.

This function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- Points in all four quadrants.
- Points on the axes (where either `x` or `y` is zero).
- The origin (where both `x` and `y` are zero), in which case `r` is zero and `phi` can be any value, but `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns zero, which is a common convention.

Since the function correctly implements the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates for all possible inputs, it is considered correct.
