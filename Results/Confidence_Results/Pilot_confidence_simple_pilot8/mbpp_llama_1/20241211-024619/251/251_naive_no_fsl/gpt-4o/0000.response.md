Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, representing the rectangular coordinates, and returns a tuple containing the polar coordinates `r` and `theta`.

The calculation of `r` using `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` is correct, as it follows the formula for the magnitude of a vector in a 2D plane. The calculation of `theta` using `math.atan2(y, x)` is also correct, as it takes into account the quadrant of the point `(x, y)` and returns the correct angle in radians.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, and the program handles the conversion correctly for all the test cases.

Additionally, the program correctly handles the case where `x` or `y` is zero, as `math.atan2` returns the correct angle in these cases. For example, `math.atan2(0, 1)` returns 0, and `math.atan2(1, 0)` returns Ï€/2.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
