Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function is used to calculate the angle `theta` in radians, which is the correct approach to handle all four quadrants. The `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` function calculates the radius `r` correctly.

The program handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero, as `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns zero and `math.sqrt(0 ** 2 + 0 ** 2)` returns zero.

Additionally, the program correctly handles negative values of `x` and `y`, as `math.atan2(y, x)` returns the correct angle in radians for all four quadrants.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the program works correctly for various inputs.

Overall, without being able to find a case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
