Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. It then checks if the input month is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are all included in the `months_with_31_days` set.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the program, as they cover various cases, including months with 31 days (e.g., May, January, December) and months without 31 days (e.g., February, June, November).

Since the program correctly handles all possible cases and the unit tests pass, the program is correct. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to produce incorrect results.
