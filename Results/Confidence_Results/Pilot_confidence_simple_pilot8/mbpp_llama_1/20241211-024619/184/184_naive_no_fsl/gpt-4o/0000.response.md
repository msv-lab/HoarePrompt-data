Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. It checks if a number is odd by using the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is true for odd numbers because they leave a remainder when divided by 2.

The program correctly handles various test cases, including lists with both odd and even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers. The function returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list, which aligns with the problem description.

The code is concise, readable, and effectively uses list comprehension to filter the numbers. It does not have any apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, such as handling empty lists, lists with non-integer values, or extremely large numbers. However, based on the provided test cases and the problem description, the function behaves as expected.

For example, the function correctly handles the following cases:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
- `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
- `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Since the function works correctly for all provided test cases and aligns with the problem description, and no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
