Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that filters out even numbers from a given list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (i.e., if the number is odd).

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Lists containing both odd and even numbers
* Lists containing only odd numbers
* Lists containing only even numbers (in which case the function returns an empty list)
* Empty lists (in which case the function returns an empty list)

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, so its correctness is **True**.
