Correctness: **True**

The given program is a function to calculate the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone. 

The provided function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π and the `**` operator for exponentiation. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume.

The provided unit tests using `math.isclose` also suggest that the function is working correctly for different inputs. The `math.isclose` function checks if two numbers are close to each other, allowing for a small relative tolerance due to floating-point precision issues.

After examining the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not work correctly. The function correctly handles positive inputs for radius and height, and the formula is correctly implemented. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

It's worth noting that this function does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values. However, based on the problem description, it appears that the function is intended to work with valid inputs, and it correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone.
