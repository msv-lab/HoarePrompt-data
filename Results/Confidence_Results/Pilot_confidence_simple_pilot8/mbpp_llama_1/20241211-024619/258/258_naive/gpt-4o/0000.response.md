Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given number `n` is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:
1. It converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits `num_len`.
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression within the built-in `sum()` function.
3. It checks if the calculated sum `armstrong_sum` is equal to the original number `n`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(153) == True`, `assert func_1(259) == False`, and `assert func_1(4458) == False` demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs.

After analyzing the function, I couldn't find any potential case where it does not work as expected. The function correctly handles numbers of varying lengths and returns the correct result for both Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
