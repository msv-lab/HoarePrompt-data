Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates over the array in reverse order and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element it encounters, which, due to the reverse iteration, will be the last occurrence in the array.

Here's why this function works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Sorted Array**: The function assumes the input array is sorted. This is crucial because the algorithm relies on the fact that all occurrences of the target element will be grouped together in a sorted array. If the array were not sorted, the function would still work but it would not necessarily find the "last" occurrence in the context of the entire array; it would find the last occurrence in the reverse iteration sequence.

2. **Reverse Iteration**: By iterating over the array in reverse order, the function ensures that the first occurrence of the target element it encounters is the last one in the array. This is efficient because it stops as soon as it finds the target, without needing to examine the entire array unless the target is not present.

3. **Handling Non-existent Target**: If the target element is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as an empty array or an array with a single element correctly. For an empty array, it will simply return `-1` without attempting to access any elements, thus avoiding potential index errors. For an array with a single element, it will correctly identify whether that element matches the target and return its index (0) if it does, or `-1` if it does not.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases and arrays of varying lengths, and it adheres to the problem description by finding the last position of an element in a sorted array, it is considered correct.
