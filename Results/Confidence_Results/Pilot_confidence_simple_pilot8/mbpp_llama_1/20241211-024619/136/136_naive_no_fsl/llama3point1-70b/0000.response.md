Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters a dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. This is achieved through a dictionary comprehension that iterates over each key-value pair `(k, v)` in the dictionary `d` and includes the pair in the resulting dictionary only if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty dictionaries: The function returns an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with all values less than `n`: The function returns an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with all values greater than or equal to `n`: The function returns the original dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with a mix of values less than and greater than or equal to `n`: The function returns a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, which is the expected result.

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs and edge cases, it is considered correct.
