Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

Here's why:

- The function iterates over all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the running sum.
- The `math.comb(n, i)` function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `i` items from a set of `n` items without regard to order.
- The function returns the sum of all even index binomial coefficients after iterating over all possible values of `i`.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as `n = 0` or `n = 1`. For example, when `n = 0`, the function returns `1` (which is the sum of the binomial coefficient at index 0), and when `n = 1`, the function returns `1` (which is the sum of the binomial coefficient at index 0).

Overall, the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
