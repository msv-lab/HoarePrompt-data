Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to add a given tuple to a given list. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple, which is first converted to a list using the `list()` function. 

This approach works correctly for all potential cases, as it handles the addition of tuples of any length to lists of any length. The function returns a new list that includes all elements from the original list, followed by all elements from the tuple.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected results in each case.

The function does not modify the original list or tuple, which is a desirable behavior in many situations. It simply returns a new list that includes all elements from both the original list and the tuple.

Overall, the function is well-designed and works correctly for all potential cases, which is why its correctness is evaluated as **True**.
