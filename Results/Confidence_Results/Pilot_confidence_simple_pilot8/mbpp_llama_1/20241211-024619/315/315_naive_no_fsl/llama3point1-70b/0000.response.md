Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to add the given tuple to the given list, but it actually returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple converted to a list. It does not modify the original list.

For example, if you call `func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5, 6))`, it will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, but the original list `[1, 2, 3]` remains unchanged. If you want to add the tuple to the list in-place, you should use the `extend` method or the `append` method.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.extend(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
Or, if you want to return a new list without modifying the original list:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    # But a more accurate description of this function would be "return a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the input tuple"
```
However, the original function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, so its correctness is **False**.
