Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple converted to a list. 

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it properly handles the addition of the tuple to the list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. The function does not modify the original list, which is a desirable behavior in many cases.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function for several example inputs. The function handles tuples of any length and lists of any length, and it correctly returns a new list that contains all the elements from the original list and the tuple.

In general, this function will work correctly for any input list and tuple, regardless of their lengths or contents. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
