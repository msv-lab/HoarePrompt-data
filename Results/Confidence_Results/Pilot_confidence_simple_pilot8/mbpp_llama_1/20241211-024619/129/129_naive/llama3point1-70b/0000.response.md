Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the ASCII value of a given character. It utilizes the built-in `ord` function in Python, which returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, this function works correctly for all ASCII characters.

The function takes a string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value as an integer. The function does not include any error checking to ensure that the input is a single character. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle cases where the input is not a single character. 

If the input is not a single character (i.e., a string of length greater than 1), the function will still return the ASCII value of the first character in the string, because the `ord` function in Python will throw an error if the string is longer than 1 character. 

For example, if the input is 'ab', the function will throw a `TypeError` because the `ord` function expects a string of length 1. 

However, considering the problem description only asks for the ASCII value of a character, and assuming that the input will always be a single character, the function works correctly in all cases. 

It's worth noting that adding error checking to handle cases where the input is not a single character would make the function more robust. 

For instance:

```python
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the input is not a single character.
    """
    if len(char)!= 1:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a single character")
    return ord(char)
```
