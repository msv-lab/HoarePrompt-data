Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function. The program description states that the function should find the ASCII value of a character.

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The `ord` function in Python returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works as expected for different characters.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling. It correctly handles any single character input, regardless of whether it is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or special character. 

For example, `func_1('a')` would return `97`, `func_1('0')` would return `48`, and `func_1('@')` would return `64`, which are all the correct ASCII values for these characters.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct for every potential case.
