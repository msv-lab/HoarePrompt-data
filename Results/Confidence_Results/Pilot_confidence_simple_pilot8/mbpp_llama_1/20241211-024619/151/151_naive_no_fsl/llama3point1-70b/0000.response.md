Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively traverses the nested list, and for each element, it checks if the element is a list itself. If it is, the function calls itself with this sublist, effectively flattening it and extending the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends it to the `flat_list`.

This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting depth, are eventually added to the `flat_list` in a linear fashion, thus achieving the desired flattening.

To verify its correctness, consider various potential cases:

1. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]`.
2. **Flat List**: If the input is a flat list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return the same list `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. **Nested List**: For a nested list like `[1, [2, 3], 4]`, the function will return a flattened version `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
4. **Deeply Nested List**: The function can handle lists nested to any depth, such as `[1, [2, [3, 4]], 5]`, correctly returning `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
5. **List Containing Different Types**: The function works with lists containing elements of different types, like `[1, 'a', [2, 'b'], 3]`, resulting in `[1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3]`.

Given these examples and the recursive nature of the function, it seems that the program correctly handles all potential cases for flattening a nested list structure, making it correct according to the provided problem description.
