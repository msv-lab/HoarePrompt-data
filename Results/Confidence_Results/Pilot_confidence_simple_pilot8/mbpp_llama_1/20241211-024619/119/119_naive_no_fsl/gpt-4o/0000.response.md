Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function is implemented as `return (b, a)`, where `a` and `b` are the input numbers.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly swaps the order of the input numbers and returns them as a tuple.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function, as they cover different input scenarios and verify that the function returns the expected output.

In general, the function will work correctly for any two input numbers, regardless of their values or data types (as long as they can be stored in variables `a` and `b`). Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
