Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. This is exactly as described in the problem description. 

The function uses a simple and straightforward approach by directly returning a tuple `(b, a)`, where `b` is the second number and `a` is the first number. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all possible input cases, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected results in all cases. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, it can be concluded that the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
