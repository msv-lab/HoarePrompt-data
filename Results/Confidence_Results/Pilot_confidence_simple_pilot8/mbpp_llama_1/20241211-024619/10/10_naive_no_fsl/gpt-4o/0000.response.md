Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is given by `volume = base_area * length`, where `base_area` is the area of the triangular base and `length` is the length of the prism. The area of the triangular base is calculated as `0.5 * base * height`, where `base` is the base of the triangle and `height` is the height of the triangle.

The function `func_1` correctly implements this formula, taking the base, height, and length as input parameters and returning the calculated volume. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function for different input values.

Since the function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism and passes the provided unit tests, it can be concluded that the function is correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
