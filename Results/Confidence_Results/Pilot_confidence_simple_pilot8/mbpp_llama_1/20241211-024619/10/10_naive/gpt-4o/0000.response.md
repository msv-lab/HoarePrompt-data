Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is given by the product of the base area and the length. The base area of a triangle is calculated as half the product of the base and the height.

In the given function, `base_area` is calculated as `0.5 * base * height`, which is the correct formula for the area of a triangle. Then, the volume is calculated as `base_area * length`, which is also correct.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs.

After reviewing the function and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the function does not work as expected. The function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism for all possible inputs, and the unit tests provided further confirm its correctness. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
