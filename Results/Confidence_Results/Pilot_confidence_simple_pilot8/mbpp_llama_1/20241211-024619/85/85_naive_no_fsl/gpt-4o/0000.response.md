Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The program works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions. It then calculates the maximum difference by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array is always obtained by subtracting the smallest element from the largest element. The program handles all possible cases, including arrays with duplicate elements, negative numbers, and arrays with a single element (in which case the maximum difference is 0, but this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions).

The provided assertions also support the correctness of the program, as they cover different scenarios and the program passes all of them. Since we cannot think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
