Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function starts with `idx = 1` and enters a while loop, which continues until it finds a triangular number with `n` or more digits.
2. Inside the loop, it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. It checks if the number of digits in the calculated triangular number is greater than or equal to `n` by converting the number to a string and checking its length.
4. If the condition is met, it returns the current `idx`, which represents the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
5. The loop increments `idx` by 1 in each iteration, ensuring that it checks all possible triangular numbers in ascending order.

The code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It handles all potential cases, including:

- When `n` is 1, it returns the index of the first triangular number (1), which has 1 digit.
- When `n` is greater than 1, it correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

Since the code correctly handles all potential cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
