Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string and a substring as input. It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the string. If the substring is not found, `find` returns -1, and the function returns `None`. If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and its end position (calculated as `start + len(substring) - 1`).

This program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly identifies the occurrence and position of the substring within the string and returns `None` if there is no match.

Here are some example cases to demonstrate the correctness of the program:

* `func_1("hello world", "world")` returns `('world', 6, 10)`, which is correct.
* `func_1("hello world", "foo")` returns `None`, which is correct.
* `func_1("", "foo")` returns `None`, which is correct.
* `func_1("foo", "foo")` returns `('foo', 0, 2)`, which is correct.

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as described. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
