Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start position, and its end position within the `main_string`. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

The program uses the built-in `find` method of Python strings, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns `-1`. The program correctly handles this case by checking if `start_pos` is `-1` and returning `None` if it is.

The end position of the substring is calculated by adding the length of the substring to its start position, which is also correct.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, including cases where the substring is found and where it is not. The function behaves as expected in all these cases.

After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, such as empty strings, substrings at the beginning or end of the main string, and substrings that are not found, it appears that the program handles all these cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
