Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns the occurrence and position of the `sub_string` within the `main_string`. If there is no match, it returns `None`.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It uses the `find` method to get the starting position of the `sub_string` within the `main_string`. If the `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns `-1`.
2. If the `sub_string` is found, it calculates the ending position by adding the length of the `sub_string` to the starting position.
3. It returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, the starting position, and the ending position.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios, including finding the first occurrence of a substring, finding a substring at different positions, and returning `None` when the substring is not found.

The code handles edge cases correctly, such as:

* When the `sub_string` is an empty string, `find` returns `0`, and the function returns the correct result.
* When the `main_string` is an empty string, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None`.
* When the `sub_string` is longer than the `main_string`, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None`.

Overall, the code is well-structured, readable, and correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
