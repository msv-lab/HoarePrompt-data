Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The built-in `tuple()` function in Python is used to convert an iterable (like a list) into a tuple. The function takes a list as an input, converts it to a tuple using `tuple(lst)`, and returns the resulting tuple.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input lists. The function works as expected for lists of different lengths and containing different types of elements (although the problem description and the provided tests only include lists of integers).

There are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. For example, it should work correctly for:

- An empty list: `func_1([])` should return `()`.
- A list with a single element: `func_1([5])` should return `(5,)`.
- A list with duplicate elements: `func_1([2, 2, 3])` should return `(2, 2, 3)`.
- A list with negative numbers or zero: `func_1([-1, 0, 1])` should return `(-1, 0, 1)`.

Given that the function uses the standard `tuple()` conversion and there are no obvious cases where it would fail to meet the problem description, it is considered correct.
