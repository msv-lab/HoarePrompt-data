Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes an input list and returns a tuple version of that list using the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including empty lists, lists containing various data types (such as integers, floats, strings, etc.), and lists containing nested lists or other tuples.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- Converting a list of integers to a tuple: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`.
- Converting an empty list to a tuple: `func_1([])` returns `()`.
- Converting a list containing mixed data types to a tuple: `func_1([1, 'a', 3.14])` returns `(1, 'a', 3.14)`.
- Converting a list containing nested lists to a tuple: `func_1([1, [2, 3], 4])` returns `(1, [2, 3], 4)`.

The function handles all these cases correctly and does not have any apparent edge cases where it would fail to convert a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the function is considered correct for all potential inputs.
