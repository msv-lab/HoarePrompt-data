Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The `tuple()` function in Python is a built-in function that converts an iterable (like a list) into a tuple. The function takes the input list `lst` and returns a tuple version of it.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function. They cover various cases, including lists of different lengths and with different types of elements. Since the function works as expected in all these cases, and given the simplicity and built-in nature of the `tuple()` function, it's reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for all potential inputs.

There are no edge cases that seem to be unhandled by this function. For example, it will correctly handle empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with elements of different data types. It will also work correctly with lists that contain other iterable objects, such as lists or tuples, as elements. 

Therefore, without being able to find a case where the function does not work as expected, the conclusion is that the function is correct.
