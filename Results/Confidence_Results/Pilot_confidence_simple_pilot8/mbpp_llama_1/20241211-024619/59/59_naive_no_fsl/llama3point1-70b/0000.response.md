Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why:

1. The function takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) as input.
2. It concatenates these lists using the `+` operator, resulting in a single list containing all elements from the input lists.
3. The `sorted()` function is then applied to this concatenated list, sorting its elements in ascending order.
4. The sorted list is returned as the result.

This approach works for all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: If any of the input lists are empty, the function will still work correctly, as the `+` operator and `sorted()` function can handle empty lists.
* Lists with duplicate elements: The `sorted()` function will sort the elements correctly, even if there are duplicates.
* Lists with negative numbers or non-integer elements: The `sorted()` function can handle sorting of various data types, including negative numbers and non-integer elements.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output, it is considered correct.
