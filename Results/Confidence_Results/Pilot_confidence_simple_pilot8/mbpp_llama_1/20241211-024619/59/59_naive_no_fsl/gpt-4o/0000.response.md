Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list. 

The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list `combined_list`, and then sorts this combined list using the built-in `sorted` function in Python. The sorted list is then returned.

The program handles various test cases correctly, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with elements in different orders. The `sorted` function in Python is stable and efficient, ensuring that the resulting list is correctly sorted in ascending order.

After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, such as empty lists, lists with negative numbers, or lists with floating-point numbers, it appears that the program would still work correctly in these scenarios. The `sorted` function in Python can handle these cases without any issues.

Therefore, based on the provided code and test cases, it can be concluded that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
