Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. It achieves this by first combining the three input lists into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorting the combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function.

The function works correctly for all the provided test cases, and it also handles cases where the input lists contain duplicate elements or are of different lengths.

The reason why this function is correct is that it correctly implements the problem description. The `sorted()` function in Python returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. By combining the three input lists into a single list and then sorting it, the function ensures that the output list is sorted in ascending order.

Additionally, the function does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. For example, it correctly handles cases where the input lists are empty, or where they contain only a single element.

Overall, based on the provided test cases and the implementation of the function, it appears that the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
