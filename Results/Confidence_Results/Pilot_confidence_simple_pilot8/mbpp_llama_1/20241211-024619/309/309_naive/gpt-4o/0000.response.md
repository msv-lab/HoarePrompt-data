Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same or not. The function correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty, returning `True` as per the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It first checks if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters (none, in this case) are the same.
2. It then stores the first character of the string in the variable `first_char`.
3. The function iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`.
4. If it encounters a character that is different from `first_char`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters are the same.
5. If the function completes the iteration without finding any different characters, it returns `True`, indicating that all characters are the same.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function. The function correctly handles strings with all identical characters (`'aaa'`) and strings with different characters (`'python'` and `'data'`).

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function correctly implements the problem description, and no counterexamples could be found. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
