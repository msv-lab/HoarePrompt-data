Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all the characters in a string `s` are the same or not. It uses a set to store unique characters in the string. If all characters are the same, the set will contain only one character, and its length will be 1.

Here's why the code is correct:

- It handles the case when the string is empty. In this case, `len(set(s))` will be 0, which is not equal to 1, so the function will return `False`, indicating that all characters are not the same (because there are no characters).
- It handles the case when the string contains only one character. In this case, `len(set(s))` will be 1, so the function will return `True`.
- It handles the case when the string contains multiple characters. If all characters are the same, `len(set(s))` will be 1, and the function will return `True`. If not all characters are the same, `len(set(s))` will be greater than 1, and the function will return `False`.

The function works correctly for all possible inputs, including strings with different lengths and containing different characters. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
