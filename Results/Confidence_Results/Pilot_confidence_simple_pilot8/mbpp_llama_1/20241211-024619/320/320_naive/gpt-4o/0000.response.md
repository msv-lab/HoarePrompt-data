Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set, then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order. If there are more than one unique numbers, it returns the second smallest number; otherwise, it returns None.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one unique number in the list (e.g., [2, 2]) or when there are no unique numbers other than the smallest one (e.g., [2, 2, 2]). In these cases, the program returns None as expected.

The program also works correctly for lists with negative numbers and floating-point numbers, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list, or returns None if no such number exists.
