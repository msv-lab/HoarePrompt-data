Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's a breakdown of why it works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Handling duplicates**: The function first converts the input list `nums` to a set `unique_nums` to remove duplicates. This is necessary because the problem asks for the second smallest unique number.

2. **Edge case: Less than two unique numbers**: It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If so, it returns `None`, which is a reasonable response since there's no second smallest number in such a case.

3. **Finding the second smallest number**: It sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`). This correctly identifies the second smallest unique number in the list.

Considering various potential cases:

- **Empty list**: If the input list is empty, `unique_nums` will also be empty, and the function will return `None`, which is correct since there's no second smallest number in an empty list.

- **List with a single element**: If the list contains only one unique number, `unique_nums` will have a length of 1, and the function will return `None`, which is correct.

- **List with two or more unique elements**: The function will correctly identify and return the second smallest unique number.

- **List with duplicate elements**: The function removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, ensuring that it finds the second smallest unique number, not just the second smallest number considering duplicates.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and there's no apparent case where it would fail to meet the problem description, it is considered correct.
