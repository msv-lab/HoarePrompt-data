Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it effectively finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and converts it into a set to remove duplicates. This is stored in `unique_nums`.
2. It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`, which is a reasonable response because there is no second smallest number in a list with less than two unique elements.
3. If there are at least two unique numbers, the function sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order and returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest number.

This approach handles various edge cases correctly, such as:
- An empty list or a list with a single element (returns `None`).
- A list with duplicate elements (ignores duplicates).
- A list with negative numbers or zero (correctly identifies the second smallest number).
- A list with non-integer numbers (works with floats or other numeric types).

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct.
