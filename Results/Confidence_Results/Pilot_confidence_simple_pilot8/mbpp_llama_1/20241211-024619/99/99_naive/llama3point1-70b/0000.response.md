Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string `s`. This is because Python uses zero-based indexing, where the first character is at index 0 (even) and the second character is at index 1 (odd). By using a generator expression with a step size of 2, the function iterates over the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4,...) and joins them together into a new string.

For example, if the input string is "abcdef", the function will return "ace", which are the characters at the even indices (0, 2, 4). This matches the problem description, and the function should work correctly for all input strings.

The key insight here is that the problem description asks to remove characters at odd index values, not characters at odd positions in the string. Since Python indexing starts at 0, the characters at odd indices are actually the second, fourth, sixth, etc. characters in the string, which is what the function correctly removes.
