Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` is designed to remove characters with odd index values from a given string `s`. In Python, indexing starts at 0, which means the first character is at index 0 (even), the second character is at index 1 (odd), and so on.

The function uses a generator expression within the `join()` method to iterate over the characters in the string `s`, but only includes characters where the index `i` is even (i.e., `range(0, len(s), 2)`). This effectively skips characters at odd indices, thus removing them from the resulting string.

For example, if you have the string "abcdef", the indices are as follows:
- 'a' at index 0 (even)
- 'b' at index 1 (odd)
- 'c' at index 2 (even)
- 'd' at index 3 (odd)
- 'e' at index 4 (even)
- 'f' at index 5 (odd)

The function will return "ace", which are the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4).

This logic applies to all possible input strings, regardless of their length or content. Therefore, the function correctly implements the described behavior for every potential case, and no counterexample can be found where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description.
