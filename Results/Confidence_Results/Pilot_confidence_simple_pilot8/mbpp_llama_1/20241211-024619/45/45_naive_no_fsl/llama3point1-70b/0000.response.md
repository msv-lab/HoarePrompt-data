Correctness: **True**

The given Python program checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where each digit is either greater than or less than its adjacent digits, but not equal. The program correctly implements this logic.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to a string to easily access each digit.
2. It initializes a flag `undulating` to `True`, assuming the number is undulating.
3. The program then iterates over each digit in the number (excluding the first and last digits) using a for loop.
4. Inside the loop, it checks two conditions:
   - If the current digit is less than the previous digit and greater than the next digit (`n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]`), or
   - If the current digit is greater than the previous digit and less than the next digit (`n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]`).
   If either of these conditions is true, it means the number is undulating at this point, so it does nothing (`pass`).
5. If neither condition is true, it means the number is not undulating at this point, so it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Finally, it returns the value of `undulating`, indicating whether the number is undulating or not.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including numbers with an odd or even number of digits, and numbers with repeating digits. It also correctly identifies undulating numbers and non-undulating numbers.

For example, the program correctly identifies the numbers 121 and 212 as undulating, and the numbers 123 and 111 as non-undulating. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
