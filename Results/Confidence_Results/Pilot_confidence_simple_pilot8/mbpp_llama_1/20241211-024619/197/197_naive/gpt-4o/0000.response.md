Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It utilizes the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of each element from the list and sums them up.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works:

1. The function takes two parameters: `tup` (the tuple to search in) and `elements` (the list of elements to count).
2. It uses a generator expression to count the occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`.
3. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total count of all elements.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness:

- `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3` because 'a' appears twice and 'b' appears once in the tuple.
- `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6` because 1 appears three times, 4 appears twice, and 7 appears once in the tuple.
- `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2` because 1 and 2 each appear once in the tuple.

After examining the code and considering potential edge cases, it appears that the function correctly handles various inputs, including:

- Empty tuples or lists
- Duplicate elements in the list or tuple
- Elements in the list that do not appear in the tuple

Since no cases were found where the function does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
