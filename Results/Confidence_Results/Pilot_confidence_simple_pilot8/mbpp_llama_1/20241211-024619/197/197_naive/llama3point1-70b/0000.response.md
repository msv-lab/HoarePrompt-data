Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and count its occurrences in the tuple using the `count` method. The `sum` function then adds up these counts to give the total occurrence of all elements in the list.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- When the list and tuple are empty
- When the list and tuple contain duplicate elements
- When the list contains elements that are not present in the tuple
- When the list and tuple contain elements of different data types

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), [2, 2, 4])`, the function will correctly return `3`, which is the total occurrence of `2` in the tuple.

The function does not have any edge cases that it does not handle correctly, and it follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
