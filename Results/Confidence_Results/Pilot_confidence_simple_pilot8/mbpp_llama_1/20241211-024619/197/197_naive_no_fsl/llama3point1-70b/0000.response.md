Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. Here's why:

- The function uses a generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` to iterate over each element in the list `lst`.
- For each element in `lst`, it counts the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple `tup` using the `count` method.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these counts to give the total number of occurrences of all elements of `lst` in `tup`.

This approach works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- When the list `lst` contains elements that are present in the tuple `tup`.
- When the list `lst` contains elements that are not present in the tuple `tup` (in which case `count` will return 0 for those elements).
- When the list `lst` is empty (in which case the function will return 0, since there are no elements to count).
- When the tuple `tup` is empty (in which case the function will return 0, since there are no elements to count).

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
