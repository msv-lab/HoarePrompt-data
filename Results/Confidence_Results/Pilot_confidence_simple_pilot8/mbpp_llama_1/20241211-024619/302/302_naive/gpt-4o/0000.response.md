Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function uses a binary search approach, which is suitable for this problem.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly:

1. The function initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also initializes a `result` variable to -1, which will store the index of the first occurrence of the target number.

2. The function enters a while loop, which continues until `low` is greater than `high`. Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range `[low, high]`.

3. If the value at the midpoint `arr[mid]` is equal to the target number, the function updates the `result` variable with the current `mid` index and adjusts the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This is because the first occurrence of the target number could be to the left of the current midpoint, so the function continues searching in the left half of the range.

4. If the value at the midpoint `arr[mid]` is less than the target number, the function adjusts the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`, effectively searching in the right half of the range.

5. If the value at the midpoint `arr[mid]` is greater than the target number, the function adjusts the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`, effectively searching in the left half of the range.

6. Once the while loop exits, the function returns the `result` variable, which stores the index of the first occurrence of the target number. If the target number is not found, the function returns -1.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various scenarios. The function correctly handles cases where the target number appears multiple times in the array, as well as cases where the target number does not appear at all.

Overall, the function is well-designed and correctly implements a binary search approach to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
