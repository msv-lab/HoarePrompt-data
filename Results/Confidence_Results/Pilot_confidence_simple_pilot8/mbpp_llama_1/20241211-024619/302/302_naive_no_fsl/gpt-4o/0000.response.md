Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a binary search algorithm implementation designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented. It starts by initializing two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
- The `while` loop continues until `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- Inside the loop, the `mid` index is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`. If the element at the `mid` index is equal to the target, the `result` is updated to `mid`, and the `high` pointer is moved to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence on the left side.
- If the element at the `mid` index is less than the target, the `low` pointer is moved to `mid + 1` to search on the right side. Otherwise, the `high` pointer is moved to `mid - 1` to search on the left side.
- Once the loop ends, the `result` is returned, which is the index of the first occurrence of the target element if found, or `-1` if not found.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the target element is not present in the array, or when it is present at the start or end of the array. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the program's correctness in various scenarios.

Overall, the program is a correct implementation of a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
