Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. The issue arises when there are multiple sublists of the same maximum length. According to the problem description, the function should return the list of maximum length, but the given program only returns the first sublist it encounters with the maximum length.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the function will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, which is incorrect because it should return all sublists of maximum length, i.e., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.

To fix this, the function should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```

This version of the function will return a tuple containing the maximum length and a list of all sublists with that length.
