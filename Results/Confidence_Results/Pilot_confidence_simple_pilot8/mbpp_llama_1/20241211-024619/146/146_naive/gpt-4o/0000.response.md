Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It iterates through each list in the list of lists, checks the length of each list, and updates `max_len` and `max_list` whenever it encounters a list with a greater length. The function then returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the corresponding list.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- When there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, it returns the first one it encounters.
- When the input list of lists is empty, it implicitly returns `(0, [])`, although this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions.
- When there is only one list in the list of lists, it correctly returns the length and the list itself.

The provided assertions also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function passes all of them.

However, it's worth noting that if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, the function will return the first one it encounters. If the problem description intended to return all lists with the maximum length, the function would need to be modified to handle this case. But based on the provided assertions and problem description, the function appears to be correct.
