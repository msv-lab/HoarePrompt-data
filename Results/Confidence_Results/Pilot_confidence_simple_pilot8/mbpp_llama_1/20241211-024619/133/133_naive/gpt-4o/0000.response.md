Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. This is achieved through the use of the `zip` function, which pairs corresponding elements from the two tuples, and a generator expression, which calculates the difference between each pair of elements.

The function works as follows:

1. `zip(tup1, tup2)` pairs corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
2. `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` calculates the difference between each pair of elements.
3. `tuple(...)` converts the generator expression into a tuple.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for tuples of any length, as long as they are of the same length. If the tuples are of different lengths, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which is the expected behavior based on the problem description.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, and no edge cases were found where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
