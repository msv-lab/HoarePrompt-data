Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in the input tuples. The function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to calculate the differences.

The function works correctly for tuples of any length, as long as they are of the same length. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop once it reaches the end of the shorter tuple, which is the expected behavior for the `zip` function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. The function handles both positive and negative differences correctly, as well as cases where the differences are zero.

In general, the function is correct because it:

* Uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the two tuples in parallel, which ensures that the corresponding elements are subtracted.
* Uses a generator expression to calculate the differences, which is a concise and efficient way to perform the calculation.
* Returns a new tuple containing the differences, which is the expected output format.

Overall, the function is well-written and correctly implements the described behavior.
