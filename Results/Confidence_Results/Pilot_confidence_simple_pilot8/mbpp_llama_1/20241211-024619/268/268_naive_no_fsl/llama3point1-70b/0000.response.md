Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality. The function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input, and it returns the maximum value in the `n`-th column of the matrix.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

* The function uses a generator expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` to iterate over each row in the matrix and extract the `n`-th element (since Python uses 0-based indexing, we subtract 1 from `n`).
* The `max` function then finds the maximum value among these extracted elements.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Matrices with different numbers of rows and columns
* Matrices with duplicate maximum values in the `n`-th column
* Matrices with negative or non-integer values in the `n`-th column

As long as the input matrix is a list of lists and `n` is a valid column index (i.e., `1 <= n <= number of columns`), the function will return the correct maximum value. If `n` is outside this range, the function will raise an `IndexError`, which is a reasonable behavior given the problem description. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to ensure that the input matrix is well-formed (e.g., that all rows have the same number of columns). If such error checking is required, the function would need to be modified accordingly. But based solely on the provided problem description, the code appears to be correct.
