Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the maximum value of the n'th column in the given matrix. Here's why:

- The function uses a generator expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` to iterate over each row in the matrix and extract the element at the n-1 index (since Python uses 0-based indexing, we subtract 1 from n).
- The built-in `max` function then finds the maximum value among these extracted elements.
- This approach assumes that the matrix is a list of lists where each inner list has at least n elements, and that the elements are comparable (e.g., numbers or strings).

The function handles the problem description correctly for all potential cases, assuming the input matrix is well-formed and the column index n is valid (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ number of columns in the matrix). If the input matrix is not well-formed or n is out of range, the function may raise an exception, but this is not a correctness issue per se, as the problem description does not specify how to handle such edge cases. However, based on the provided code and problem description, the function behaves as expected.
