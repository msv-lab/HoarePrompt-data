Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function works correctly for all non-empty lists of numbers. It handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as floating-point numbers and integers. 

For example, `func_1([5, 2, 9, 1])` will return `1`, which is the smallest number in the list. Similarly, `func_1([-1, 0, 1])` will return `-1`, and `func_1([3.5, 2.2, 1.1])` will return `1.1`.

The function does not contain any explicit error checking, but the `min` function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty, which is a reasonable behavior for this problem. 

Since we cannot think of any case where the function does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
