Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks for divisors of the input number `n` and generates fractions with numerator 1 and denominator as each divisor. However, it does not ensure that the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

A counterexample is when `n = 6`. The program will output:
```
YES
3
1 2
1 3
1 6
```
However, the sum of these fractions is `1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/6 = 5/6`.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when `n` is a prime number. In such cases, the program will output `NO` because it cannot find any divisors of `n`. However, it is possible to find a sequence of fractions that satisfies the given conditions even when `n` is a prime number.

For example, when `n = 7`, a possible sequence of fractions is `1/2, 1/3, 1/6, 1/42`. The sum of these fractions is `1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/42 = 41/42 = 1 - 1/42`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/7 = 6/7`. However, the program will output `NO` for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.
