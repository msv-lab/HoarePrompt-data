Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if `n * m` is divisible by `k`, but it does not consider the case where `n` or `m` is less than `k`. 

For example, if we input `n = 2`, `m = 2`, and `k = 3`, the program will output `NO` because `n * m` is not divisible by `k`. However, the program does not try to find alternative solutions that could satisfy the condition.

Another issue is that the program uses the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`, but it does not use these functions correctly to find the points that satisfy the condition.

The program also does not handle the case where `n` or `m` is 0. In this case, the area of the triangle would be 0, and the program should output `NO`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to handle these edge cases and to correctly use the functions to find the points that satisfy the condition. 

For instance, the program could try to find alternative solutions by checking all possible combinations of points within the given range, or it could use a more efficient algorithm to find the points that satisfy the condition. 

In the given code, the `func_3` is used to find the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `x * n + y * m = gcd(n, m)`. However, this is not used correctly to find the points that satisfy the condition.

The program should be modified to correctly use these functions and to handle the edge cases. 

In addition, the program should be tested with more examples to ensure that it works correctly for all potential cases. 

The given code seems to be incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
