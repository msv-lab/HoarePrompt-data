Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not consider the optimal arrangement of squares to minimize the number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler.

For example, if the input is 3, the program will output 6, but the optimal arrangement is to draw the squares in a 1x3 or 3x1 configuration, which requires only 4 segments to be drawn with a ruler.

The correct approach would be to find the factors of the input number `n` and calculate the minimum number of segments required for each factor. The minimum number of segments would be `2 * (a + b - 2) + 2` for each factor `a` and `b` where `a * b = n`.

Here is a correct implementation in Python:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

min_segments_needed = float('inf')
for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % a == 0:
        b = n // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b - 2) + 2
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)

print(min_segments_needed)
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler for any given input `n`.
