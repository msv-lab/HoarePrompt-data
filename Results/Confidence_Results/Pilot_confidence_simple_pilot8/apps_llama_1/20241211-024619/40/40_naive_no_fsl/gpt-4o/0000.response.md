Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the longest substring that is not a palindrome. 

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the input string or its substrings (obtained by removing the first or last character) are palindromes. However, this approach is not sufficient to find the longest substring that is not a palindrome.

For example, consider the input string "abba". The program will check if "abba" is a palindrome (which it is), then it will check if "bba" is a palindrome (which it is), and then it will check if "abb" is a palindrome (which it is). Since all these checks pass, the program will print 0, indicating that there is no substring that is not a palindrome. However, the substring "ab" is not a palindrome, so the correct output should be 2.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check all possible substrings of the input string and find the longest one that is not a palindrome. The given program does not do this, so it is incorrect. 

Here is a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    def is_palindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]

    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]
            if not is_palindrome(substring):
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```
