Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper needed to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program initializes a set of vowels and a variable `max_jump` to keep track of the maximum jump length.
2. It iterates over the input string, checking each character to see if it's a vowel. If it is, it updates `max_jump` with the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance between the current vowel and the previous vowel (or the start of the string if it's the first vowel).
3. After iterating over the entire string, it updates `max_jump` one last time to account for the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string.
4. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability needed to reach the far end of the string.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty string (not applicable, since the problem statement guarantees a non-empty string)
* A string with no vowels (in this case, `max_jump` would be set to the length of the string, which is the correct minimum jump ability)
* A string with only vowels (in this case, `max_jump` would be set to 1, which is the correct minimum jump ability)

The program also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem statement, such as "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT" and "AAA". Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
