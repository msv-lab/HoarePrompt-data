Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- The program first calculates the minimum number of coins (`min_x`) that each friend must give to Ivan such that the total number of new coins is at least `L`. This is done by dividing `L` by `M` (the number of friends) and rounding up to the nearest integer using the expression `(L + M - 1) // M`.

- Then, it checks if the total number of coins given by all friends (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of coins that Ivan does not have (`N - K`). If this condition is met, it prints `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins that each friend must give to Ivan.

- If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to satisfy all the conditions.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and requirements specified in the problem description. It ensures that each friend gives the same number of coins, all coins given are different, and at least `L` coins are new in Ivan's collection. 

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
