Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It calculates `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure that at least `L` new coins are gifted, considering the worst-case scenario where all friends gift the same coins. This is done using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is equivalent to the ceiling of `L / M`.

2. Then, it checks if it's possible for each friend to gift `min_x` coins without exceeding the total number of different coins (`N`) minus the number of coins Ivan already has (`K`). If `M * min_x` (the total number of coins gifted) is less than or equal to `N - K` (the number of coins Ivan doesn't have), it prints `min_x`.

3. If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy all three conditions.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. It ensures that each friend gifts the same number of coins, all coins gifted are different, and at least `L` coins are new to Ivan's collection. 

The examples provided in the problem description also match the output of the program. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
