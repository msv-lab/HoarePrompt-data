Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It first checks if the number of bits set in the binary representation of `n` is greater than `k`. If it is, the program returns 'No' because it's impossible to find `k` integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals `n`.

If the number of bits set in the binary representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the program then tries to distribute these bits into `k` numbers. It does this by popping the smallest bit, subtracting 1 from it, and appending two copies of the result back into the list. This process is repeated until the list has `k` numbers.

Finally, the program sorts the list in descending order and returns 'Yes' followed by the list of numbers. This approach ensures that the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible and the list is lexicographically largest.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including edge cases such as when `n` is 1 and `k` is 2, or when `n` is 13 and `k` is 2. It also handles cases where `n` is very large and `k` is small, or vice versa.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
