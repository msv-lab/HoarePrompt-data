Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks the conditions specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program starts at the North Pole (latitude 90) and updates the latitude based on the direction of travel. It checks for invalid latitude values (less than -90 or greater than 90) and prints 'NO' if such a value is encountered.

2. The program checks if Limak is at the North Pole (latitude 90) or the South Pole (latitude -90) and ensures that he can only move south from the North Pole and north from the South Pole. If this condition is not met, it prints 'NO'.

3. The program checks if the journey ends at the North Pole (latitude 90) and prints 'YES' if it does, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program handles all the examples provided correctly and there are no obvious edge cases that it does not handle. The use of the latitude value and the conversion of distance to latitude change (using the factor 111.195, which is the approximate number of kilometers per degree of latitude) is correct.

The program's logic is sound and it should work correctly for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
