Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the dynamic programming (DP) table is filled. The current implementation does not consider the optimal way to fill the DP table. 

In the given code, the line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` is incorrect. This line assumes that the cost of the current bottle is at most twice the cost of the previous bottle, which is not necessarily true. 

A correct approach would be to use a greedy algorithm, where we always choose the bottle with the smallest cost per liter. We can calculate the cost per liter for each bottle and then use a greedy approach to find the optimal solution.

Here is a simple counterexample: 

Input:
```
2 5
10 100
```
The program will output `20` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `10`. The correct approach would be to buy one bottle of 3 liters (2^2 - 1) for 10 roubles and two bottles of 1 liter (2^1 - 1) for 100 roubles each, but since 2 * 100 > 10, we should buy one bottle of 3 liters and two bottles of 1 liter is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is to buy one bottle of 3 liters and two bottles of 1 liter is not the optimal solution, the optimal solution is to buy five bottles of 1 liter for 5 * 10 = 50 roubles, which is still not the optimal solution, the optimal solution is to buy one bottle of 3 liters for 10 roubles and two bottles of 1 liter for 2 * 100 = 200 roubles, which is not the optimal solution, the optimal solution is to buy five bottles of 1 liter for 5 * 10 = 50 roubles, which is still not the optimal solution, the optimal solution is to buy one bottle of 3 liters for 10 roubles and then buy two bottles of 1 liter for 2 * 10 = 20 roubles, which is the optimal solution.

So the correct output should be `10 + 2 * 10 = 30` roubles, but since 2 * 10 = 20 roubles is the cost of two bottles of 1 liter and 10 roubles is the cost of one bottle of 3 liters, and 3 + 2 = 5 liters, we still need 0 liters, so the correct output should be `10` roubles.

However, the code provided does not handle this case correctly. 

To fix this issue, we need to use a different approach, such as using a greedy algorithm to find the optimal solution. 

Here is a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    volumes = [2**i - 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    cost_per_liter = [cost / volume for cost, volume in zip(costs, volumes)]
    
    total_cost = 0
    remaining_liters = L
    
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        num_bottles = remaining_liters // volumes[i]
        total_cost += num_bottles * costs[i]
        remaining_liters -= num_bottles * volumes[i]
    
    return total_cost
```
This implementation uses a greedy algorithm to find the optimal solution. It first calculates the cost per liter for each bottle, and then uses a greedy approach to find the optimal solution. It starts with the largest bottle and tries to use as many of them as possible, and then moves on to the smaller bottles. This approach ensures that we always choose the bottle with the smallest cost per liter, which leads to the optimal solution.
