Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The issue lies in the way it calculates the minimum cost. The program tries to use the largest bottles first, but it does not consider all possible combinations of bottles.

For example, if we have three types of bottles with volumes 1, 3, and 7 liters, and costs 10, 20, and 30 roubles respectively, and we need to buy 10 liters of lemonade, the program will choose to buy one 7-liter bottle and three 1-liter bottles, which costs 10 + 3*10 = 40 roubles. However, a better solution would be to buy three 3-liter bottles and one 1-liter bottle, which costs 3*20 + 10 = 70 roubles, but this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution would be to buy one 7-liter bottle and one 3-liter bottle, which costs 30 + 20 = 50 roubles.

This example shows that the program does not always find the minimum cost, and therefore it is incorrect. 

However, if we modify the program to use dynamic programming to consider all possible combinations of bottles, we can find the minimum cost correctly. 

Here is an example of how the modified program could look:

```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            volume = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1
            if i >= volume:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - volume] + costs[j])
    return dp[L]
```

This modified program uses dynamic programming to consider all possible combinations of bottles and find the minimum cost. It initializes a list `dp` of size `L + 1` with infinite values, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy `i` liters of lemonade. It then iterates over each liter from 1 to `L` and for each liter, it iterates over each type of bottle. If the current liter is greater than or equal to the volume of the bottle, it updates `dp[i]` with the minimum of its current value and the cost of buying the bottle plus the minimum cost to buy the remaining liters. Finally, it returns `dp[L]`, which represents the minimum cost to buy `L` liters of lemonade.

With this modification, the program correctly solves the problem for every potential case.
