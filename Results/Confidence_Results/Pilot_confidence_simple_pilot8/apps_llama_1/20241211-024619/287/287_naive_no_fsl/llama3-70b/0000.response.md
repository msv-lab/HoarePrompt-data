Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The program seems to be calculating the number of divisors of `n`, which is not the same as the number of different weights of splits.

For example, when `n = 7`, the program outputs `4`, which is correct. However, when we analyze the program, we can see that it's not actually calculating the weights of splits. It's calculating the number of divisors of `n`, which happens to be the same in this case.

But, if we take `n = 10`, the program will output `4`, because `10` has `4` divisors: `1`, `2`, `5`, and `10`. However, the actual number of different weights of splits of `10` is `5`: `10`, `5+5`, `5+3+2`, `5+2+2+1`, and `2+2+2+2+2`. 

So, the program does not work correctly for all cases. It's just a coincidence that it works for the examples given in the problem description. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to generate all possible splits of `n` and then calculate the weight of each split. The program should then return the number of unique weights. 

Here's a simple example of how this could be done in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    weights = set()
    def split(n, max_val, path):
        if n == 0:
            weights.add(path.count(max_val))
            return
        for i in range(min(max_val, n), 0, -1):
            split(n-i, i, path + [i])
    split(n, n, [])
    print(len(weights))
```
This program generates all possible splits of `n` and calculates the weight of each split. It then returns the number of unique weights.
