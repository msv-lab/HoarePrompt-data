Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The program appears to be counting the number of divisors of `n`, which is not equivalent to the number of different weights of splits.

For example, consider the input `n = 7`. The program will output `4`, but this is not the correct number of different weights of splits. The correct weights are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`, which correspond to the splits `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, respectively.

However, the program is counting the divisors of `7`, which are `1` and `7`. The program is not considering the actual splits of `7` and their corresponding weights.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to generate all possible splits of `n` and count the number of different weights. This can be done using a recursive approach or dynamic programming.

Here's an example of how the correct code might look:

```python
def count_weights(n):
    weights = set()
    def split(n, max_val, current_split):
        if n == 0:
            weights.add(current_split.count(current_split[0]))
        else:
            for i in range(min(max_val, n), 0, -1):
                split(n - i, i, current_split + [i])
    split(n, n, [])
    return len(weights)

n = int(input())
print(count_weights(n))
```

This code generates all possible splits of `n` and counts the number of different weights by storing the weights in a set. The `split` function is a recursive function that generates all possible splits of `n` by trying all possible values from `max_val` down to `1`. The `count_weights` function calls the `split` function and returns the number of different weights.
