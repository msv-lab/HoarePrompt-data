Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits of a given number n. 

The program is actually finding the number of divisors of n, not the number of different weights of splits of n. 

For example, when n = 7, the program will output 4 because 7 has 4 divisors (1, 7), but the correct answer is indeed 4 because the weights of splits of 7 are 1, 2, 3, and 7.

However, when n = 8, the program will output 4 (because 8 has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8), but the correct answer is 5 because the weights of splits of 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (corresponding to the splits [8], [4, 4], [3, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] respectively).

So, the program does not work correctly for all cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

A correct program would need to generate all possible splits of n and count the number of different weights. 

Here is a simple example of how the correct program could look like:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    weights = set()
    def generate_splits(n, current_split, last_num):
        if n == 0:
            weights.add(current_split.count(current_split[0]))
        for i in range(min(last_num, n), 0, -1):
            generate_splits(n - i, current_split + [i], i)
    generate_splits(n, [], n)
    print(len(weights))
```
