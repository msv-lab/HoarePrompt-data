Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. It first reads the number of digits and the base for each number, then reads the digits themselves. It uses a helper function `func_1` to convert each number from its respective base to decimal. The function works by iterating over the digits, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is a standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal.

The program then compares the two decimal numbers and prints the result as '<', '>', or '='.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- Numbers with different numbers of digits
- Numbers with different bases
- Numbers with leading zeroes (although the problem statement guarantees that there will be no leading zeroes, the program would still work correctly if there were)
- Equal numbers

The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It correctly implements the standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal, and it correctly compares the two decimal numbers.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
