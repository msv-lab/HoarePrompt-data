Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The program calculates the values of all 12 expressions and stores them in the list `a`. It then finds the maximum value in the list using the `max()` function and prints the corresponding expression from the list `b`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including cases where the maximum value occurs at the first occurrence in the list. The use of the `index()` method ensures that the program returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value, which corresponds to the smallest index `c` in the problem description.

The program also correctly handles cases where the input values are at the boundaries of the specified range (0.1 to 200.0). The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors that would cause it to produce incorrect results for any valid input.

The provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness, and it is reasonable to conclude that the program will work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
