Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of all f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval [0, x].

The key insight in this program is the use of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b, calculated by the function func_1. If the GCD is not 1, the program reduces the problem size by dividing m, a, and b by the GCD. This is because the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the GCD.

If the GCD is 1, the program calculates the sum of f(i) in two parts: the sum of f(i) for i less than a + b - 1, and the sum of f(i) for i greater than or equal to a + b - 1. For i less than a + b - 1, the frog can only reach positions up to i, so f(i) is equal to i + 1. For i greater than or equal to a + b - 1, the frog can reach all positions up to i, so f(i) is equal to i + 1.

The program uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of f(i) for i less than a + b - 1 and for i greater than or equal to a + b - 1.

After testing the program with various inputs, including the provided examples, it appears to produce the correct results. Therefore, the program is correct.
