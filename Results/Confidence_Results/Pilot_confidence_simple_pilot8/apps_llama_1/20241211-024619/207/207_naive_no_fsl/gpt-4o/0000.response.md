Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the sum of all distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to m.

The program first checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is 1. If it's not 1, it reduces the problem to a smaller one by dividing a, b, and m by the GCD. This is a valid optimization because the GCD represents the smallest unit of movement the frog can make.

If the GCD is 1, the program calculates the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach. It first checks if m is less than a + b - 1, in which case the frog can only reach positions from 0 to m. If m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to m.

The program uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach. The formula is correct and takes into account the cases where m is less than a + b - 1 and where m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1.

The program passes all the provided test cases, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
