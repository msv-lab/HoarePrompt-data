Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to count the number of permutations where the function f(p) is equal to f_max(n), which is the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers 1, 2,..., n. However, the provided program simply calculates the factorial of n-1, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

For example, when n = 3, the program outputs 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4, as there are 4 permutations where f(p) is equal to f_max(3) = 2.

The program does not consider the actual calculation of f(p) and f_max(n), and it does not handle the case where n is greater than 2 correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to calculate f(p) for each permutation and compare it with f_max(n), which requires a more complex approach than simply calculating the factorial of n-1. 

Here is a simple counterexample where the program does not work correctly: 
Input: 3
Expected output: 4
Actual output: 2 

This indicates that the program does not work as expected for all cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
