Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. 

The issue lies in the way `f_max_n` is calculated in `func_2(n)`. The function `func_2(n)` calculates the GCD of all numbers from `1` to `n`, but this is not the correct way to calculate `f_max(n)`. 

`f_max(n)` is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`. To calculate `f_max(n)`, we need to find the maximum number of distinct GCDs that can be obtained from the prefixes of all permutations of `1`, `2`,..., `n`.

A correct approach to calculate `f_max(n)` would be to find the prime factors of `n` and then use these prime factors to construct a permutation that maximizes the number of distinct GCDs.

For example, when `n = 6`, the prime factors are `2` and `3`. A permutation that maximizes the number of distinct GCDs is `[2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1]`, which gives `f(p) = 3`. However, the program calculates `f_max_n` as `1`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
