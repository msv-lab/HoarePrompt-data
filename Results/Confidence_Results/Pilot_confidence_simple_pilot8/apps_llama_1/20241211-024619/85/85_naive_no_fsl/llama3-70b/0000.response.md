Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

The issue lies in the condition inside the if statement. The condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` does not correctly check for the maximum number of nines at the end of the total cost. 

This condition checks if the sum of `i` and `n-i` is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus one. This is not equivalent to checking if the sum ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

For example, when `n = 50`, the program should return `1` because the only pair of shovels with a total cost ending with the maximum possible number of nines is `(49, 50)`. However, the program will not correctly identify this pair.

A correct implementation would involve finding the maximum number of nines that can be at the end of the total cost of two shovels, and then counting the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. 

Here is a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                ans = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```
This program correctly finds the maximum number of nines that can be at the end of the total cost of two shovels, and then counts the number of pairs that achieve this maximum.
