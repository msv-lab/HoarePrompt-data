Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It tries to calculate the maximum number of 9s at the end of the total cost of two shovels by checking if (n + 1) is divisible by 10. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible pairs of shovels.

For example, when n = 10, the program calculates max_9s as 1 and pairs as 11 * 1 = 11, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 0 because there is no pair of shovels whose total cost ends with 1 or more 9s.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels and calculate the total cost of each pair. Then, find the maximum number of 9s at the end of the total cost and count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum.

Here is a correct Python program for the problem:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    max_pairs = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total_cost = i + j
            num_9s = 0
            while total_cost % 10 == 9:
                num_9s += 1
                total_cost //= 10
            if num_9s > max_9s:
                max_9s = num_9s
                max_pairs = 1
            elif num_9s == max_9s:
                max_pairs += 1
    print(max_pairs)
```
This program correctly calculates the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of 9s.
