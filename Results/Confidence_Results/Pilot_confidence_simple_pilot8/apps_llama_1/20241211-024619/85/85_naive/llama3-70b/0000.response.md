Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks pairs of shovels where one shovel's cost is `i` and the other shovel's cost is `n - i`, which is not the correct approach to find all pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels and check if their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: 10

The program will only check pairs (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), and (5, 5), but it will not check other possible pairs like (1, 8) and (2, 7) which also end with one nine.

To fix the program, we need to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels and keep track of the maximum number of nines that can be achieved. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

This program correctly finds the maximum possible number of nines that can be achieved by summing the costs of two shovels and counts the number of pairs that achieve this maximum.
