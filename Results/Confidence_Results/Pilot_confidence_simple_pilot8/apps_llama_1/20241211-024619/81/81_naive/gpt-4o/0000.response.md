Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to be correct. It correctly calculates the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r, where GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The program first checks if y is divisible by x. If not, it returns 0 because GCD(a, b) cannot be x in this case.
2. It then calculates z = y // x, which is used to generate all possible pairs of (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.
3. The program iterates over all possible values of i such that i is a divisor of z. For each i, it calculates a = i * x and b = z // i * x.
4. It checks if both a and b are within the range [l, r] and if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y. If all conditions are met, it increments the count by 1 if a == b, and by 2 if a!= b (because (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different pairs).
5. Finally, the program returns the total count of good pairs.

The code correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where x = y, x = 1, or y = 1. It also correctly counts the number of good pairs, including the cases where a = b and a!= b.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
