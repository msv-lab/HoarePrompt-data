Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the count of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa. 

The issue lies in the conditions used to update the counts. For example, the condition `if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j:` only checks if both cells of the current sofa are to the left of the first cell of the other sofa. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the current sofa is to the left of the other sofa. 

A correct condition would be to check if any cell of the current sofa is to the left of any cell of the other sofa. 

Here's a correct version of the conditions:

```python
if (x1 < x1_j and x1 < x2_j) or (x2 < x1_j and x2 < x2_j):
    right_count[i] += 1
if (x1_j < x1 and x1_j < x2) or (x2_j < x1 and x2_j < x2):
    left_count[i] += 1
if (y1 < y1_j and y1 < y2_j) or (y2 < y1_j and y2 < y2_j):
    bottom_count[i] += 1
if (y1_j < y1 and y1_j < y2) or (y2_j < y1 and y2_j < y2):
    top_count[i] += 1
```

With these corrected conditions, the program should work as expected. 

However, without these corrections, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
