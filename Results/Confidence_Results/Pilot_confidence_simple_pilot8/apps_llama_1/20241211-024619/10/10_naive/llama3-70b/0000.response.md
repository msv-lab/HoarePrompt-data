Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where it only checks if the first cell of the given sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first cell of another sofa. However, according to the problem description, a sofa A is considered to be to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that `x_a < x_b`, a is covered by A, and b is covered by B. This means that the program should check all cells of both sofas, not just the first cell.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
3 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
1 0 0 1
```

In this case, the first sofa has cells (1, 1) and (1, 2), and the second sofa has cells (2, 1) and (2, 2). The program will incorrectly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the first sofa, because it only checks the first cell (1, 1) of the first sofa, and not the second cell (1, 2).

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check all cells of both sofas, not just the first cell. This can be done by iterating over all cells of the given sofa and checking if any cell of another sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the current cell. 

Here is an example of how the `func_1` function could be modified to correctly implement the logic:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            for cell in cells:
                for s_cell in s_cells:
                    if cell[0] < s_cell[0]:
                        left += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[0] > s_cell[0]:
                        right += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] < s_cell[1]:
                        top += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] > s_cell[1]:
                        bottom += 1
                        break
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

However, this modified function still has an issue, because it counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa multiple times. To fix this issue, the function should be modified to only count each sofa once.

Here is an example of how the `func_1` function could be modified to correctly implement the logic and only count each sofa once:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            left_s = False
            right_s = False
            top_s = False
            bottom_s = False
            for cell in cells:
                for s_cell in s_cells:
                    if cell[0] < s_cell[0] and not left_s:
                        left += 1
                        left_s = True
                    elif cell[0] > s_cell[0] and not right_s:
                        right += 1
                        right_s = True
                    elif cell[1] < s_cell[1] and not top_s:
                        top += 1
                        top_s = True
                    elif cell[1] > s_cell[1] and not bottom_s:
                        bottom += 1
                        bottom_s = True
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

This modified function correctly implements the logic and only counts each sofa once.
