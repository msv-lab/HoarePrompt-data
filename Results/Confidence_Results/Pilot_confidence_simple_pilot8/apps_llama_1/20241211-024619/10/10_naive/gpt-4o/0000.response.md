Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the provided code lies in the way it counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. The current implementation only checks if the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the two sofas are in the correct order, but it does not consider the actual positions of the sofas in the storehouse.

For example, consider a storehouse with two sofas: one with coordinates (1, 1, 1, 2) and the other with coordinates (2, 1, 2, 2). The current implementation would count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa, but it would not count the first sofa as being to the left of the second sofa, because the x-coordinates of the first sofa are not less than the x-coordinates of the second sofa.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to correctly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa, taking into account the actual positions of the sofas in the storehouse.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
2
2 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
1 0 0 0
```
In this case, the program should output -1, because there is no sofa that meets the given conditions. However, the program outputs 1, which is incorrect. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all cells of each sofa to determine the correct counts. Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        cells = set([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)])
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            cells_j = set([(x1_j, y1_j), (x2_j, y2_j)])
            if all(x < x_j for x, y in cells for x_j, y_j in cells_j):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if all(x > x_j for x, y in cells for x_j, y_j in cells_j):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if all(y < y_j for x, y in cells for x_j, y_j in cells_j):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if all(y > y_j for x, y in cells for x_j, y_j in cells_j):
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
```
