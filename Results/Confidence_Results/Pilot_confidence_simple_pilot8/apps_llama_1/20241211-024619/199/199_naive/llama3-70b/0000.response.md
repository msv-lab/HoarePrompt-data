Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem statement asks for the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but it's impossible to form a square.

The program uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of lengths `a` and `b` that can be used to form the rectangle. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts equals `n`, and the condition `a!= b` ensures that it's impossible to form a square.

The program correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick by incrementing the `ways` variable whenever it finds a valid combination of `a` and `b`. The use of `range(1, n // 2 + 1)` and `range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)` ensures that the program only considers valid lengths for `a` and `b`, and the condition `a!= b` ensures that the program only counts combinations where `a` and `b` are different.

The program passes all the provided examples, and it's difficult to think of a case where the program would not work correctly. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
