Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It only checks if the two most frequent numbers have a count equal to `n // 2`, but it does not consider other possible combinations of numbers that could also lead to a fair game.

For example, if the input is:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```
The program will print 'NO', but it should also check if there are other pairs of numbers that could lead to a fair game. In this case, Petya and Vasya could choose numbers 1 and 2, or numbers 1 and 3, or numbers 2 and 3, and the game would be fair.

However, the program does not consider these cases because it only checks the two most frequent numbers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should check all possible pairs of numbers and their counts to determine if a fair game is possible. 

Here is a possible correction:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    for num1 in count:
        for num2 in count:
            if num1!= num2 and count[num1] + count[num2] == n and count[num1] == count[num2]:
                print('YES')
                print(num1, num2)
                return
    print('NO')
```
This corrected program checks all possible pairs of numbers and their counts to determine if a fair game is possible. If a pair of numbers is found that satisfies the conditions for a fair game, the program prints 'YES' and the numbers. If no such pair is found, the program prints 'NO'.
