Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is a correct solution to the problem. It iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds a value of `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, it prints that value of `m` and stops.

The `func_1` function is a correct implementation of a primality test. It checks if a number is less than 2 (in which case it's not prime), and then checks if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself by iterating up to the square root of the number.

The program will always find a value of `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, because for any `n`, `n*n + 1` is not a prime number (since it can be factored as `(n+1)(n-1) + 2`, which is not a prime factorization). However, the program doesn't need to rely on this fact, because it simply checks all possible values of `m` until it finds one that works.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `n` is 1 or `n` is a large number. The use of `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` as the upper bound for the loop in `func_1` is an optimization that doesn't affect the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program is a correct and efficient solution to the problem, and it will always produce the correct output for any valid input.
