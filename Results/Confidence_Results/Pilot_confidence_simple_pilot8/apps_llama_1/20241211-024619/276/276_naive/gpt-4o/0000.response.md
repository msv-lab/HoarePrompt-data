Correctness: **True**.

The program provided accurately implements the comparison of two numbers in the "golden system" notation. The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal value of a given number in the golden system by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`, where `q = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`. The main part of the program then compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the correct comparison result.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including numbers of different lengths and numbers with leading zeros. The use of `q ** (n - i - 1)` in the calculation ensures that the powers of `q` are correctly aligned with the digits of the input number.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly calculates the decimal values of `1000` and `111` in the golden system and prints `<` as the comparison result, indicating that the second number is larger.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
