Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the comparison of two numbers in the golden system notation. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number by iterating over each digit and adding the corresponding power of `q` to the total value.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads two input strings `s1` and `s2` representing the two numbers in golden system notation.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of each input string by iterating over each digit and adding the corresponding power of `q` to the total value.
3. The program compares the calculated decimal values of `s1` and `s2` using the `if-elif-else` statement and prints the corresponding comparison result (`>`, `<`, or `=`).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Equal numbers: The program correctly handles cases where the two input numbers are equal, as demonstrated by the example `00100` and `11`.
* Unequal numbers: The program correctly handles cases where the two input numbers are unequal, as demonstrated by the examples `1000` and `111`, and `110` and `101`.
* Numbers with different lengths: The program correctly handles cases where the two input numbers have different lengths, as demonstrated by the example `1000` and `111`.

The program does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. The use of the `**` operator for exponentiation and the `+` operator for addition ensures that the calculations are performed accurately. The comparison of the calculated decimal values using the `if-elif-else` statement ensures that the correct comparison result is printed.

Overall, the program is correct and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
