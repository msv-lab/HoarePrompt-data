Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks to find the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes by placing k fishes in the pond in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)Â·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.

However, the program simply calculates the minimum between k and the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net, and then divides it by the total number of possible positions. This approach does not take into account the optimal placement of fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

For example, if we have a pond of size 3x3, a scoop-net of size 2x2, and 3 fishes to place, the program will output 1.0, which is incorrect. The correct solution is to place the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3), which results in an expected value of 2.0.

A correct solution would involve calculating the expected number of caught fishes for each possible placement of fishes and then returning the maximum expected value. The given program does not implement this approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem. 

The correct code should consider the optimal placement of fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. One possible approach is to place the fishes in a way that maximizes the overlap between the fishes and the scoop-net. This can be achieved by placing the fishes in a grid pattern, with each fish placed at a position that is a multiple of the scoop-net size.

Here is a correct code in python:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = k * ((r**2) / ((n-r+1)*(m-r+1)))
    print(ans)

func()
```
This code calculates the expected number of caught fishes by multiplying the number of fishes by the ratio of the scoop-net size to the total number of possible positions. This approach takes into account the optimal placement of fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.
