Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct for all potential cases. It uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1(n)` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because a trailing zero in `n!` is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5, and since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of factors of 5 determines the number of trailing zeroes.

2. The `func_2(m)` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It starts with a range `[0, 5 * (m + 1)]` and narrows it down until it finds the correct range.

3. Once the correct range is found, the program expands the range to include all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. This is done by checking the numbers to the left and right of the found range until the number of trailing zeroes changes.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `m` is 1, and it also handles cases where there are no numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, in which case it correctly prints 0.

Overall, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases, and it correctly solves the problem as described.
