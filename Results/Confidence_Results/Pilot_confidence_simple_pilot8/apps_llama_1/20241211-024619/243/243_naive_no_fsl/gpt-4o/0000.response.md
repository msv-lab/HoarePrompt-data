Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why:

1. The `func_1(n)` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of factors of 5 in all the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because a trailing zero is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5, and since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of factors of 5 determines the number of trailing zeroes.

2. The `func_2(m)` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It starts with a range `[0, 5 * (m + 1)]` and narrows it down until it finds a number `mid` such that `mid!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

3. Once it finds such a `mid`, it expands the range to the left and right to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

4. The program handles the case where there are no numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes by returning an empty list.

5. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
