Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to maximize the difference between the sums of two sequences `b` and `c` by alternating between adding elements to `b` and `c` in descending order. However, this approach is not optimal.

A counterexample can be found when the input is `3` followed by `1 2 -3`. In this case, the program will output `4` (by choosing `b = [2, 1]` and `c = [-3]`), but the optimal solution is to choose `b = [2, 1, -3]` and `c = []`, resulting in a difference of `0`.

The issue with the program is that it does not consider the case where all elements should be added to sequence `b` to maximize the difference, especially when all elements are positive. A correct solution would involve checking all possible combinations of elements in `b` and `c` to find the maximum difference.

To fix this, a more sophisticated approach would be needed, such as using dynamic programming or recursion to explore all possible partitions of the sequence. The current program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
