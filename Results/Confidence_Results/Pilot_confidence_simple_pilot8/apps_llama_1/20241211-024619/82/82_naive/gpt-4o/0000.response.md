Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the optimal `k` value. The code only iterates over divisors of the difference between `a` and `b`, which is not sufficient to find the optimal `k` value in all cases.

For example, consider the input `a = 4` and `b = 9`. The code will only consider `k` values that are divisors of `5` (i.e., `1` and `5`), but the optimal `k` value is actually `3`, which is not a divisor of `5`. This is because adding `3` to both `a` and `b` results in `7` and `12`, which have a least common multiple of `84`, which is smaller than the least common multiple of `4 + k` and `9 + k` for any other `k` value considered by the code.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for all cases, and its correctness is **False**.
