Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not consider the condition that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. It starts with 0 stones and tries to remove stones when it encounters a '-' operation, which may lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is "3" and the string is "---", the program will output 0, which is correct. However, it does not consider the fact that Vasya had to have at least 3 stones in the pile at the beginning to perform these operations.

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible initial numbers of stones and calculate the final number of stones for each case. The minimum of these final numbers of stones should be the output.

Here's an example of how the correct program could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')
    for initial_stones in range(n + 1):
        stones = initial_stones
        valid = True
        for operation in s:
            if operation == '+':
                stones += 1
            elif operation == '-':
                if stones > 0:
                    stones -= 1
                else:
                    valid = False
                    break
        if valid:
            min_stones = min(min_stones, stones)
    print(min_stones)
```

This program tries all possible initial numbers of stones and checks if it's possible to perform the operations with that initial number of stones. If it's possible, it updates the minimum number of stones. The output is the minimum number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.
