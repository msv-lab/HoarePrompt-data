Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the given operations. 

Here's why:

- The program first counts the number of '-' (minus) operations and '+' (plus) operations in the input string `s`.
- If the number of minus operations is greater than the number of plus operations, it means that Vasya must have started with at least as many stones as the number of minus operations. In this case, the minimum number of stones that can be left in the pile is 0, because Vasya could have started with exactly as many stones as the number of minus operations and ended up with 0 stones after all operations. This is correctly handled by the program.
- If the number of minus operations is not greater than the number of plus operations, it means that Vasya could have started with 0 stones and ended up with `plus_count - minus_count` stones after all operations. This is also correctly handled by the program.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of minus operations is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of plus operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
