Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether Kolya could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's why:

- The program iterates over all possible combinations of buying houses (a) and cars (b) using nested loops. 
- For each combination of houses and cars, it calculates the maximum number of computers (c) that can be bought with the remaining game-coins.
- If the total cost of buying a houses, b cars, and c computers equals the initial game-coin score (n), the program prints 'YES' and exits.
- If the program exhausts all possible combinations without finding a match, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend all of the initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of integer division (//) ensures that the program only considers whole numbers of houses, cars, and computers, as required by the problem description.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when n is 0 or when n is not enough to buy any houses, cars, or computers. In these cases, the program will correctly print 'NO'.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
