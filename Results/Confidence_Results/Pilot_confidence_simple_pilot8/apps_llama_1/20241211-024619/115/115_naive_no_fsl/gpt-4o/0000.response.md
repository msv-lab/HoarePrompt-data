Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It only checks for submatrices of size 2x2 where all elements are 1 in matrix A and performs the operation to set the corresponding elements in matrix B to 1. However, it does not handle cases where a single element in matrix A is 1 and it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix where all elements are 1.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```
In this case, the program will not perform any operations and will return -1, indicating that it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A. However, this is incorrect because it is possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A by performing the operation on the submatrix containing the single 1 element.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should check for all possible submatrices of size 2x2 in matrix A and perform the operation to set the corresponding elements in matrix B to 1 if the submatrix contains at least one 1 element. Additionally, the program should handle cases where a single element in matrix A is 1 and it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix where all elements are 1.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly implement the problem description:
```python
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
```
This modified program checks for all possible submatrices of size 2x2 in matrix A and performs the operation to set the corresponding elements in matrix B to 1 if the submatrix contains at least one 1 element. It also handles cases where a single element in matrix A is 1 and it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix where all elements are 1.
