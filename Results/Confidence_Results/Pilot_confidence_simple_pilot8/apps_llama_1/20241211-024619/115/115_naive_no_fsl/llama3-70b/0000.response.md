Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input matrix A has a single 1 in a 2x2 submatrix. For example, if the input is:

```
3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

The program will output:

```
1
1 1
```

However, this operation will set the top-left 2x2 submatrix of B to 1, which is not equal to A. The correct output should be -1, because it's impossible to make B equal to A.

The issue with the program is that it checks each 2x2 submatrix of A separately and performs an operation if any of the elements in the submatrix are 1. However, this approach does not consider the overall structure of A and can lead to incorrect results. 

A correct approach would be to check if each 1 in A can be covered by a 2x2 submatrix of B, and if not, output -1. If all 1s in A can be covered, then output the sequence of operations to make B equal to A.
