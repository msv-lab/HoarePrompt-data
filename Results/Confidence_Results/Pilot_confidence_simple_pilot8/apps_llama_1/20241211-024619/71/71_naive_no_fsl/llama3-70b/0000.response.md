Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for divisibility by removing digits from the right side of the number. However, the problem statement does not restrict the removal of digits to only the right side. 

For example, if the input is 100 9, the program will output 9, because it tries to remove digits from the right side until it gets a number that is divisible by 10^9. However, the correct output should be 2, because we can remove the digits 1 and 0 to get 0, which is divisible by any number.

A correct approach would be to try all possible combinations of removing digits and check if the resulting number is divisible by 10^k. This would ensure that we find the minimum number of digits to remove to get a number that is divisible by 10^k. 

The given program does not handle this case correctly and therefore, it is incorrect.
