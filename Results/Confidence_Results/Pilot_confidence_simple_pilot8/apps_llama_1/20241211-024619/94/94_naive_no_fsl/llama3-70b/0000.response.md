Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it checks if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The program simply swaps the positions of the empty cells ('X') in the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted lists of characters are equal. This approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual moves that can be made in the puzzle.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:
AB
XC
BX
AC

In this case, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks if the sorted lists of characters are equal after swapping the empty cells, without considering the actual moves that can be made.

The correct approach would be to implement a search algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), to explore all possible moves from the initial configurations of the two puzzles and check if they can reach the same configuration.

The given program does not implement such a search algorithm and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
