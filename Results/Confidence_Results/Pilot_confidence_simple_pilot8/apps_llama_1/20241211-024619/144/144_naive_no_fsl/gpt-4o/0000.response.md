Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. The program first reads the number of elements in the array `n` and the elements themselves `a`.
2. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
3. It initializes the variable `mex` to 1, which represents the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
4. It iterates over the sorted array `a`. For each element `num`, it checks if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. If it is, it increments `mex` by 1. This effectively means that if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, `mex` is not present in the array, so it moves on to the next possible value of `mex`.
5. After iterating over the entire array, `mex` will hold the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.

The program works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly implements the logic of finding the maximum possible value of mex. It handles all edge cases, such as when the array contains duplicate elements or when the array is already sorted.

For example, consider the input `5 1 3 3 3 6`. The program sorts the array to get `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`. It then iterates over the array, incrementing `mex` whenever it encounters an element that is greater than or equal to `mex`. In this case, `mex` will be incremented to 2 (because 1 is present in the array), and then to 3 (because 3 is present in the array), and then to 4 (because 3 is present in the array, but 4 is not), and finally to 5 (because 6 is present in the array, but 5 is not). Therefore, the program correctly outputs `5`, which is the maximum possible value of mex for this array.

Similarly, consider the input `2 2 1`. The program sorts the array to get `[1, 2]`. It then iterates over the array, incrementing `mex` whenever it encounters an element that is greater than or equal to `mex`. In this case, `mex` will be incremented to 2 (because 1 is present in the array), and then to 3 (because 2 is present in the array). Therefore, the program correctly outputs `3`, which is the maximum possible value of mex for this array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic of finding the maximum possible value of mex, and it handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
