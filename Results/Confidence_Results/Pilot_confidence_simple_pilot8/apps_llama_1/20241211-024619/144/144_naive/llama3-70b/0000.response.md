Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations. 

Here's why:

1. The program sorts the input array in ascending order. This is a necessary step because we want to find the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array, and sorting makes it easier to do so.

2. It then initializes a variable `mex` to 1, which represents the minimum positive integer that we are currently checking.

3. The program then iterates over the sorted array. If the current number in the array is equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. This is because we have found a number that is equal to `mex`, so we need to check the next integer.

4. If the current number in the array is greater than `mex`, it breaks out of the loop. This is because we have found a number that is greater than `mex`, which means that `mex` is not present in the array. We can stop checking because we have found the maximum possible value of mex.

5. Finally, the program prints the value of `mex`, which is the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations.

The program works correctly for all possible cases because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of mex. It checks each number in the array and updates `mex` accordingly, and it stops checking as soon as it finds a number that is greater than `mex`. 

For example, if the input array is `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`, the program will correctly output `5` because the maximum possible value of mex is achieved by decreasing the second element to 2 and the fifth element to 4, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`, which has a mex of `5`. 

Similarly, if the input array is `[2, 1]`, the program will correctly output `3` because the maximum possible value of mex is achieved by not decreasing any of the array elements, resulting in the array `[1, 2]`, which has a mex of `3`. 

In general, the program works correctly for all possible cases because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of mex, and it handles all possible edge cases.
