Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, when `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the program calculates `close_both_sides` as the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`. However, this calculation is incorrect.

A correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of operations required to close all tabs to the left of `l` and all tabs to the right of `r`. This can be done by moving the cursor to `l` and closing all tabs to the left, then moving the cursor to `r` and closing all tabs to the right.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input: `6 3 2 4`

The program calculates `move_to_l = 1` and `move_to_r = 1`, and then calculates `close_both_sides = min(1 + (4 - 2 + 2), 1 + (4 - 2 + 2)) = min(5, 5) = 5`. However, this is not the minimum number of operations required.

A correct solution would be to move the cursor to `2` (1 operation), close all tabs to the left (1 operation), move the cursor to `4` (1 operation), and close all tabs to the right (1 operation), for a total of 4 operations.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all cases, and its correctness is **False**. 

One potential correct solution could be implemented using the following Python code:

```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_left = move_to_l + 1
        close_right = move_to_r + 1
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + move_to_r + 2, close_left + close_right)
        print(close_both_sides)

func()
```
