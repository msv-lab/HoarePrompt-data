Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to turn over all skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

- It takes two inputs, `n` and `k`, representing the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step, respectively.
- The `func_1` function generates a list of positions where the skewers should be turned over. It starts from the first skewer and increments the position by `2 * k + 1` each time, effectively turning over every `2 * k + 1` skewers.
- The program then prints the number of positions in the list and the positions themselves.

This approach ensures that all skewers are turned over with the minimal possible number of actions, as required by the problem description. 

For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program will output `2` and `1 6`, indicating that the first and sixth skewers should be turned over. This is consistent with the example provided in the problem description.

Similarly, if `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program will output `2` and `1 4`, which is also consistent with the example provided.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
