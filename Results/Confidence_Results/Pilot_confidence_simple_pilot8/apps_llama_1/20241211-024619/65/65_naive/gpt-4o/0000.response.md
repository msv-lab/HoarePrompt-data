Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It first counts the occurrences of each color in the string, then checks if any color appears more times than there are friends. If such a color exists, it means that at least one friend will have to receive two balloons of the same color, so the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly counts the occurrences of each color in the string.
- It correctly checks if any color appears more times than there are friends.
- It correctly prints 'YES' if all colors appear less than or equal to the number of friends, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program also passes all the provided examples:

- For the input `4 2 aabb`, it correctly prints `YES`.
- For the input `6 3 aacaab`, it correctly prints `NO`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
