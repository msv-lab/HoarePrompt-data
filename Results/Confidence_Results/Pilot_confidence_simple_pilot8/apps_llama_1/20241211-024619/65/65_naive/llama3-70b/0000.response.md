Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the condition `if max_color_count <= k:`. This condition checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. However, this is not sufficient to determine if Kefa can distribute the balloons such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color.

A counterexample is when there are more balloons than friends, but the number of each color is less than or equal to the number of friends. In this case, the program will print 'YES', but it's actually 'NO' because Kefa cannot distribute all the balloons.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
abcde
```
The program will print 'YES', but the correct answer is 'NO' because Kefa has 5 balloons and only 2 friends, so he cannot distribute all the balloons such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the total number of balloons can be distributed among the friends such that each friend gets at most one balloon of each color. This can be done by checking if the number of each color is less than or equal to the number of friends, and also checking if the total number of balloons is less than or equal to the number of friends times the number of colors. 

Here is a correct version of the code:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k and n <= k * len(color_count):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
