Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. It only checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. However, this is not sufficient to determine if all balloons can be distributed without any friend getting two balloons of the same color.

A counterexample is when there are 2 friends and 3 balloons of different colors. In this case, the maximum count of any color is 1, which is less than the number of friends (2). However, it is not possible to distribute all 3 balloons to the 2 friends without one of them getting two balloons of different colors.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the number of unique colors is less than or equal to the number of friends, and also if the total number of balloons can be distributed among the friends such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color.

Here is an example of a correct solution:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    if len(color_count) > k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        for count in color_count.values():
            if count > k:
                print('NO')
                return
        print('YES')
```
This solution first checks if the number of unique colors is greater than the number of friends. If it is, it immediately prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if the count of any color is greater than the number of friends. If it is, it prints 'NO'. If neither condition is met, it prints 'YES'.
