Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The program calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string by counting the number of distinct substrings that can be deleted in one operation.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program starts by initializing the `operations` variable to 1, which represents the first operation to delete the first character of the string.
2. The program then iterates through the string from the second character to the last character.
3. If the current character is different from the previous character, it means that a new distinct substring can be deleted in one operation, so the `operations` variable is incremented by 1.
4. The program finally prints the total number of operations, which represents the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string.

The program works correctly for all the provided examples and also for other potential cases. For example, if the input string is "aaaa", the program correctly outputs 1, because only one operation is needed to delete the whole string. If the input string is "abcd", the program correctly outputs 4, because four operations are needed to delete the whole string.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
