Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem asks for the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$, where in one operation, a contiguous substring of equal letters can be deleted. 

The program works by iterating through the string and incrementing the answer whenever it encounters a letter that is different from the previous one. This effectively counts the number of distinct groups of contiguous equal letters in the string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

For example, consider the string "abaca". The program will count the groups of contiguous equal letters as follows:

- 'a' (1 group)
- 'b' (2 groups)
- 'a' (3 groups)
- 'c' (4 groups)
- 'a' (still 4 groups, because 'a' has been seen before, but it's a new group of 'a's)

However, the program will output 3, which is the correct answer, because it only counts the transitions between different letters, not the total number of groups.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases, including strings with repeated letters and strings with no repeated letters. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
