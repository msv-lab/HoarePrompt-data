Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum volume of kvass that can be left in the kegs after pouring a glass of s liters. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the total volume of all kegs is less than the volume of the glass. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that it's not possible to pour the glass.

2. If the total volume is sufficient, it sorts the volumes of the kegs in ascending order and initializes the minimum keg volume to the smallest keg.

3. It then iterates over the kegs, starting from the smallest one. For each keg, it calculates the maximum amount of kvass that can be taken from the keg without reducing its volume below the minimum keg volume.

4. It subtracts the amount taken from the keg from the remaining volume of the glass. If the remaining volume becomes zero, it breaks out of the loop.

5. If the remaining volume is still greater than zero after the loop, it means that the glass cannot be filled by taking kvass only from the kegs with volumes greater than the minimum keg volume. In this case, it reduces the minimum keg volume by the remaining volume divided by the number of kegs, rounded down.

6. Finally, it prints the minimum keg volume.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the total volume is less than the glass volume, or where the glass volume is greater than the total volume of all kegs except the smallest one.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
