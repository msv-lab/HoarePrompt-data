Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the task of decoding the genome by replacing unrecognized nucleotides ('?') with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') so that the number of nucleotides of each type becomes equal.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program works correctly:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`.
2. It then calculates the average count of each nucleotide type by dividing the length of the genome `n` by 4. This average count is the target count for each nucleotide type.
3. The program then adjusts the count of each nucleotide type by subtracting the current count from the target count. This gives the number of unrecognized nucleotides that need to be replaced with each nucleotide type.
4. The program then iterates through the input string `s` again. When it encounters an unrecognized nucleotide ('?'), it replaces it with the first nucleotide type that has a positive count. The count of that nucleotide type is then decremented.
5. If there are any remaining counts of nucleotide types after replacing all unrecognized nucleotides, the program prints '===' to indicate that it is not possible to decode the genome. Otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the input genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide type appears an equal number of times.
* When the input genome contains unrecognized nucleotides that can be replaced to make each nucleotide type appear an equal number of times.
* When the input genome contains unrecognized nucleotides that cannot be replaced to make each nucleotide type appear an equal number of times, in which case the program prints '==='.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the task as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
