Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why:

- If `x > y + z`, it means that even if all `z` unknown persons downvote, `x` (upvotes) will still be greater than `y + z` (downvotes). So, the only possible result is "+". The program correctly handles this case.

- If `x < y`, it means that even if all `z` unknown persons upvote, `x + z` (upvotes) will still be less than `y` (downvotes). So, the only possible result is "-". The program correctly handles this case.

- If `x == y`, there are two possibilities:
  - If `z == 0`, it means there are no unknown persons. In this case, the result is "0" because the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes. The program correctly handles this case.
  - If `z!= 0`, it means there are unknown persons. Depending on how they vote, the result could be either "+" or "-". The program correctly reports this as uncertain ("?").

- If `x > y` but `x <= y + z`, it means that if all `z` unknown persons downvote, the result could be "0" or "-", but if some or all of them upvote, the result could be "+". The program correctly reports this as uncertain ("?").

The program handles all possible cases correctly, and there are no edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
