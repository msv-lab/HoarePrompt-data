Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately determines the outcome of the voting scenario based on the given inputs. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the unknown votes (`z`) as either all upvotes or all downvotes.
- If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it means that even if all unknown votes are upvotes, the downvotes will still outnumber the upvotes, so the result is definitely "-".
- If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the upvotes will still outnumber the downvotes, so the result is definitely "+".
- In all other cases, the outcome is uncertain because the unknown votes can tip the balance either way, so the result is "?".

This logic covers all possible scenarios and correctly implements the problem description. The program handles edge cases, such as when there are no unknown votes (`z = 0`), and when the number of upvotes or downvotes is zero.

The provided examples in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For input `3 7 0`, the output is indeed "-" because there are more downvotes than upvotes.
- For input `2 0 1`, the output is indeed "+" because even if the unknown vote is a downvote, there are still more upvotes.
- For input `1 1 0`, the output is indeed "0" because the number of upvotes and downvotes is equal.
- For input `0 0 1`, the output is indeed "?" because the outcome is uncertain depending on the unknown vote.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
