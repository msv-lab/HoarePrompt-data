Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if `x` is equal to `y + z` and `z` is not zero, the program will print '?' which is correct. However, if `x` is equal to `y + z - 1` and `z` is not zero, the program will also print '?' which is correct. But if `x` is equal to `y + 1` and `z` is not zero, the program will print '?' which is also correct.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case when `x` is equal to `y + z - 1` and `z` is not zero. In this case, if all `z` unknown persons upvote, the result will be '+', but if all `z` unknown persons downvote, the result will be '-'. So the program should print '?' in this case.

But there is another case where the program does not work correctly. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 1, the program will print '?' which is correct. But if `x` is equal to `y + 1` and `z` is greater than 1, the program will also print '?' which is correct. However, if `x` is equal to `y + z - 1` and `z` is greater than 1, the program will print '?' which is correct.

But if `x` is equal to `y + z - 1` and `z` is 1, the program will print '?' which is correct. But if `x` is equal to `y + 1` and `z` is 1, the program will print '?' which is not correct. In this case, if the unknown person upvotes, the result will be '+', and if the unknown person downvotes, the result will be '0'. So the program should print '?' in this case.

However, there is a case where `x` equals `y + 1` and `z` equals 1. The code will print '?' in this case. But the correct output should be '?' because if the unknown person upvotes, the result will be '+', and if the unknown person downvotes, the result will be '0'. So the code is incorrect.

A correct version of the program would be:
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    elif x == y + z:
        if z == 0:
            print('+')
        else:
            print('?')
    elif x == y + 1:
        if z == 0:
            print('+')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```
Or more simply:
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        print('0')
    elif x + z < y or x > y + z:
        print('-' if x < y else '+')
    else:
        print('?')
```
