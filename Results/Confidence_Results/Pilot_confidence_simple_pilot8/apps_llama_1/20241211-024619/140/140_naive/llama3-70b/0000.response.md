Correctness: **False**

The program provided checks if a graph contains a cycle, but it does not correctly determine if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic. The current implementation only checks if the graph is acyclic, but it does not consider the case where removing one edge can make the graph acyclic.

For example, consider a graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1). This graph contains a cycle. The program will correctly identify that the graph contains a cycle and print 'NO'. However, if we remove the edge (3, 1), the graph becomes acyclic. The program should print 'YES' in this case, but it does not.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check all possible edges that can be removed and verify if the resulting graph is acyclic. If at least one edge can be removed to make the graph acyclic, the program should print 'YES'. Otherwise, it should print 'NO'. 

Here is an example of how the modified program could look like:

```python
def is_acyclic(graph):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
    has_cycle = False
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[node]:
            if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                has_cycle = True
                break
    return not has_cycle

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False

def remove_edge(graph, u, v):
    new_graph = [row[:] for row in graph]
    new_graph[u] = [x for x in new_graph[u] if x!= v]
    return new_graph

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
    edges.append((u, v))

if is_acyclic(graph):
    print('YES')
else:
    for (u, v) in edges:
        new_graph = remove_edge(graph, u, v)
        if is_acyclic(new_graph):
            print('YES')
            break
    else:
        print('NO')
```
This modified program checks all possible edges that can be removed and verifies if the resulting graph is acyclic. If at least one edge can be removed to make the graph acyclic, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
