Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It checks if the given ruler can already measure the distances x and y. If not, it tries to find a single new mark that can be added to measure both distances. If such a mark is found, it prints 1 and the new mark. If not, it prints the number of new marks needed (either 1 or 2) and the new marks themselves.

The program handles all possible cases:

1. If the ruler can already measure both distances, it prints 0.
2. If the ruler can measure one distance but not the other, it tries to find a single new mark to measure the other distance.
3. If the ruler cannot measure either distance, it adds two new marks to measure both distances.

The program uses a set to store the existing marks, which allows for efficient lookups when checking if a new mark can be used to measure a distance.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
