Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The program starts by taking the initial weights of Limak and Bob as input, then enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight in each iteration, incrementing the year counter until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. 

The loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's, and the weights are updated correctly inside the loop. The program handles all potential cases, including the edge case where Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, as demonstrated by the example input `1 1`, which correctly outputs `1`.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, and it correctly calculates the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob for all possible input values within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
