Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It takes the initial weights of Limak and Bob as input, and then enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight, incrementing the year counter each time. The loop continues until Limak's weight is greater than Bob's weight, at which point it prints the number of years that have passed.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, or where Limak's weight is much smaller than Bob's weight. The while loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight, which is the desired condition.

The program also passes all the provided example test cases, which further confirms its correctness. In each of these cases, the program outputs the correct number of years after which Limak becomes larger than Bob. 

Overall, the program is a simple and effective solution to the problem, and it correctly handles all possible cases.
