Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than his brother Bob. The while loop continues to triple Limak's weight and double Bob's weight until Limak's weight is greater than Bob's. The years variable is incremented at each iteration of the loop, and the final value of years is printed.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, or where Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. The program also correctly handles cases where Limak and Bob have different initial weights.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For example, when the input is 4 7, the program correctly outputs 2, and when the input is 1 1, the program correctly outputs 1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
