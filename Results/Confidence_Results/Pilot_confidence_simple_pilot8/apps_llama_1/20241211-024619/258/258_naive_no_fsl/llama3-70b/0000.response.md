Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. The issue lies in the implementation of the `func_2` and `func_3` functions.

In the `func_2` function, the code is calculating the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready, but it's using the same coordinates `(x, y)` for all pieces of meat, which is incorrect. Instead, it should be using the coordinates of each individual piece of meat.

In the `func_3` function, the code is iterating over all possible integer coordinates for the heat source, but it's using the same coordinates `(x, y)` for the heat source and for the piece of meat, which is incorrect. Instead, it should be using the coordinates `(X, Y)` for the heat source and `(x, y)` for each individual piece of meat.

Additionally, the `func_3` function is sorting the times for all pieces of meat, but it's not considering the actual coordinates of each piece of meat. Instead, it should be calculating the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready based on its individual coordinates and the coordinates of the heat source.

A correct implementation of the `func_2` and `func_3` functions would involve iterating over all possible coordinates for the heat source and calculating the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready based on its individual coordinates and the coordinates of the heat source.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
2 2
0 0 1
1 1 1
```
In this case, the program will output `1.0`, but the correct output should be `1.0` when the heat source is placed at `(0.5, 0.5)`. However, the program does not consider this case because it only iterates over integer coordinates for the heat source.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to iterate over all possible real coordinates for the heat source, not just integer coordinates. Additionally, the `func_2` function should be modified to calculate the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready based on its individual coordinates and the coordinates of the heat source. 

Here is the correct code:

```python
import math

def func_1(x, y, X, Y, c):
    return c * math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)

def func_3(meats, K):
    ans = float('inf')
    for X in [i/10.0 for i in range(-10000, 10001)]:
        for Y in [i/10.0 for i in range(-10000, 10001)]:
            times = [func_1(x, y, X, Y, c) for (x, y, c) in meats]
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
    return ans

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3(meats, K))
```

This code iterates over all possible real coordinates for the heat source with a step of `0.1` and calculates the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready based on its individual coordinates and the coordinates of the heat source. The output of this code should be the correct answer for the given problem.
