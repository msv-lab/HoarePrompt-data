Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not check if the white pixels are located on the frame of the square. It simply draws a frame around the bounding box of the white pixels.

A case where the program does not work correctly is:

Input:
```
3 3
.w.
...
.w.
```
The program will output:
```
+w+
...
+w+
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
-1
```
Because there is no square frame that can contain all the white pixels.

The program should check if the white pixels are located on the frame of the square, and if not, it should return -1. The current implementation does not perform this check, making it incorrect. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check if the white pixels are located on the frame of the square, and if not, it should return -1. This can be done by checking if all the white pixels are located on the border of the square, and if any white pixel is not on the border, the program should return -1. 

Here is a possible correction to the program:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w' and (i!= top and i!= bottom and j!= left and j!= right):
                return -1
    return result
```
