Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It only checks if there is a path from the grasshopper to the target by jumping in one direction (to the right) with a fixed step size of k. However, the problem description states that the grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current cell, either to the left or to the right.

For example, if the input is:
```
7 3
T..#G..
```
The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because the grasshopper can jump from the cell at index 5 to the cell at index 2, and then to the cell at index 0, which contains the target.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), should be used to explore all possible paths from the grasshopper to the target. 

Here is a simple example of how the correct code could look like:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')

    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited = set([G_pos])

    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for jump in [k, -k]:
            new_pos = pos + jump
            if 0 <= new_pos < n and line[new_pos]!= '#' and new_pos not in visited:
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)

    print('NO')
```
