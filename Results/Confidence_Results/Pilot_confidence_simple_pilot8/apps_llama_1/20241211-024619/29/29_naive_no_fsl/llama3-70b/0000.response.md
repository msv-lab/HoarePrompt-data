Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle cases where the file names are already integers and are within the range of the total number of files. In such cases, the program will try to move a file to a name that is already occupied, which will cause the file to be overwritten.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
1 0
2 1
```
The program will output:
```
2
move 1 1
move 2 2
```
However, the first move operation will overwrite the file "1" with the contents of the file "1", which is not the intended behavior. The correct output should be:
```
3
move 1 3
move 2 1
move 3 2
```
This is because the file "1" needs to be moved to a temporary location ("3") before the file "2" can be moved to "1", and then the file in the temporary location can be moved to "2".

The program does not handle such cases correctly, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
