Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. However, if the list is empty, the function will return `True` since there are no odd indices to check. This is misleading because it implies that the condition is satisfied when, in reality, there are no elements to evaluate.

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, the function will return `True`, but logically, we cannot say that every odd index contains odd numbers because there are no indices at all. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
