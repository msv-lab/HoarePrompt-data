Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input and returns the count of occurrences of that element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method.

The assertions provided in the program test various cases:

1. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4)` correctly returns `0` because the element `4` does not exist in the tuple.
2. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10)` correctly returns `3` because the element `10` appears three times in the tuple.
3. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8)` correctly returns `4` because the element `8` appears four times in the tuple.

The function handles all edge cases properly, including cases where the element is not present in the tuple. Since there are no issues found with the implementation based on the problem description and the provided test cases, the program is correct.
