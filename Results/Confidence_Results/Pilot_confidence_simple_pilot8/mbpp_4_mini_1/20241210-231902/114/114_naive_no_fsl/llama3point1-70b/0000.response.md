Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. 

This implementation will work correctly for various cases, including:
- When `tup` is empty, it will return 0 regardless of the value of `elem`.
- When `elem` is not present in `tup`, it will also correctly return 0.
- When `elem` appears multiple times in `tup`, it will return the correct count.

Since the function handles all potential cases as described, I conclude that it is correct.
