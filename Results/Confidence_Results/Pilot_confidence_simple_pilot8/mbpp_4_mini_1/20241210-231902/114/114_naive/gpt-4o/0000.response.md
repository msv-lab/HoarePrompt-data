Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The method `tup.count(element)` is a built-in Python method that accurately returns the number of times `element` appears in `tup`. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:

1. For the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `4`, the function correctly returns `0` since `4` does not appear in the tuple.
2. For the same tuple and the element `10`, it returns `3`, which is the correct count of `10` in the tuple.
3. Finally, for the element `8`, it returns `4`, which is again correct.

Since the function handles all tested cases accurately and there are no identified edge cases or missing logic, it is deemed correct.
