Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `list_of_lists` is empty. In that scenario, calling `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`. 

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, the program will result in an error instead of returning a valid output. The problem description requires the function to find the list of maximum length, but it does not specify how to handle an empty input. Therefore, the program is not robust and does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
