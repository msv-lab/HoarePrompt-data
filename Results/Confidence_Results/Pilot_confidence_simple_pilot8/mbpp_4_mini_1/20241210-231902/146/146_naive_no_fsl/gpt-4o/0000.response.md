To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements stated in the problem description: finding the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

The function `func_1` operates as follows:

1. It initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`.
3. For each list, it checks if its length is greater than `max_len`. If it is, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current list.
4. After checking all lists, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

Let's consider a few test cases:

1. The first test case `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]` correctly returns `(3, [13, 15, 17])`.
2. The second test case `[[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]` correctly returns `(4, [10, 12, 14, 15])`.
3. The third test case `[[5], [15, 20, 25]]` correctly returns `(3, [15, 20, 25])`.

Now, let's consider edge cases:

- What if the input is an empty list of lists, such as `[]`? The function will return `(0, [])`, which is a valid output but does not specify that there is no list of maximum length, as there are no lists at all.
- What if there are multiple lists of the same maximum length? For example, `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` would return `(2, [5, 6])`, but it does not account for the fact that `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` are also of length 2, leading to ambiguity on which list should be returned.

Given the above considerations, the function does not handle the case of multiple lists of the same maximum length, and it does not appropriately handle an empty input list.

Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
