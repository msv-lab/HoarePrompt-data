Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is intended to return the angle (or phase) of a complex number represented by its real and imaginary parts. However, the assertions provided in the program are incorrectly placed before the function definition. This means that `func_1` is being called before it is defined, which will raise a `NameError`. 

Additionally, the assertions themselves do not cover all edge cases. For example, if the input is `(0, 0)`, the function should handle this case, as the phase of the complex number 0 is undefined, and it should ideally return an error or a specific value indicating this.

Since the program does not work correctly due to the misplaced assertions and does not handle all potential cases, the correctness is deemed false.
