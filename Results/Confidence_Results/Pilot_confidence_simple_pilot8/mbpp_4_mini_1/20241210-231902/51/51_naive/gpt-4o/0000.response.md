Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, the function will attempt to divide by `len(numbers)`, which is 0, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for this edge case.
