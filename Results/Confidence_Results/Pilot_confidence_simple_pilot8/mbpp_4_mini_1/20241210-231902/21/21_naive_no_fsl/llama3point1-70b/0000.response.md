Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The `min()` function will return the smallest element from the list `nums`, and it handles various scenarios including:

1. A list with positive numbers.
2. A list with negative numbers.
3. A list with a mix of positive and negative numbers.
4. A list with duplicate values.
5. An empty list (which would raise a `ValueError`, but this is a known behavior of `min()`).

Since the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle an empty list, and the function correctly identifies the smallest number in all other cases, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the expectations set by the problem description.
