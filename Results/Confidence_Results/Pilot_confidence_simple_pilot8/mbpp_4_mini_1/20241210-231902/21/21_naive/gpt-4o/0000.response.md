Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. It handles various cases, including lists with multiple elements and lists with only one element. The assertions provided also cover different scenarios, confirming that the function behaves as expected for those inputs. Since there are no edge cases or inputs where the function would fail to return the correct smallest number, the implementation is deemed correct.
