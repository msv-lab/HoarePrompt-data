To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` in relation to the problem description, which is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding Newman–Shanks–Williams Primes**:
   - The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers defined by the recurrence relation:
     - \( S(n) = 2 \cdot S(n-1) + S(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)
   - The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are:
     - \( S(0) = 1 \)
     - \( S(1) = 1 \)
     - \( S(2) = 3 \)
     - \( S(3) = 7 \)
     - \( S(4) = 17 \)
     - \( S(5) = 41 \)
   - It is important to note that the sequence starts with 1 for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \), but the actual prime numbers start from \( n = 2 \).

2. **Reviewing the Code**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the recurrence relation for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - The assertions provided in the code check for \( n = 3, 4, \) and \( 5 \), which are correct based on the known sequence.
   - However, the function returns `1` for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \). While this is consistent with the definition of the sequence, it is not a prime number.

### Potential Case of Incorrectness

- The problem description specifically asks for the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.
- For \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \), the function returns `1`, which is not a prime number. Therefore, the function does not correctly return a prime number for every valid input \( n \).

### Conclusion

Since the function does not adhere to the requirement of returning a prime number for all potential cases (specifically when \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \)), we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
