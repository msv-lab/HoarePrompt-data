To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its intended functionality.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a list and an integer `n` and split the list for every nth element, returning a list of resulting lists.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The line `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]` initializes a list of `n` empty lists. This is correct as we need to store `n` groups.

2. **Looping Through Elements**: The loop `for (i, element) in enumerate(lst)` iterates through each element in the input list `lst`.

3. **Appending Elements**: The line `result[i % n].append(element)` appends each element to one of the `n` lists based on its index `i`. This means:
   - The first element (index 0) goes to `result[0]`
   - The second element (index 1) goes to `result[1]`
   - The nth element (index n-1) goes to `result[n-1]`
   - The (n+1)th element (index n) goes back to `result[0]`, and so on.

### Testing the Provided Assertions:
- The function is tested with three assertions, and they all appear to return the expected results:
  - For the first assertion, splitting `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` with `n=3`, it returns `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`, which is correct.
  - For the second assertion, splitting a list of integers with `n=3` returns the expected result.
  - For the third assertion, splitting a list of strings with `n=2` also returns the expected result.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, `func_1([], n)` should ideally return `[[], [], ...]` (a list of `n` empty lists). The current implementation will return a list of `n` empty lists as expected.

2. **n Greater than List Length**: If `n` is greater than the length of the list, the function will still work correctly, as the elements will be distributed among the available slots, but some lists may remain empty.

3. **n Equal to 0**: If `n` is 0, this will raise an error because `range(n)` will not work. This is a potential edge case that the function does not handle.

4. **Negative n**: If `n` is negative, this will also cause issues as the range will not be valid.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero, which leads to incorrect behavior in those scenarios. Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
