Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list into sublists for every nth element. 

Hereâ€™s how the function works:

1. It initializes a list of empty lists (`result`) with a length of `n`.
2. It iterates over the input list (`lst`) and for each element, it appends the element to the appropriate sublist based on its index modulo `n`.
3. Finally, it returns the list of sublists.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works correctly for various cases, including:
- A list of characters with `n = 3`
- A list of integers with `n = 3`
- A list of strings with `n = 2`

All these cases return the expected output, confirming that the function behaves as intended. 

Furthermore, there are no edge cases that the function fails to handle, as it correctly distributes elements into sublists for any list and integer `n` provided, including when `n` is greater than the length of the list or when the list is empty. 

Therefore, since the function meets the requirements for all tested cases and potential edge cases, it is correct.
