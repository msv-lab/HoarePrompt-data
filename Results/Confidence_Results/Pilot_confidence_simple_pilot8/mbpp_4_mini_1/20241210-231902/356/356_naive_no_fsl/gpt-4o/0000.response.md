Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes all whitespace characters from the input string `s` by using the `replace` method. The provided assertions test various scenarios, including multiple consecutive spaces and leading spaces, and all assertions pass as expected. 

The function handles the following cases:
- Strings with single spaces between words.
- Strings with multiple consecutive spaces.
- Strings with leading and trailing spaces.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and there are no edge cases that have been overlooked, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
