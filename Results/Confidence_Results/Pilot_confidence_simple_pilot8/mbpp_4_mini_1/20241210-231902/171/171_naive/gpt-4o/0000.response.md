Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines the parity of a given number `n`. It returns `True` if the number is odd (when `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` if the number is even (when `n % 2 == 0`). 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works as expected for the test cases:
- For `func_1(12)`, it returns `False` (even number).
- For `func_1(7)`, it returns `True` (odd number).
- For `func_1(10)`, it returns `False` (even number).

Since the function correctly identifies the parity for these examples and the logic used in the function is sound, it should work correctly for all integers, including negative numbers and zero. Thus, there are no potential cases where the function fails to meet the problem description.
