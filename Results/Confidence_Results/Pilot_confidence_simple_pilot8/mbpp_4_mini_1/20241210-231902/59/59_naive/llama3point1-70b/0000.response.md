Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The use of the `sorted()` function on the concatenated lists (`list1 + list2 + list3`) ensures that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order. This implementation handles various cases, including:

1. All three lists being empty, which will correctly return an empty list.
2. Lists containing duplicate elements, which will be preserved in the sorted output.
3. Lists being of different lengths, which will be handled correctly by concatenation and sorting.

Since I cannot think of any input where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
