Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. 

The program handles various potential cases, including:
- All three lists being empty, which results in an empty sorted list.
- Lists containing elements of different types, assuming they are all comparable (e.g., all integers or all strings).
- Lists being already sorted, which will still produce a correctly sorted output.

Since there are no edge cases that can break the logic of the program under the assumption that the input lists contain comparable elements, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
