Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It concatenates the three input lists and then sorts the resulting combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is efficient and handles edge cases, such as duplicate values and varying lengths of input lists.

The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases, and they all return the expected sorted outputs. Since I could not identify any input case where the function fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
