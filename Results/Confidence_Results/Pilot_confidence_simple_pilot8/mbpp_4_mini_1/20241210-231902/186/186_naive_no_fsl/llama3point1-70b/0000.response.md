To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the code implementation.

The problem description states that we need to extract elementwise operations from two tuples. The provided program uses a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between corresponding elements of the two tuples. 

Let's consider the following points:

1. **Tuple Lengths**: The code uses `zip(tup1, tup2)`, which means that if the tuples are of different lengths, only the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple will be processed. This could lead to loss of data from the longer tuple, which may not be the intended behavior as per a typical interpretation of "extracting elementwise".

2. **Data Types**: The code assumes that the elements in both tuples are integers (or types that support the bitwise AND operation). If the tuples contain non-integer types (like strings or lists), the operation would raise a `TypeError`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If either tuple is empty, the result will be an empty tuple, which may or may not be the desired behavior.
   - If one tuple is empty and the other is not, the result will also be an empty tuple, which could be seen as incorrect behavior depending on the problem requirements.

Given these considerations, the program does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths or contain non-integer types. Thus, the program is not universally correct for all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False** 

An example where the program does not work correctly is when we input two tuples of different lengths, such as `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`. The result will be `(0, 0)` instead of providing a meaningful output for all elements.
