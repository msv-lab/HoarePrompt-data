Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which removes duplicate characters. If the length of the set is 1, it means all characters in the string are the same. This function will work for various cases, including:

1. An empty string `""` returns `True` (since there are no characters, it can be considered as having the same character).
2. A single character string like `"a"` returns `True`.
3. A string with identical characters like `"aaaa"` returns `True`.
4. A string with different characters like `"abc"` returns `False`.

Since it handles all possible cases correctly, the implementation is valid.
