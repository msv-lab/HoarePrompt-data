Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input string is empty correctly. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all characters in the string are the same. However, the function returns `True` for an empty string (`s`), which is not consistent with the expectation that an empty string does not have characters to compare. 

For example:
- `func_1('')` should return `False` because there are no characters to compare, and thus it cannot be said that all characters are the same.

Since the program fails to handle this edge case appropriately, it is incorrect.
