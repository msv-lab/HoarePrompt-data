Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the snake case string starts with an underscore or contains consecutive underscores. For example:

- Input: `'__python_program'` should return `'PythonProgram'`, but the current implementation would return `'PythonProgram'` as well, which is correct. However, if we consider an input like `'_python_program'`, the expected output should be `'PythonProgram'`, but the function will return `'PythonProgram'`, which is correct. 

However, the more critical case is when there are multiple underscores or leading/trailing underscores, such as:

- Input: `'python__program'` should return `'PythonProgram'`, but the function will produce `'PythonProgram'` as well, which is correct.

Additionally, the function does not handle empty strings or strings that consist solely of underscores, which should ideally return an empty string or raise an error. 

Therefore, the function does not account for all potential edge cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
