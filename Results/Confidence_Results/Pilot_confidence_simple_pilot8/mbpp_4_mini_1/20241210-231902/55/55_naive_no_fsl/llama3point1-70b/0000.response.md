To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it properly converts a snake case string to a camel case string.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` does the following:
1. It takes a string `snake_case_str` as input.
2. It splits the string into words using the underscore (`_`) as a delimiter.
3. It capitalizes each word (the first letter of each word is made uppercase) and joins them together into a single string.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires converting a snake case string (e.g., `this_is_a_test`) into a camel case string (e.g., `ThisIsATest`). 

### Test Cases:
1. **Basic test case**: 
   - Input: `"this_is_a_test"`
   - Expected Output: `"ThisIsATest"`
   - Actual Output: `"ThisIsATest"` (Correct)

2. **Multiple underscores**: 
   - Input: `"this__is_a__test"`
   - Expected Output: `"ThisIsATest"` (assuming double underscores are treated as a single word)
   - Actual Output: `"ThisIsATest"` (Incorrect, should handle double underscores)

3. **Leading and trailing underscores**:
   - Input: `"_this_is_a_test_"` 
   - Expected Output: `"ThisIsATest"` (leading and trailing underscores should be ignored)
   - Actual Output: `"ThisIsATest"` (Incorrect, leading and trailing underscores should not affect the output)

4. **Empty string**:
   - Input: `""`
   - Expected Output: `""` (an empty string should remain empty)
   - Actual Output: `""` (Correct)

5. **Single word**:
   - Input: `"test"`
   - Expected Output: `"Test"`
   - Actual Output: `"Test"` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases with multiple underscores correctly and does not address leading and trailing underscores. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
