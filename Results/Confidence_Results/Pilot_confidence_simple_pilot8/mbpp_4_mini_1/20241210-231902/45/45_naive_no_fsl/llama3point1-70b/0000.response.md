To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the function `func_1(n)` and how it checks if a number is undulating.

### Understanding "Undulating":
An undulating number is one where the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. For example:
- 121 is undulating (increases then decreases).
- 1234 is not undulating (only increases).
- 4321 is not undulating (only decreases).
- 1212 is undulating (alternates).

### Analyzing the Code:
The provided code converts the number `n` into a string and initializes a variable `undulating` to `True`. It then iterates through the digits of the string representation of the number, checking whether the current digit is part of an increasing or decreasing sequence.

The critical part of the logic is:
```python
if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
```
This checks if the current digit is either part of an increasing sequence or part of a decreasing sequence. If neither condition is met, it sets `undulating` to `False`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle single-digit numbers or two-digit numbers properly. 
   - For example, `n = 5` should be considered undulating since it has no adjacent digits to compare. 
   - For `n = 12`, it should also be considered undulating, but the logic only checks sequences of three digits.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The condition checks for three consecutive digits, which means it will miss cases where the undulation might not involve three digits. 
   - For instance, the number `121` is undulating, but the check will not capture all undulating patterns.

3. **Return Value**: The function will always return `True` for numbers with fewer than three digits, which is incorrect since we cannot determine undulation with insufficient digits.

### Example Case:
- For `n = 5`, the function will return `True`, but logically it should be considered undulating.
- For `n = 12`, the function will return `True`, but it should also be considered undulating.

Given these observations, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases for undulating numbers.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to handle single-digit and two-digit numbers correctly, and it does not fully capture the undulating nature of numbers with fewer than three digits. Thus, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
