Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where either the length or the width of the rectangle is negative or zero. According to the problem description, the area of a rectangle should only be calculated for positive dimensions. For example, if `func_1(-10, 20)` is called, it would return -200, which is incorrect for the area of a rectangle. Similarly, if `func_1(0, 20)` is called, it would return 0, which is also a misleading output since the area cannot be defined for a rectangle with zero dimensions. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
