Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This conversion is mathematically accurate for all potential inputs, including positive degrees, negative degrees, and zero. The use of `math.pi` ensures that the value of pi is precise, and since the formula is universally applicable for converting degrees to radians, the function will work correctly for any valid degree input.
