Correctness: **False**.

The program defines the function `func_1` to convert degrees to radians, but it contains assertions before the function definition. This will lead to a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined at the time the assertions are executed. 

For example, if you run the assertions as they are, you will get an error saying `NameError: name 'func_1' is not defined`. Thus, the program does not work correctly as per the problem description.
