To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function sorts the array and computes the differences between consecutive elements to find the minimum difference. This approach is correct for finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a sorted array.
  
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function checks if `n < 2` and returns `0` in that case. This is a reasonable safeguard since a minimum difference cannot be computed with fewer than two elements.
   - The function handles arrays where all elements are unique, as well as arrays with duplicates.

3. **Testing**: The assertions provided test the function with various inputs and expected outputs, which appear to be correct.

### Potential Issues:
- The function assumes that `n` (the length of the array) is always provided correctly. If `n` does not match the actual length of the array, it could lead to incorrect behavior.
- If the input array contains only one element or is empty, the function returns `0`, which may not align with the expectation that no minimum difference can be determined.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum difference between any two elements for valid inputs. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where the array might be empty or contain only one element, which could lead to unexpected results if the assertions were based on incorrect assumptions about input validity.

Thus, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically the case of input validation regarding the size of the array, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.
