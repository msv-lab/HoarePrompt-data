Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a given month number (1 through 12) corresponds to a month that contains 31 days. The list `months_31_days` includes the month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

The function checks if the input month number `n` is in this list. 

Here are the cases to consider:
- For `n = 1`, the function returns `True` (January has 31 days).
- For `n = 3`, the function returns `True` (March has 31 days).
- For `n = 5`, the function returns `True` (May has 31 days).
- For `n = 7`, the function returns `True` (July has 31 days).
- For `n = 8`, the function returns `True` (August has 31 days).
- For `n = 10`, the function returns `True` (October has 31 days).
- For `n = 12`, the function returns `True` (December has 31 days).
- For `n = 4`, `n = 6`, `n = 9`, and `n = 11`, the function correctly returns `False` (these months do not have 31 days).
- For `n = 2`, the function also correctly returns `False` (February typically has 28 or 29 days).

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as invalid month numbers (e.g., 0 or 13) which would also return `False` since they are not included in the list. 

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs, it is correct.
