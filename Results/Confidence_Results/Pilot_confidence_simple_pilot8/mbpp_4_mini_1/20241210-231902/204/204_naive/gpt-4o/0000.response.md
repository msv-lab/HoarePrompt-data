Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). The function then checks if the input month is in this set.

The provided assertions cover various cases:
- Month 5 (May) returns `True` (correct).
- Month 2 (February) returns `False` (correct).
- Month 6 (June) returns `False` (correct).
- Month 1 (January) returns `True` (correct).
- Month 12 (December) returns `True` (correct).
- Month 11 (November) returns `False` (correct).

Since all the cases are handled correctly and there are no edge cases missed, the program is correct.
