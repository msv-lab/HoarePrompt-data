To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to merge two lists, sort them, and then determine the median based on the size provided. 

1. **Merging and Sorting**: 
   - The program merges the two lists using `list1 + list2` and sorts the merged list.
  
2. **Finding the Median**:
   - The program calculates the middle index as `size - 1`, which is incorrect for finding the median in a zero-indexed list. The correct middle index for even-sized lists should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`.
   - The program checks if the size is even or odd. However, since the median calculation is based on an incorrect middle index, it will yield incorrect results.

### Edge Cases:
- If the lists are both empty, the program will still attempt to access indices, leading to an IndexError.
- If both lists contain a single element (e.g., `[1]` and `[2]`), the program would incorrectly calculate the median as it does not handle the indices properly.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```python
list1 = [1]
list2 = [2]
size = 1
```
The merged list will be `[1, 2]`. The program will incorrectly calculate the median as the middle index will be `0`, resulting in `median = merged_list[0]` which is `1`. The correct median should be `(1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to correctly calculate the median due to an incorrect index calculation and does not handle edge cases properly, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
