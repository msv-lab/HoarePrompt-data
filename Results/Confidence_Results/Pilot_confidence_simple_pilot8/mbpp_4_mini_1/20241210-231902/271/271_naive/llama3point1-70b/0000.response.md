Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. It uses the `zip` function to group the elements by their positions and then calculates the average for each group. 

For example, given the input `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, the program will calculate:
- For the first position: (1 + 3 + 5) / 3 = 3.0
- For the second position: (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 4.0

Thus, the output will be `[3.0, 4.0]`, which is correct. 

The code handles tuples of different lengths gracefully since `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple, preventing any index errors. Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description.
