Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums`, checking if the number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases, returning lists that only contain the odd numbers from the input. Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, it is correct.
