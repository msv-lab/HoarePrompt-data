To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function and the assertions.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to write a function that counts the occurrences of all elements from a list in a tuple.

### Provided Code:
```python
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The function `func_1` takes two arguments: a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`.
2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each `element` in `elements` and counts how many times that `element` appears in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`.
3. It sums these counts to get the total occurrences of all specified elements in the tuple.

### Testing the Assertions:
- The first assertion checks if there are 3 occurrences of 'a' and 'b' in the tuple `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')`, which is correct.
- The second assertion checks for 6 occurrences of 1, 4, and 7 in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4)`, which is also correct.
- The third assertion checks for 2 occurrences of 1 and 2 in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`, which is correct as well.

### Edge Cases:
Now let's consider edge cases:
1. If `elements` is an empty list, the function should return 0 since there are no elements to count.
2. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function should also return 0 regardless of the contents of `elements`.
3. If `elements` contains an item that is not present in `tup`, it should not affect the count negatively.

### Example Cases:
- `func_1((), [])` should return `0`.
- `func_1((), ['a'])` should return `0`.
- `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), ['d'])` should return `0`.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle the edge cases where either `tup` or `elements` is empty. Specifically:
- If `elements` is empty, it should return `0`, but the current implementation would return `0` due to the summation of an empty generator, which is technically correct.
- However, if `tup` is empty, the function will still return `0`, which is also correct.

Despite these considerations, the function works as intended for the provided assertions and edge cases. 

Correctness: **True**
