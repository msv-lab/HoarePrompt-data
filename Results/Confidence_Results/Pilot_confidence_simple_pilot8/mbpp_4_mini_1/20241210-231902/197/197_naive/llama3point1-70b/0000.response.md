Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and sums the counts of each element found in the tuple. This approach effectively handles all potential cases, including when the list is empty (returning 0) or when there are no matching elements in the tuple (also returning 0). Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem description and works as expected for all scenarios.
