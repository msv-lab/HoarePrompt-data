To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
```

### Problem Description:
The function should check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The expression `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. The result will have bits set to `1` wherever the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. The function then converts this result to a binary string using `bin()`.
3. It counts the number of `1`s in the binary representation with `.count('1')`.
4. Finally, it checks if this count is equal to `1`, which would indicate that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

### Edge Cases:
- **Identical Numbers**: If `num1` and `num2` are the same (e.g., `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 5`), the function should return `False`, which it does.
- **Differing at One Bit**: If `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit (e.g., `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 4`), the function should return `True`, which it does.
- **Differing at Multiple Bits**: If `num1` and `num2` differ at more than one bit (e.g., `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 6`), the function should return `False`, which it does.

### Testing with Examples:
1. `func_1(5, 5)` returns `False` (correct).
2. `func_1(5, 4)` returns `True` (correct).
3. `func_1(5, 6)` returns `False` (correct).
4. `func_1(0, 1)` returns `True` (correct, differing at one bit).
5. `func_1(0, 2)` returns `False` (correct, differing at two bits).

After considering the edge cases and testing various scenarios, it appears that the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly identifies whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position in all tested cases and logical scenarios, we conclude that the implementation meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
