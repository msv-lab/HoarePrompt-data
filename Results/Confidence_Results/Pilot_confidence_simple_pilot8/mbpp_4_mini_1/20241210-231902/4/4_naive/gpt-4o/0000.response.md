To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1` and the requirements outlined.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check whether two numbers differ at only one bit position.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0
```

### Analysis:
1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation (`^`) between two numbers will yield a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. If two numbers differ at one bit position, the result of the XOR will have exactly one bit set to 1.

2. **Checking for One Bit Difference**:
   - `xor_result != 0`: This checks that the two numbers are not identical.
   - `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`: This checks that there is only one bit set in the `xor_result`. The expression `xor_result - 1` will clear the least significant set bit of `xor_result`, and if there was only one bit set, the result of the AND operation will be zero.

### Testing the Cases:
- **Case 1**: `func_1(13, 9)`:
  - `13` in binary is `1101`
  - `9` in binary is `1001`
  - `xor_result` = `1101 ^ 1001` = `0100` (which has one bit set)
  - Returns `True` (correct).

- **Case 2**: `func_1(15, 8)`:
  - `15` in binary is `1111`
  - `8` in binary is `1000`
  - `xor_result` = `1111 ^ 1000` = `0111` (which has more than one bit set)
  - Returns `False` (correct).

- **Case 3**: `func_1(2, 4)`:
  - `2` in binary is `0010`
  - `4` in binary is `0100`
  - `xor_result` = `0010 ^ 0100` = `0110` (which has more than one bit set)
  - Returns `False` (correct).

- **Case 4**: `func_1(2, 3)`:
  - `2` in binary is `0010`
  - `3` in binary is `0011`
  - `xor_result` = `0010 ^ 0011` = `0001` (which has one bit set)
  - Returns `True` (correct).

- **Case 5**: `func_1(5, 1)`:
  - `5` in binary is `0101`
  - `1` in binary is `0001`
  - `xor_result` = `0101 ^ 0001` = `0100` (which has one bit set)
  - Returns `True` (correct).

- **Case 6**: `func_1(1, 5)`:
  - `1` in binary is `0001`
  - `5` in binary is `0101`
  - `xor_result` = `0001 ^ 0101` = `0100` (which has one bit set)
  - Returns `True` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if two numbers differ at only one bit position. It has been tested against various cases, and all assertions hold true. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Correctness: **True**.
