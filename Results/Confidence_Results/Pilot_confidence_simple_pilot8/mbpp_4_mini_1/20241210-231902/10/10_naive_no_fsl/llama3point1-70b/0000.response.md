Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is given by:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Area of the base} \times \text{Length} \]

The area of the triangular base is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

In the function `func_1(b, h, l)`, the calculation performed is:

```python
return b * h / 2 * l
```

This expression correctly computes the volume as it first calculates the area of the triangle (using `b * h / 2`) and then multiplies it by the length `l` of the prism.

Since the function correctly implements the mathematical principles needed to find the volume of a triangular prism for any valid inputs of base `b`, height `h`, and length `l`, there are no edge cases where the function would fail to produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.
