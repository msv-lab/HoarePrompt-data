To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the assertions given.

The problem description states that the function should "add the given tuple to the given list." 

The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
```
This function takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`), converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenates it to the original list using the `+` operator.

The assertions provided check the function with different inputs:
1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` should return `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` should return `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` should return `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`

All of these assertions are correct based on the logic of the function.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:
1. What if the input list is empty? For example, `func_1([], (1, 2))` should return `[1, 2]`.
2. What if the input tuple is empty? For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], ())` should return `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. What if both the list and tuple are empty? For example, `func_1([], ())` should return `[]`.

All these cases should work correctly:
- `func_1([], (1, 2))` returns `[1, 2]` as expected.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3], ())` returns `[1, 2, 3]` as expected.
- `func_1([], ())` returns `[]` as expected.

Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description, we conclude that the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
