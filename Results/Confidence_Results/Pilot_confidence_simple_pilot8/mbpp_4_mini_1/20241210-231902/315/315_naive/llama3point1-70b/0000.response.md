Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list and a tuple as input and returns a new list that is the result of concatenating the original list with the elements of the tuple. 

Here are the reasons why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two parameters: a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`).
2. **Conversion and Concatenation**: It converts the tuple to a list using `list(input_tuple)` and concatenates it with the original list using the `+` operator.
3. **Output**: The function returns the concatenated result, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

No edge cases or incorrect behaviors can be identified that would cause the function to fail in achieving the described functionality for any valid inputs. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem statement in all cases.
