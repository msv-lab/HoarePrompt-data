Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly adds the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and using the `+` operator to concatenate them. The assertions provided test the function with different inputs, and all of them return the expected results. The function handles all potential cases, including tuples of varying lengths and empty tuples, correctly appending their elements to the list. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description.
