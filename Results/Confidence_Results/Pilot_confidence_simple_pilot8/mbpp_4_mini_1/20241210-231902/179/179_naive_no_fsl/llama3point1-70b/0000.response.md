Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It generates the first `n` even natural numbers using `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which produces the sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n`.
3. For each of these even numbers, it calculates their cubes using the expression `(i ** 3 for i in ...)`.
4. The `sum()` function then adds these cubes together.

To verify the correctness, consider the following examples:

- For `n = 1`: The first even natural number is 2. The cube is \(2^3 = 8\). The output is 8, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`: The first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\). The sum is \(8 + 64 = 72\), which is correct.
- For `n = 3`: The first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), and \(6^3 = 216\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\), which is correct.

Since the program correctly handles the cube sum for all tested cases of `n`, and no edge cases or missing logic have been identified, the program is deemed correct.
