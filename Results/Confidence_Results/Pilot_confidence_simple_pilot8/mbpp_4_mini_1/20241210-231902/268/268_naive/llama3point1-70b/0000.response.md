Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle cases where the column index `n` is out of bounds for the given matrix. For example:

1. If `matrix` is `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `n` is `3`, the program will throw an `IndexError` because there is no third column in the matrix.
2. If `matrix` is empty (i.e., `[]`) and `n` is `1`, the program will also throw an `IndexError` as there are no rows to access.

Since the program does not account for these potential cases, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
