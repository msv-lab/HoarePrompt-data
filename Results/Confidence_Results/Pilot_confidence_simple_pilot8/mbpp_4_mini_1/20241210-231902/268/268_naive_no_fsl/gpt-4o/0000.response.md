To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the problem description.

### Problem Description
The function should return the maximum value from the nth column of a matrix represented as a list of lists.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
```

### Assertions
```python
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11
```

### Analysis
1. **Column Indexing**: The function accesses the nth column using `row[n]`. This assumes that `n` is a valid index for all rows in the matrix. If `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in any row, it will raise an `IndexError`.
  
2. **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix is empty, `nth_column` will also be empty, and calling `max` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`.

3. **Single Row Matrix**: The function should still work with a single row matrix, but it should handle cases where `n` is out of bounds.

4. **Negative Index**: Python allows negative indexing, which should be considered. If `n` is negative, it should correctly access the column from the end of the list.

### Potential Edge Cases
- If `n` is out of bounds (greater than or equal to the number of columns).
- If the matrix is empty.
- If `n` is negative and out of bounds (less than the negative length of rows).
- If the rows have different lengths, which could lead to an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion
The function does not handle the above edge cases, which means it can fail for certain inputs. For example:

- Calling `func_1([], 0)` would raise a `ValueError` due to trying to find the maximum of an empty list.
- Calling `func_1([[1]], 1)` would raise an `IndexError` because there is no second column.

Since there are cases where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
