Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description. The issue arises when the list contains negative numbers. 

For example, consider the input `[-1.5, -2.3, -3.7]`. The rounded values would be `[-2, -2, -4]`. The total sum of these rounded numbers is `-8`, and the length of the list is `3`. According to the program, the result would be `-8 * 3 = -24`. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle negative numbers, and thus this case could be considered ambiguous or incorrect based on the lack of explicit handling in the description.

Additionally, the assertion tests provided do not cover edge cases like empty lists or lists with only negative numbers. Therefore, the program may not work correctly for all potential cases.
