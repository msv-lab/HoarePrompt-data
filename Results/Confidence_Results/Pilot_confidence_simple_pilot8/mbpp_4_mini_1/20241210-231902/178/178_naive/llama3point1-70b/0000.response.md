Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly rounds every number in the input list and calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, which is then multiplied by the length of the list. 

Here's why the program works as intended:
1. The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` effectively rounds each number in the `numbers` list.
2. The `sum(rounded_numbers)` computes the sum of these rounded numbers accurately.
3. Finally, multiplying this sum by `len(numbers)` gives the correct total as specified in the problem description.

Since I cannot identify any edge cases or inputs where the function would fail to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
