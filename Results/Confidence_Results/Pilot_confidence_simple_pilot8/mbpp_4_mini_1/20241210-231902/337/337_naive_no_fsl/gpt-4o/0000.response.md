To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description: "Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list."

The implementation of `func_1` is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

### Analysis of the Implementation:
1. **Understanding `set(lst)`**: 
   - The `set` function in Python creates a set from the list, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. 
   - This means that if an element appears more than once in the list, it will only be counted once in the sum.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - The problem specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements. This means we should only consider elements that appear exactly once in the list.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The first test case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` should return the sum of non-repeated elements: `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`. The function will return `21` because it includes `1` which is repeated.
   - The second test case `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` should return `1 + 9 + 2 + 45 = 57`, but it will return `71` since it includes `10` and `4` which are repeated.
   - The third test case `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` should return `12 + 9 + 2 = 23`, but the function will return `78` as it includes `10` and `45` which are repeated.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly implement the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements. It incorrectly sums all unique elements instead of only those that appear exactly once.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure:
For the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the expected output is `20` (sum of non-repeated elements 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), but the function returns `21`, which is incorrect.
