To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
   - It uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list.
   - For each element `i`, it checks if `lst.count(i) == 1`, which means it checks if the element appears exactly once in the list.
   - If the condition is met, the element is included in the sum.

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The use of `lst.count(i)` is inefficient because it traverses the list for each element to count occurrences, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.
   - More importantly, we need to check if the logic works correctly for all potential cases.

### Test Cases

Let's consider some test cases:

- **Case 1**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 2])`
  - Expected output: `1 + 3 = 4` (since `2` is repeated)
  - Actual output: `4` (correct)

- **Case 2**: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1])`
  - Expected output: `0` (since all elements are repeated)
  - Actual output: `0` (correct)

- **Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])`
  - Expected output: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` (all elements are non-repeated)
  - Actual output: `10` (correct)

- **Case 4**: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4])`
  - Expected output: `1 + 3 = 4` (only `1` and `3` are non-repeated)
  - Actual output: `4` (correct)

- **Case 5**: `func_1([])`
  - Expected output: `0` (empty list)
  - Actual output: `0` (correct)

### Conclusion

After reviewing the logic and testing various cases, the function behaves as expected and correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. 

Correctness: **True**
