Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the second smallest number in a list. However, it does not handle cases where the list contains only one unique number correctly. 

For example, in the test case `func_1([2, 2])`, the output is `None`, which is correct. However, if we consider the input `func_1([1, 1, 1])`, the output would also be `None`, which is acceptable. 

However, the issue arises with the input `func_1([3, 1, 1, 1])`, where the second smallest number should be `3`, but since `1` is the only unique number, the output would be `None` instead of `3`. 

Thus, the function does not correctly identify the second smallest number in all cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
