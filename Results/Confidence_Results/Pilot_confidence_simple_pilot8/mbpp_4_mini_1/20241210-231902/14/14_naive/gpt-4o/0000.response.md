Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(arr)` correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. It uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far. If a number is encountered that is already in the set, it returns `True`, indicating that there is a duplicate. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The provided assertions test the function with various cases:
1. The first assertion tests an array with all unique elements and correctly returns `False`.
2. The second assertion tests an array with a duplicate (`4`) and correctly returns `True`.
3. The third assertion tests an array with multiple duplicates and correctly returns `True`.

Since the function handles all tested cases appropriately and there are no identified edge cases or missing logic, the program is correct.
