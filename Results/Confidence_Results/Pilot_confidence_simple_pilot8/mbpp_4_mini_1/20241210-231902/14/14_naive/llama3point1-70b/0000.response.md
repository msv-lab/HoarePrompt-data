Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether the given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. It does this by comparing the length of the original array `arr` with the length of the set created from `arr`. Since sets do not allow duplicate values, if there are any duplicates in `arr`, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original array, and the function will return `True`. If there are no duplicates, both lengths will be equal, and the function will return `False`. 

This logic covers all potential cases, including:
- An empty array (no duplicates).
- An array with all unique elements.
- An array with one or more duplicate elements.

Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all inputs.
