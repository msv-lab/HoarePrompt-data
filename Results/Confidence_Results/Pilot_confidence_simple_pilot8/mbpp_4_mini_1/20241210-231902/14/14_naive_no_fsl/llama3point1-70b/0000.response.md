Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks for duplicates in the array by comparing the length of the original array to the length of a set created from that array. However, the logic used in the return statement is incorrect for the problem description.

The function should return `True` if there are duplicates in the array and `False` if there are no duplicates. The current implementation returns `True` when there are duplicates and `False` when there are not. This is the opposite of what is required.

For example, consider the input:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The expected output should be `False` because there are no duplicates. However, the function will return `True`, indicating that duplicates exist, which is incorrect.

Thus, the function does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
