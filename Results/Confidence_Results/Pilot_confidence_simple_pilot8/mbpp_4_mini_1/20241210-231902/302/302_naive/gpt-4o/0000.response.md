To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the assertions.

The problem description requires a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `low` and `high` are initialized correctly to represent the bounds of the search space.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues while `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which is appropriate for binary search.
3. **Finding the Target**: 
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, it stores the index in `result` and continues searching in the left half (`high = mid - 1`) to find the first occurrence.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, it narrows the search to the right half (`low = mid + 1`).
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, it narrows the search to the left half (`high = mid - 1`).
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the index of the first occurrence or `-1` if the target is not found.

### Test Cases:
The assertions provided are:
- `assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1` (correct, first occurrence of 5 is at index 1)
- `assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2` (correct, first occurrence of 5 is at index 2)
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4` (correct, first occurrence of 6 is at index 4)

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Target Not Present**: If the target is not present in the array, the function should return `-1`. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 3)` should return `-1`, which is handled correctly by the current implementation.
2. **Empty Array**: If the input array is empty, `func_1([], 5)` should return `-1`, which is also handled correctly since the loop condition will not be satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of the target in the sorted array for the given test cases and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.
