Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) using the formulas for r and θ. The assertions given in the program test the function with specific values, and they all return the expected results.

1. **Conversion Logic**:
   - The radius \( r \) is calculated using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is correct.
   - The angle \( \theta \) is calculated using \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \), which correctly handles the quadrant of the point (x, y).

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where x or y is zero, such as (0, 0) which would return (0, 0) for polar coordinates.
   - For points on the axes, the angle is correctly determined by the `atan2` function.

Since I cannot find any input or potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
