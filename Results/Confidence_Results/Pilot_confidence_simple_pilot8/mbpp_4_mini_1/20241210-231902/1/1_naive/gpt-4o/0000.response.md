Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies shared elements between two lists by using set intersection. It converts both input lists into sets, computes the intersection to find common elements, and then returns them as a sorted tuple. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases. 

Since the function handles the inputs as specified in the problem description and returns the expected outputs for the provided examples, there are no potential edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description.
