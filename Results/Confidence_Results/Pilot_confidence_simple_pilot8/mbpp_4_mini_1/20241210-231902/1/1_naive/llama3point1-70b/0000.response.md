Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies shared elements from the two provided lists by converting both lists to sets and using the intersection operator (`&`). This approach efficiently finds the common elements, and since the result is returned as a tuple, it meets the requirements of the problem description. 

The program handles various edge cases, such as:
- If either list is empty, the result will be an empty tuple, which is correct.
- If there are no shared elements, the result will also be an empty tuple, which is correct.
- It correctly identifies shared elements regardless of their order or duplicates in the original lists.

Thus, I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
