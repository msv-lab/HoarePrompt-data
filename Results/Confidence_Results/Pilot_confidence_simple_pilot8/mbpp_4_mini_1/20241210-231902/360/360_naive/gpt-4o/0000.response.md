Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not handle the case where the input list of lists is empty. If `func_1` is called with an empty list (e.g., `func_1([])`), it will return an empty list, which does not meet the requirement of returning the list with the highest sum, as there are no sublists to evaluate. This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, demonstrating that it is incorrect.
