Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Empty Tuple**: The function correctly returns `True` for an empty tuple, which is appropriate since there are no elements to contradict the condition.

2. **Type Checking**: The function captures the type of the first element and compares it to the type of each subsequent element. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The first test case `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
   - The second test case `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because it contains an integer and a string.
   - The third test case `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.

No edge cases are missed. The function handles tuples with mixed data types and an empty tuple correctly. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
