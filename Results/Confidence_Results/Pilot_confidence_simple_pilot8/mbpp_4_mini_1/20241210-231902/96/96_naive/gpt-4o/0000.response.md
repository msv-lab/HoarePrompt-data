Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It first checks if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True` (since there are no differing types). It then stores the type of the first element and iterates through the tuple, comparing the type of each element to the type of the first. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. If all elements have the same type, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions cover various cases:
1. A tuple of integers returns `True`.
2. A tuple with mixed types (integers and a string) returns `False`.
3. Another tuple of integers returns `True`.

All potential cases that can be reasonably tested with the given implementation are handled correctly. Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
