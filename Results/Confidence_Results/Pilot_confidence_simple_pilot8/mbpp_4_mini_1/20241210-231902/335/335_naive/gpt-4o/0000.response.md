Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times in the main string. For example, if we test the function with the input `func_1('python python python', 'python')`, the expected output should be `('python', 0, 6)`, but the program would return the first occurrence correctly. However, it does not provide a way to find all occurrences or the last occurrence if needed. Additionally, the problem description does not specify that the function should return only the first occurrence, which could lead to confusion regarding its intended functionality. Therefore, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
