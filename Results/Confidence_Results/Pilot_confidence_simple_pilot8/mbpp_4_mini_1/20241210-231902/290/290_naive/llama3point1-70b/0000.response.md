Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if any word in the string `s` contains the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word. It splits the input string into words and for each word, it checks if the length is greater than 1 (to ensure there are characters between the first and last). It then checks if 'z' is present in the substring that excludes the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`). 

This logic correctly adheres to the problem description, as it only returns `True` if 'z' is found in the middle of a word, and `False` otherwise. It handles edge cases such as words that are too short (length 1) and correctly ignores 'z' at the start and end of words. Therefore, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
