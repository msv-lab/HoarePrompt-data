Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input string has a length of 2 or less. For example:

- If the input is `'za'`, the function should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- If the input is `'az'`, the function should also return `False` for the same reason.
- If the input is `'z'`, the function should return `False` as well since 'z' is at the start and end.

However, the current implementation will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `s[1:-1]` on strings of length 2 or less. This indicates that the function does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
