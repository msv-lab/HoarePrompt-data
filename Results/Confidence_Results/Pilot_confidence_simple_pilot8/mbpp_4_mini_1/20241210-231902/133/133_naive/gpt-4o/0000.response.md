To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

### Analysis of the Program
The program defines the function `func_1` as follows:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
This function uses `zip` to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, and then it computes the difference for each pair `(a, b)` where `a` comes from `tup1` and `b` comes from `tup2`. The result is returned as a tuple.

### Testing the Function
The assertions provided test the function with specific tuples:
1. `func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))` should return `(8, -1, -13)`
2. `func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))` should return `(-13, -43, -13)`
3. `func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))` should return `(-3, 7, -3)`

### Edge Cases
1. **Different Length Tuples**: The function does not handle cases where `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths. For instance:
   - If we call `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, it will only compute differences for the first two elements, resulting in `(-2, -2)`, which does not match the expected behavior of handling different lengths.
   
2. **Empty Tuples**: If both tuples are empty, it will return an empty tuple, which is correct, but if one is empty and the other is not, it won't raise an error but will also not behave as expected.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly handle the case where the tuples have different lengths, the correctness of the program is in question.

Correctness: **False**.
