Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of two tuples with the same index. The function `func_1` uses the `zip` function to pair up the elements of the two tuples and then performs the subtraction element-wise, returning the result as a new tuple.

The assertions provided in the code test various cases, and all of them return the expected results. Additionally, the program correctly handles tuples of equal length. 

There are no edge cases or potential issues identified, such as:
- If the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, which is a behavior that can be considered acceptable in this context, as the problem does not specify handling for tuples of different lengths.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description requirements for all tested cases and potential cases identified.
