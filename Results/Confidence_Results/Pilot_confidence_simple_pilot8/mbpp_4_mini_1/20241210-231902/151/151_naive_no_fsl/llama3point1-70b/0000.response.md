Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a recursive function to flatten a nested list structure. It checks each element of the input list (`nested_list`), and if the element is itself a list, it recursively calls `func_1` to flatten that sublist. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to the `flat_list`.

The function handles various cases, including:
- A completely flat list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), which will return `[1, 2, 3]`.
- A nested list (e.g., `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]`), which will correctly return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- An empty list (e.g., `[]`), which will return `[]`.
- A list with mixed types (e.g., `[1, [2, 'a'], [3.5, [4, [5]]]]`), which will return `[1, 2, 'a', 3.5, 4, 5]`.

There are no edge cases or missing logic that can be identified where the function would fail to meet the problem description. Thus, the function is deemed correct for all potential cases.
