Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a nested list structure. The function `func_1` uses recursion to handle any level of nested lists. 

Here's the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function checks if each item in the input `nested_list` is a list. If it is, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item, effectively traversing deeper into the nested structure. If the item is not a list, it appends the item directly to `flat_list`.

2. **Multiple Levels of Nesting**: The recursion allows the function to flatten lists that are nested to any depth. For example, an input like `[1, [2, [3, 4]], 5]` would be correctly flattened to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. **Handling Non-List Items**: The function can handle any type of non-list items (integers, strings, etc.) since it simply appends them to the `flat_list`.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions are valid and cover various scenarios of nested lists. They demonstrate that the function correctly flattens lists of different structures.

Since I could not find any case where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
