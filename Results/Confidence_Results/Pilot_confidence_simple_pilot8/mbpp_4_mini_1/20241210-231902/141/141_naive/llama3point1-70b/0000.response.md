To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description, which states that the function should check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Converting the Integer to String**: The integer `n` is converted to a string `str_n` to iterate over each digit.
2. **Counting Frequencies**: For each digit in `str_n`, the program counts how many times that digit appears using `str_n.count(digit)`.
3. **Comparison**: It checks if this count is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`). If it is, the function returns `False`.
4. **Return True**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

### Potential Cases to Consider:
- **Case with Digits More than Their Count**: For example, if we input `122`, the digit `2` appears twice (`count` is 2) and `2` (the digit itself) is also 2, so it would return `True`. This is correct.
- **Case with Zero**: If we input `1000`, the digit `0` appears three times, but its integer value is `0`. Thus, `3 > 0` would return `False`, which is correct.
- **Case with Larger Digits**: For `455`, the digit `5` appears twice, and its value is `5`, so it stays valid. This is correct.

### Counter-Example:
However, consider the input `111`. Here:
- The digit `1` appears three times (count is 3), and the digit itself is `1`. Since `3 > 1`, the function would return `False`, which is correct.
- But if we consider `222`, the digit `2` appears three times, and its value is `2`. Since `3 > 2`, it returns `False`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the frequency of each digit against its value. However, it does not handle the case of multiple digits correctly. For instance, if we input `222`, it should return `False`, which it does, but the logic can be misleading if we do not consider the case of digits with varying frequencies.

After analyzing various cases, it seems that the program does indeed fulfill the requirement of the problem description without missing any edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
