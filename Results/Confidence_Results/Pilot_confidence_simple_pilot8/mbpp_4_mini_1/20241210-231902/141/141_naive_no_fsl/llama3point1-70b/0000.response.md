To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to take an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program Logic:
1. The integer `n` is converted to a string `str_n`.
2. For each digit in `str_n`, the program counts the occurrences of that digit in the string.
3. It checks if the count of that digit is greater than the integer value of the digit itself.
4. If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function returns `False`.
5. If all digits meet the condition, it returns `True`.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the function behaves as expected:

1. **Case: 112**  
   - Digits: `1` appears 2 times, `2` appears 1 time.  
   - Condition: `2 (count of 1) <= 1 (value of 1)` is false.  
   - Expected: `False`  
   - Actual: `False` (Correct)

2. **Case: 123**  
   - Digits: `1` appears 1 time, `2` appears 1 time, `3` appears 1 time.  
   - Condition: `1 <= 1`, `1 <= 2`, `1 <= 3` are all true.  
   - Expected: `True`  
   - Actual: `True` (Correct)

3. **Case: 221**  
   - Digits: `2` appears 2 times, `1` appears 1 time.  
   - Condition: `2 <= 2` (true), `1 <= 1` (true).  
   - Expected: `True`  
   - Actual: `True` (Correct)

4. **Case: 1000**  
   - Digits: `1` appears 1 time, `0` appears 3 times.  
   - Condition: `1 <= 1` (true), `3 > 0` (false).  
   - Expected: `False`  
   - Actual: `False` (Correct)

5. **Case: 222**  
   - Digits: `2` appears 3 times.  
   - Condition: `3 > 2` (false).  
   - Expected: `False`  
   - Actual: `False` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- **Case: 0**  
   - Digits: `0` appears 1 time.  
   - Condition: `1 > 0` (false).  
   - Expected: `False`  
   - Actual: `False` (Correct)

- **Case: 1111**  
   - Digits: `1` appears 4 times.  
   - Condition: `4 > 1` (false).  
   - Expected: `False`  
   - Actual: `False` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The function appears to handle various cases correctly, including edge cases with zeros and multiple occurrences of digits. Every digit's frequency is checked against its value, and the function returns the expected results.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself for all tested cases.
