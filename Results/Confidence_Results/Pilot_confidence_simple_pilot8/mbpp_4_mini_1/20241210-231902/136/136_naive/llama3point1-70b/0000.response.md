Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension that iterates over the dictionary items and checks each value against `n`. 

Here are some cases to consider:
1. If the input dictionary is empty, the output will also be an empty dictionary, which is correct.
2. If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, the output will be an empty dictionary, which is also correct.
3. If there are values equal to or greater than `n`, those entries will be included in the output, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the code handles all potential cases as described, it is correct.
