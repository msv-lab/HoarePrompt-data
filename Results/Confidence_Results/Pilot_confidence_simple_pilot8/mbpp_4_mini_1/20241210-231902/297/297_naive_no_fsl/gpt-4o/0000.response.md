To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` against the problem description. The function is supposed to take a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple.

Let's break down the code:

```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))
```

This function creates a new tuple using a generator expression that iterates over the indices of the input tuple `t`, multiplying each element `t[i]` by the next element `t[i + 1]`. It does this for all indices from `0` to `len(t) - 2`, which means it correctly computes the products of consecutive elements.

Now, let's consider the test cases provided in the assertions:

1. `func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` should return `(5, 35, 56, 80)`:
   - 1 * 5 = 5
   - 5 * 7 = 35
   - 7 * 8 = 56
   - 8 * 10 = 80

2. `func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7))` should return `(8, 20, 30, 42)`:
   - 2 * 4 = 8
   - 4 * 5 = 20
   - 5 * 6 = 30
   - 6 * 7 = 42

3. `func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15))` should return `(156, 182, 126, 135)`:
   - 12 * 13 = 156
   - 13 * 14 = 182
   - 14 * 9 = 126
   - 9 * 15 = 135

4. `func_1((12,))` should return `()`:
   - Since there is only one element in the tuple, there are no consecutive pairs to multiply, which is correctly handled by returning an empty tuple.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- If the input is an empty tuple `()`, the function should return `()`. The current implementation will also handle this correctly because `len(t) - 1` will be `-1`, and the range will produce no indices, resulting in an empty tuple.

- If the input tuple has only one element, as shown in the test case `func_1((12,))`, it also returns an empty tuple, which is correct.

- If the input tuple has two elements, say `(a, b)`, it should return `(a * b,)`, which is also correctly handled by the function.

Since we have tested various cases and the logic holds for the description provided, I conclude that the function behaves as expected for all reasonable inputs.

Correctness: **True**
