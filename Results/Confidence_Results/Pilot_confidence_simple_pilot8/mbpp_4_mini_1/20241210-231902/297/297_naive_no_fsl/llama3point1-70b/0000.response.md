Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple.

1. The function `func_1` uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with the next one.
2. It then computes the product of these pairs using a generator expression and converts the result into a tuple.

For example:
- If the input is `(1, 2, 3)`, the output will be `(1*2, 2*3)` which equals `(2, 6)`.
- If the input is `(4, 5, 6, 7)`, the output will be `(4*5, 5*6, 6*7)` which equals `(20, 30, 42)`.

The function handles edge cases correctly:
- If the input tuple has only one element, for example `(5,)`, the output will be an empty tuple `()`, which is consistent with the requirement of returning a tuple of length N (where N is the length of the input tuple minus one).
- If the input is an empty tuple `()`, the output will also be an empty tuple `()`, which again meets the requirements.

Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, the program is correct.
