Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input tuple has only one element. According to the problem description, if the input is a tuple of length 1 (e.g., `(12,)`), the function should return an empty tuple, which it does. However, the assertion `assert func_1((12,)) == ()` is placed before the function definition, which will raise an error if the function is not defined yet. 

Additionally, the function itself does not handle the case of an empty tuple. If the input is `()`, it should return `()`, but the current implementation does not account for this case explicitly.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
