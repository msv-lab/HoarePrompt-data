To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and determine if it meets the requirements set in the problem description, which is to get the first element of each sublist.

Hereâ€™s the code provided:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `lst` and retrieves the first element (`sublist[0]`). 

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Empty Sublists**: If any of the sublists are empty, accessing `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example:
   ```python
   func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])  # This would raise an IndexError.
   ```

2. **Empty Input List**: If the input list itself is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is acceptable:
   ```python
   func_1([])  # This returns [] which is correct.
   ```

3. **Non-List Elements**: If `lst` contains non-list elements, it will also raise an error:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, 2], 'not a list', [3, 4]])  # This would raise a TypeError when trying to access sublist[0].
   ```

Given the above considerations, the function does not correctly handle cases where sublists are empty or where non-list elements are present in the input list. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
