To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to get the first element of each sublist.

The function is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in the input `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each `sublist`. 

Let's consider potential edge cases to see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Empty Sublists**: If one of the sublists is empty, accessing `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example:
   ```python
   func_1([[], [1, 2]])
   ```
   This would result in an error because the first sublist is empty.

2. **Empty Input List**: If the input list itself is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is correct:
   ```python
   func_1([])
   ```

3. **Non-List Elements**: If the input contains non-list elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`. For example:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, 2], 3])
   ```

4. **Nested Sublists**: If there are nested lists, the function only retrieves the first element of the outer list and does not handle deeper levels of nesting. This is not a requirement based on the problem description, but it's worth noting.

Based on the analysis, the function does not handle the case where a sublist is empty, which would lead to an error. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**

The function does not handle cases where one or more sublists are empty, which would cause an `IndexError`. For example, `func_1([[], [1, 2]])` would raise an error.
