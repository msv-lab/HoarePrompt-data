Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is an integer such that the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself.

1. The function converts the number `n` to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string representation to determine the number of digits.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Finally, it checks if this computed sum equals the original number `n`.

The provided assertions test the function with valid Armstrong numbers (153) and non-Armstrong numbers (259 and 4458), and they return the expected results. 

Since I cannot find any example where the function fails to meet the problem description, it is correct for all potential cases.
