Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` converts the input number `n` to a string to easily access each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string representation, which corresponds to the number of digits in the number.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Finally, it checks if this computed sum is equal to the original number `n`.

The assertions provided in the program:
- `func_1(153) == True`: 153 is an Armstrong number (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153).
- `func_1(259) == False`: 259 is not an Armstrong number (2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 ≠ 259).
- `func_1(4458) == False`: 4458 is not an Armstrong number (4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 ≠ 4458).

The function handles all cases correctly for positive integers. It does not currently handle negative numbers or zero, but since the problem description does not specify the handling of these cases, we assume the function is meant for positive integers only.

Since there are no examples where the function fails to meet the problem requirements for the provided inputs, the program is deemed correct.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct for the provided examples and adheres to the problem description.
