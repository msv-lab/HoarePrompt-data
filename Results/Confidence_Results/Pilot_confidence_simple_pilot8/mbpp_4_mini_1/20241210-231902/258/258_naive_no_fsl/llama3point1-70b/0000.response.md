Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is one that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It converts the input number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the number (i.e., the number of digits).
3. It initializes a sum variable to zero.
4. It iterates through each digit, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds that to the sum.
5. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number and returns the result.

The program correctly handles all potential cases for Armstrong numbers, including single-digit numbers (which are always Armstrong numbers), and it will return `True` for valid Armstrong numbers and `False` for non-Armstrong numbers.

For example:
- For input `153`, the program calculates `1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`, which is equal to the original number, so it returns `True`.
- For input `123`, it calculates `1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36`, which is not equal to `123`, so it returns `False`.

Since I cannot think of any edge cases or inputs where the program would fail to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
