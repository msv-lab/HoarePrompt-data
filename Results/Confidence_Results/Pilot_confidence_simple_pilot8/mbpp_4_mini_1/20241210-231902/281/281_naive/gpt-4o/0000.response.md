Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers. The logic used in the list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` accurately checks each number in the input list to see if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., even). 

The provided assertions also demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it correctly returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it correctly returns `[8, 12]`.

Since the function handles the provided cases correctly and there are no identified edge cases or potential failures, the function is deemed correct for the problem description.
