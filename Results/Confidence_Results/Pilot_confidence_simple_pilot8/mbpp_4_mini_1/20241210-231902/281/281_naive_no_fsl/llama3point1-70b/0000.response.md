Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find even numbers from a list of numbers. 

Here's how the function works:
- It takes a list of numbers as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the list.
- For each number, it checks if the number is even by evaluating the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
- If the condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list.

This implementation will correctly identify all even numbers in any list of integers, including edge cases such as:
- An empty list (returns an empty list).
- A list with no even numbers (returns an empty list).
- A list with all even numbers (returns the same list).
- A list with negative numbers (correctly identifies even negative numbers).

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
