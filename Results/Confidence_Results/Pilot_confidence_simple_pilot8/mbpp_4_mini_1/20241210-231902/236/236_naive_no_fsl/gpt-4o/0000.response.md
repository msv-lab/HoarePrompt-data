Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty or contains a single element. According to the problem description, an empty list or a list with one element should be considered sorted. However, the current implementation will return `True` for an empty list and a single element list, but it does not explicitly check these cases. 

For example:
- If we call `func_1([])`, it returns `True`, which is correct.
- If we call `func_1([5])`, it also returns `True`, which is correct.

However, the function does not have any explicit handling or documentation for these edge cases, and it could be argued that the function is incomplete without a clear specification that it handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly. 

Additionally, if we consider a case where the input is a list with duplicate elements, such as `func_1([1, 1, 1])`, the function will return `True`, which is also correct as duplicates do not violate the sorted condition. 

Thus, the function is not incorrect in its logic, but it lacks explicit handling or documentation for edge cases, leading to a conclusion that it is not fully compliant with the problem description.
