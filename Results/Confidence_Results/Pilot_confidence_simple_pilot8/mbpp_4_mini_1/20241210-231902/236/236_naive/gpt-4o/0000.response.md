Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding any such case, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The provided assertions test various cases, including:
- A sorted list, which returns `True`.
- An unsorted list with a decreasing element, which returns `False`.
- Another unsorted list with a decreasing sequence, which returns `False`.

Since all potential cases are handled correctly, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
