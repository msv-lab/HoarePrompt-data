Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list. It uses a generator expression to check if each element in the list is an instance of `int`, and the `sum` function counts the `True` values generated (which represent the integer elements). 

The program will handle various cases, including:
- An empty list, which will return 0.
- A list with no integers, which will also return 0.
- A list with mixed data types, accurately counting only the integers.

Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
