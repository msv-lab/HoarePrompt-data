Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case for the month of February (month 2). According to the problem description, the function should check whether a given month contains 30 days. However, February has 28 days in common years and 29 days in leap years, so it should return False. The program does correctly identify that months 4, 6, 9, and 11 have 30 days, but it fails to account for the fact that months like January (31 days), March (31 days), May (31 days), July (31 days), August (31 days), October (31 days), and December (31 days) should also return False when checked for having 30 days. 

In summary, the program only checks if the month is in the set of months with 30 days but does not handle the complete requirement of identifying which months have 30 days. For example, `func_1(1)` (January) and `func_1(3)` (March) should return False, but they are not handled by the current implementation.
