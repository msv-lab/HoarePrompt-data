Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. The list `thirty_days_months` includes the months that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function checks if the input `month` is in this list and returns `True` for those months and `False` for others. 

All potential cases are handled correctly:
- For month 4, it returns `True`.
- For month 6, it returns `True`.
- For month 9, it returns `True`.
- For month 11, it returns `True`.
- For month 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), 12 (December), it returns `False`.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.
