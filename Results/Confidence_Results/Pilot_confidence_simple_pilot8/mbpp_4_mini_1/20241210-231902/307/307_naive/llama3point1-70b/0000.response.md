To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function initializes `idx` to 1 and enters an infinite loop.
2. Inside the loop, it calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. It checks the number of digits in the triangular number by converting it to a string and using `len()`.
4. If the number of digits is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns the current index `idx`.
5. If not, it increments `idx` and continues the loop.

**Potential Cases:**
- For `n = 1`, the first triangular number is 1 (which has 1 digit), and it should return 1.
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number is 3 (which has 1 digit); the next is 6 (which has 1 digit); then 10 (which has 2 digits), and it should return 4.
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number is 6 (which has 1 digit); 10 (2 digits); 15 (2 digits); 21 (2 digits); 28 (2 digits); 36 (2 digits); 45 (2 digits); 55 (2 digits); 66 (2 digits); 78 (2 digits); 91 (2 digits); 105 (3 digits), and it should return 14.

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than 1, the function does not handle this case. For example, if `n = 0`, there is no triangular number with 0 digits, and the function would enter an infinite loop since it would never find a triangular number with 0 digits.

Since the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1 and would run indefinitely in such scenarios, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
