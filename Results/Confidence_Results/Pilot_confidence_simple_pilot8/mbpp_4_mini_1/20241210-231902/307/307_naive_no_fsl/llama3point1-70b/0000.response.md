Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the program works:
1. It initializes `idx` to 1, which represents the current index of the triangular number being calculated.
2. It enters an infinite loop where it calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. It then checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. If the condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`, which is the desired result.
5. If not, it increments `idx` and repeats the process.

The program will correctly find the first triangular number with at least `n` digits for any positive integer `n`. There are no edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the problem description, as it handles all possible values of `n` correctly.
