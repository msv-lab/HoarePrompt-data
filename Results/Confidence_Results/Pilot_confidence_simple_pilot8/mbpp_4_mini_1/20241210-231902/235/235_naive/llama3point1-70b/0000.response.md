Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates through each character (digit), converts them back to integers, and sums them up. 

All potential cases are handled:
- For a non-negative integer input, it will correctly return the sum of its digits.
- If the input is `0`, the sum will be `0`, which is correct.
- If the input is a multi-digit number, it will accurately sum all the digits.

There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements.
