Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. 

1. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
2. It initializes a variable `total` to zero, which will hold the sum of the digits.
3. It uses a while loop to iterate as long as `n` is greater than zero:
   - Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) to `total`.
   - It then removes the last digit from `n` (using integer division `n //= 10`).
4. Once `n` becomes zero, the loop ends, and the function returns the total sum of the digits.

The assertions provided test the function with various non-negative integers, and all expected results are correct:
- For `345`, the sum of digits is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
- For `12`, the sum of digits is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- For `97`, the sum of digits is `9 + 7 = 16`.

Additionally, the function handles the edge case of `0`, which would correctly return `0` since there are no digits to sum.

Since no potential cases where the function does not behave as expected can be identified, the function is correct for the problem description.
