Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element, checks if the element is present in the array, and returns a tuple containing:

1. A boolean indicating whether the element is found (`True` if found, `False` otherwise).
2. The index of the element if it is found, or `-1` if it is not.

The use of `array.index(element)` will raise a `ValueError` if the element is not found, which is appropriately handled in the `except` block. The program correctly returns `(False, -1)` in this case.

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including:
- When the element is present in the array.
- When the element is not present in the array.
- When the array is empty.

Thus, there are no identified issues or edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.
