Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element, and it returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is present in the array, along with the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function uses `enumerate` to iterate through the array, checking each value against the specified element. If a match is found, it returns `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. 

The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as when the element is not found in the array, by returning the appropriate tuple `(False, -1)`.

Since I cannot find any input or potential case where the function does not meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
