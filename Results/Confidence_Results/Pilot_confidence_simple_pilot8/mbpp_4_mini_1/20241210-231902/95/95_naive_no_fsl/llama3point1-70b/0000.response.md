Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(s)` uses the string method `count()` to accurately count the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. 

Here are the reasons why the code is correct for all potential cases:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The `count()` method is case-sensitive, which aligns with the assumption that we are counting the exact substring 'std'. If the input string contains 'Std' or 'STD', it will not be counted, which is the expected behavior.

2. **Empty String**: If the input string is empty (`''`), the function will return `0`, which is correct since there are no occurrences of 'std'.

3. **No Occurrences**: If the input string does not contain 'std' at all, the function will return `0`, which is again correct.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**: If the input string contains multiple instances of 'std', the function will return the correct count.

5. **Overlapping Occurrences**: The `count()` method does not count overlapping occurrences, which is also the expected behavior for counting substrings.

Since the function behaves correctly for all possible inputs as described, the conclusion is that the implementation meets the requirements of the problem statement.
