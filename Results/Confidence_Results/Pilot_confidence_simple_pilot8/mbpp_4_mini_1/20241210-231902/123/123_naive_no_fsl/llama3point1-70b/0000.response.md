To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(lst, L)`.

The problem description states that the function should split a given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and return the resulting lists in a tuple.

The implementation of the function is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Slicing the List**: The function uses list slicing to create two parts:
   - `lst[:L]` gives the first part of the list with length `L`.
   - `lst[L:]` gives the second part of the list starting from index `L`.
   
2. **Behavior with Different Values of `L`**:
   - If `L` is less than 0, Python's slicing will return an empty list for the first part, and the full list for the second part (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` results in `([], [1, 2, 3])`).
   - If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first part will be the entire list, and the second part will be empty (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` results in `([1, 2, 3], [])`).
   - If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first part will be the entire list and the second part will be empty as well (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], 3)` results in `([1, 2, 3], [])`).
   - If `L` is 0, the first part will be empty, and the second part will be the entire list (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` results in `([], [1, 2, 3])`).

### Edge Cases:
- **Negative Values of `L`**: The function does not handle the case where `L` is negative in a way that might be expected (e.g., it does not raise an error).
- **Values of `L` Greater Than List Length**: The function handles this correctly by returning the entire list in the first part and an empty list in the second part.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves as expected according to the problem description for all tested cases, including edge cases. Since there are no instances where the function fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
