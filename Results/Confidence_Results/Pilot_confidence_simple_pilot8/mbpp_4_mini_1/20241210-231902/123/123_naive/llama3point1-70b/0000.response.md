To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program against the requirements.

### Problem description:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
2. **Slicing**: It uses slicing to create two parts of the list:
   - The first part is `lst[:L]`, which takes the first `L` elements from the list.
   - The second part is `lst[L:]`, which takes the elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

### Potential Cases:
- **Case 1**: When `L` is 0. The function should return `(lst[:0], lst[0:])`, which results in `([], lst)`. This is correct.
- **Case 2**: When `L` is greater than the length of the list. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = 5`, the function should return `([1, 2, 3], [])`. This is also correct.
- **Case 3**: When `L` is equal to the length of the list. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = 3`, the function should return `([1, 2, 3], [])`. This is correct as well.
- **Case 4**: When `L` is negative. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = -1`, the function should return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is also correct since slicing handles negative indices by returning the entire list from the start.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided cases and the functionality of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
