To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Case when `list1` is non-empty:**
   - The code checks if `list1` is non-empty (`if list1:`).
   - If it is non-empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire `list2` using slicing (`list1[-1:] = list2`).
   - This means if `list1` had more than one element, it will effectively reduce the length of `list1` by 1 and append all elements of `list2` at the end.

2. **Case when `list1` is empty:**
   - If `list1` is empty, the program attempts to set `list1` to `list2` (`list1 = list2`).
   - However, this does not modify the original `list1` passed to the function; it merely assigns a new reference to the local variable `list1`. The original list outside the function remains unchanged.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Case 1:** If `list1` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `list2` is `[4, 5]`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. The program works correctly here.
  
- **Case 2:** If `list1` is empty (`[]`) and `list2` is `[4, 5]`, the expected output should be `[4, 5]`. However, because of the assignment `list1 = list2`, the original `list1` remains unchanged outside the function. This means the function does not fulfill the requirement to replace the last element when `list1` is empty.

- **Case 3:** If `list1` is `[1]` and `list2` is `[4, 5]`, the expected output should be `[4, 5]`, but the program will return `[4, 5]` as the last element of `list1` is replaced, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in the edge case where `list1` is empty. The requirement states that it should replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`, but it does not modify the original `list1` when it is empty.

Correctness: **False**.
