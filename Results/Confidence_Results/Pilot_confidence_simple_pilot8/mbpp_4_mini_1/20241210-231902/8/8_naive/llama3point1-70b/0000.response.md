To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description, which states that the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The program uses `s.find(char)` to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(char)` to get the index of the last occurrence of the character.

2. **Removing Occurrences**:
   - If both occurrences are found and they are the same (meaning the character appears only once), it removes that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, it constructs a new string by concatenating:
     - The substring before the first occurrence.
     - The substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding both).
     - The substring after the last occurrence.

3. **Handling Cases**:
   - If the character is not found in the string, it simply returns the original string.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- If the input string is empty, the function should return an empty string.
- If the character to remove does not exist in the string, the function should return the original string.
- If the character exists only once in the string, it should be removed correctly.
- If the character exists multiple times, both first and last occurrences should be removed correctly.

### Potential Issue:
Consider the case where the input string is "abcde" and the character is 'f'. The expected output is "abcde" since 'f' does not exist in the string. The program correctly handles this case.

Now, consider the case where the input string is "aabbcc" and the character is 'a'. The expected output should be "abbc" since the first 'a' (index 0) and the last 'a' (index 1) should be removed. The program correctly constructs the string by concatenating the parts.

However, if we take the input string "aa" with the character 'a', the expected output should be an empty string, but the program will return "a" because it only removes one occurrence of 'a' at the beginning and does not handle the case where both occurrences are the same properly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle certain cases, specifically when the character occurs only twice in the string, which should lead to an empty string. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
