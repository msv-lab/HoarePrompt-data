To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(nums)` and see if it correctly finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

The program works as follows:
1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0.
2. It sorts the list `nums`.
3. It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where each element starts with a value of 1, as each number can at least form a subset of itself.
4. It uses two nested loops: the outer loop iterates through each number in the sorted list, while the inner loop checks each previous number to see if the current number is divisible by it. If it is, it updates the `dp` list to reflect the maximum size of the subset that can be formed with the current number.
5. Finally, it returns the maximum value found in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest subset.

Now, let's consider edge cases and potential issues:
- The program does not handle cases where all numbers in the list are the same, such as `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The expected output is 4 since all pairs are divisible, but the program would correctly return 4 in this case.
- The program also appears to handle cases with negative numbers correctly, as sorting will place them in the correct order, and the divisibility check will still function as expected (e.g., `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]` should return 4).
- However, if the input list contains a mix of positive and negative numbers, such as `[-1, 1, 2, 4]`, the program would return 3 because it would count `[-1, 1, 2]` as the largest subset, which is incorrect since `-1` is not divisible by `2`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically when considering negative numbers and their divisibility with positive numbers. 

Correctness: **False**.
