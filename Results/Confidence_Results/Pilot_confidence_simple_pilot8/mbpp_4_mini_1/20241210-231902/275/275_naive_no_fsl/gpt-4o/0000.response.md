To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and consider various potential test cases.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible by one another.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the input list, which is a valid step to facilitate checking for divisibility.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` tracks the size of the largest subset that ends with `nums[i]`.
3. **Nested Loop for Divisibility**: The outer loop iterates through each number, while the inner loop checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If so, it updates the `dp` array accordingly.
4. **Return Statement**: Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the largest subset size.

### Test Cases:
The provided assertions in the code can be analyzed:
- `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])` should return `4`. The valid subset could be `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.
- `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])` should return `3`. The valid subset could be `[5, 10, 20]`.
- `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])` should return `4`. The valid subset could again be `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.

### Edge Cases:
To determine if the function is robust, we should consider additional test cases:
- **Empty List**: `func_1([])` should return `0`, which is handled correctly.
- **Single Element**: `func_1([5])` should return `1`, which is also handled correctly.
- **All Elements Coprime**: `func_1([2, 3, 5, 7])` should return `1` since no two numbers are divisible by one another.
- **Multiple Elements with Divisibility**: `func_1([1, 2, 4, 8])` should return `4` since all numbers are divisible by `1`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided function and considering various test cases, including edge cases, I found that the function behaves correctly in all tested scenarios. It correctly identifies the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

Thus, the final evaluation of the program's correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
