Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression that iterates through each item in the list and checks if it is equal to the `element`. 

This implementation handles various potential edge cases as follows:
- If the list is empty, `all()` returns `True`, which is consistent with the idea that "all items" in an empty list can be considered equal to any element.
- If the list contains a single item, it checks if that single item is equal to the `element`, which is also correct.
- If the list contains multiple items, it verifies that every single item matches the `element`.

Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs according to the problem description.
