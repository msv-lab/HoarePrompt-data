Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse order, checking each element to see if it matches the target. If a match is found, it returns the index of that element. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.

The logic handles various cases:
1. If the target is present in the array, it returns the index of the last occurrence.
2. If the target is not present in the array, it correctly returns -1.
3. It works for arrays of various lengths, including empty arrays.

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the code does not perform as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
