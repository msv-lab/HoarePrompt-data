Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adequately handle the case when `m` (the number of elements per group) is greater than `n` (the length of the input list `a`). In such a scenario, the loop that attempts to calculate `current_sum` and `current_cost` will not execute because the condition `if i + 1 >= m:` will never be satisfied. This results in `max_cost` remaining `0`, which may not be the intended output, as the program effectively does not process any elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 2
m = 3
k = 1
a = [1, 2]
```
Here, `m` is greater than `n`, so the loop will never execute any calculations, and the function will return `0`. However, the problem description (though not explicitly given) likely expects some sort of result based on the input values, which is not fulfilled in this case.

Thus, the program fails to account for this case, leading to incorrect behavior.
