Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check if a set of rectangles can form a perfect square when combined. However, there are several potential issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of min_y and max_y**: The program incorrectly calculates `min_y` using `y1` and `max_y` using `y2`. Instead, it should determine the minimum y-coordinate and maximum y-coordinate from both the bottom-left and top-right corners, which is not being done here. This could lead to a situation where the bounding box is incorrectly calculated.

2. **Missing Handling for Non-overlapping Rectangles**: The program assumes that all rectangles must overlap perfectly to form a square. However, it does not handle cases where rectangles are non-overlapping, even if they could fit into a perfect square configuration. For example, if two rectangles are positioned such that their union could still form a square, the program would incorrectly return "NO".

3. **Edge Case for Zero Area**: The program does not handle the case when there are no rectangles (`n = 0`). According to the logic, it will attempt to compute minimum and maximum values from an empty list, which will result in a `ValueError`.

4. **Single Rectangle Cases**: If only one rectangle is provided that is not square, the program will incorrectly evaluate it.

Given these issues, the program does not consistently meet the requirements and will fail for at least one input case, thus it is classified as incorrect.
