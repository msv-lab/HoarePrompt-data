Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find the minimum number of operations needed to remove digits from a number `n` in order to obtain a perfect square. However, there are several issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not check for invalid input cases such as negative numbers or non-integer values. For instance, if the input is `-4`, the program will incorrectly attempt to process it as a valid number.

2. **Edge Case for Single Digit**: For inputs like `0`, `1`, or `2`, the program does not correctly handle the case where no digits might need to be removed to form a perfect square. Specifically, it should return `0` for `0` and `1`, as they are already perfect squares.

3. **Leading Zeros**: While the program checks for leading zeros, it does not account for cases where all digits could be removed resulting in an empty string. The program would then incorrectly treat this as an invalid case (due to the check on `num_str` being non-empty) and may not return valid output for certain inputs.

4. **Missing Imported Module**: The program uses `math.sqrt` without importing the `math` module, which will lead to a runtime error when executing the code.

5. **Inefficient Search Space**: The nested loops that attempt to generate substrings may not efficiently cover all potential combinations of removing digits to find perfect squares, leading to missed valid perfect squares.

6. **Unclear Output Logic**: The return values of `-1` or the minimum number of operations could be misleading. The specification of the problem description (not provided here) would clarify the expected behavior, but the program's logic is not robust enough to ensure correct results across all valid inputs.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements that would be expected based on a typical problem description regarding finding perfect squares that can be formed by removing digits from `n`.
