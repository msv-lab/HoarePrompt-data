Correctness: **True**

The program takes four integers as input and checks whether it is possible to split them into two groups with equal sums. Here's the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads four integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Total Calculation**: It computes the total sum of the four integers.

3. **Even Check**: It first checks if the total sum is even. If it is not, it immediately outputs 'NO', as it is impossible to split an odd number into two equal integer parts.

4. **Pair Sum Check**: If the total is even, it calculates half of the total and checks if any pair of the four integers has a sum equal to half. This is done by checking all possible pairs (a1 + a2, a1 + a3, a1 + a4, a2 + a3, a2 + a4, a3 + a4).

5. **Output Decision**: If any pair sums to half of the total, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The logic implemented correctly addresses the problem of determining whether it's possible to partition the four integers into two groups of equal sum, given that the total must be even for such a partition to be possible. 

No edge cases or potential scenarios can be identified where the program fails to adhere to the problem's requirements, as it effectively checks all necessary conditions.
