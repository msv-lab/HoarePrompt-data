Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to process a word and manipulate it based on the presence of vowels and consonants. However, there are several potential cases where the program does not work as expected:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function `func_3` checks for sequences of consonants and vowels but fails to handle edge cases where the word might consist entirely of vowels or consonants. For instance:
   - Input: `"aaa"` (only vowels)
     - Expected Output: `""` (nothing should be returned)
     - Actual Output: `"aaa"` (the entire input is returned)

2. **Incorrect Handling of Consonant Sequences**: The condition `if i - start >= 3 and func_2(word[start:i])` checks if there are at least three consonants in a row, but the logic to append the results is flawed. 
   - Input: `"bcde"` (four consonants)
     - Expected Output: `"bc d e"` (should break down into pairs and singles)
     - Actual Output: `"bc de"` (only the first two consonants are considered)

These examples demonstrate that the program does not consistently adhere to the requirements implied by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
