Correctness: **False**

The provided program seems to attempt to assess whether there are exactly two unique numbers in a list of cards, each appearing exactly half the time in the list. However, it does not handle all potential edge cases correctly.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
The expected output is `YES` and the numbers `2 1` (or `1 2`, since the order isn't specified). The program would correctly output `YES` and display the numbers.

However, consider the case where there are only one unique number:
```
2
1
1
```
The program correctly outputs `NO`, as expected.

Now consider an edge case with odd counts:
```
3
1
1
2
```
In this case, the program will output `NO`, but it could be argued that it should also state something about the odd distribution of numbers.

Another edge case is when there are more than two unique numbers and their counts are not equal:
```
5
1
2
2
3
3
```
The program will output `NO`, but it fails to check if there are exactly two numbers present in half of the input. It only checks for the last two unique numbers in sorted order.

Thus, the code does not correctly account for all scenarios as described in the problem statement, leading to inconsistencies in the output for various valid inputs.
