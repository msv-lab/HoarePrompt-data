Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks if a number is prime. The function correctly handles the identification of prime numbers based on the conditions defined for primality. It checks for edge cases (e.g., numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime, and specific conditions for numbers less than or equal to 3). 

The main part of the program takes an integer input `n`, and for each integer `m` in the range 1 to 1000, it checks if `n * m + 1` is not prime using the `func_1` function. If it finds such an `m`, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

Since there are no specific problem requirements provided, and the code correctly identifies prime numbers and adheres to the expected logic of checking multiples of `n` to find the smallest `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, it functions as expected across all potential inputs.

Thus, I could not find any cases where the code fails to meet the requirements, leading me to conclude that the program is indeed correct.
