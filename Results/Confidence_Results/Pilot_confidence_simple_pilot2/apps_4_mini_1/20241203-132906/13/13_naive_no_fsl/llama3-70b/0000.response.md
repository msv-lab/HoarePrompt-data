Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to compute the maximum beauty of a string given a sequence of 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver) characters, with the option of swapping one 'S' with a 'G' to potentially increase beauty. However, the program has the following issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input with No 'G's**: If the input string contains no 'G's at all (e.g., "SSSS"), the program will still attempt to calculate beauty, leading to incorrect results because it assumes that there are 'G's to count.

2. **Failure to Count Beauty Correctly on Edge Cases**: The logic intended to count how many 'G's can be connected through one swap does not handle cases properly where multiple 'S's exist between 'G's. For example, in the string "GSSG", the program does not correctly calculate the potential beauty after a swap.

3. **Missing Logic for Complete Edge Cases**: If the input is a single character like 'G' or 'S', the program does not handle these trivial cases properly, potentially leading to an index error or incorrect output.

For example, for input:
```
4
SSSS
```
The program will calculate `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` but will fail to handle it correctly since there are no 'G's present, leading to an output of 0 instead of a clear error or appropriate handling.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all possible edge cases, confirming its incorrectness.
