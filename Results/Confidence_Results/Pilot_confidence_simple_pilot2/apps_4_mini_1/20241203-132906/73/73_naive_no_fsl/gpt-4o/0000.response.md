Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical issue in the `func_1` function that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Specifically, the handling of the case when the length of the `ribbon` is equal to `max_freq` and `n` is 1 may not cover all suitable scenarios for calculating beauty. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
3
aaa bbb ccc
```
Here, `n` is 3, and the ribbons are `"aaa"`, `"bbb"`, and `"ccc"`. 

- For the `kuro_ribbon ("aaa")`, `max_freq` is 3 (the count of 'a'), and `len(ribbon)` equals `max_freq`. Thus, according to the code logic, it would return `max_freq - 1`, which is `2`.
- For the `shiro_ribbon ("bbb")`, the same logic applies, and it would also return `2`.
- For the `katie_ribbon ("ccc")`, it would similarly return `2`.

Here, all ribbons yield a beauty of `2`, leading the program to determine a "Draw". 

Now, if we change the input slightly:
```
1
a b c
```
- For `kuro_ribbon ("a")`, `max_freq` is 1, and since `len(ribbon)` equals `max_freq` and `n` is 1, it will return `max_freq - 1`, which is `0`.
- For `shiro_ribbon ("b")`, the output will also be `0`.
- For `katie_ribbon ("c")`, it will return `0`.

In this case, the program would again print "Draw" for ribbons with equal beauty. However, the logic in `func_1` does not account for how lower values of `n` can lead to misleading outcomes for ribbons, especially when they are not properly accounted for their frequencies against `n`.

Thus, there exist potential cases where the program does not correctly determine the beauty scores for all input scenarios, leading to an overall conclusion that the program is not working correctly in all potential cases.
