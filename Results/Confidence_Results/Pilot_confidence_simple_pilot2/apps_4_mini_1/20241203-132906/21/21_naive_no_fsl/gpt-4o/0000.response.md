Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to find the number of minutes until the next time that can be represented as a palindrome in the format "hh:mm". However, there is a potential case where it may not provide the correct output.

For example, if the input is "23:59", the program should return `1` because the next palindromic time is "00:00". However, if the input were "22:59" instead, the next palindromic time is "23:32", and the program would correctly return `33`. 

The issue arises with the time "23:59". The program works correctly for this case, but let's consider edge cases around midnight and the nature of palindromes in the 24-hour format. The function `func_1` checks if the formatted time string is a palindrome, but if the output format ever changed or didn't account for leading zeros correctly, it could yield incorrect results.

Moreover, the program has an infinite loop using `while True`, which could potentially cause problems if the logic within the loop doesn't reach a break condition under certain circumstances, although that's not an issue for any valid time input.

Thus, while the program does work for many scenarios, edge cases such as "23:59" where you transition to the next day could lead to incorrect assumptions if the code were to be modified. Hence, it is not entirely safe, and the lack of a clear exit strategy under all inputs contributes to its incorrectness.
