Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that cause it to not meet the requirements for certain inputs. One critical issue is the lack of handling for cases where the input values do not meet the conditions expected by the logic flow.

For example, consider the following input:

```
n = 10
m = 1
k = 2
f = 5
```

In this case, the program would compute `gcd` as 2. It then calculates `n_floor` as `(10 - 1) // (2 // 2) + 1`, which results in `10`. However, `f` is 5, which means the condition `if n_floor == f` will not hold true. The program will reach the `print(-1)` statement, which indicates that no valid solution was found.

However, if we consider the case where `n` is smaller than the values represented by `k`, for example:

```
n = 1
m = 1
k = 2
f = 1
```

Here, `gcd` would again be 2, and the calculation for `n_floor` results in `(1 - 1) // (2 // 2) + 1`, which results in `1`. The program would correctly print `1`.

The problem arises when the combination of `n`, `k`, and `f` leads to scenarios where the logic does not hold, especially when `n` is less than the values represented by `k`. There are valid cases where the output is not correctly determined, hence the program is incorrect. 

Thus, since there are potential inputs for which the program does not function as required, the overall correctness is deemed **False**.
