To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code step by step.

The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers called `ticket`. It then checks if it's possible to partition the `ticket` list into at least two segments such that the sum of each segment is equal.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the function `func_1`:

1. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the list.
2. **Odd Sum Check**: If the total sum is odd, it immediately returns `False`, as it's impossible to split an odd number into two equal parts.
3. **Target Sum**: If even, it calculates the target sum (which is half of the total sum).
4. **Segment Counting**: It iterates through the list, adding numbers to a current sum (`curr_sum`). Each time `curr_sum` matches the target sum, it resets `curr_sum` and increments the segment count.
5. **Final Check**: Finally, it checks if the number of segments formed is at least 2.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The code uses `map(int, input())` which may not correctly read the input if the input is not in the expected format. If the input is not space-separated, this could cause issues.
2. **Edge Cases**: 
    - If the input `ticket` is empty or has values that cannot form two segments summing to the target, it will return `NO`, which seems correct, but needs testing.
    - There could be cases where the total sum is even, but the `ticket` list does not provide enough numbers to create at least two segments. For example, `ticket = [1, 1]` should return `NO`, but it may return `YES` as it can form one segment with the target sum.

### Example Case:
- For `ticket = [1, 1]`: 
  - Total sum = 2 (even)
  - Target sum = 1
  - It would find one segment (1) and count it, which is not enough to meet the requirement of at least 2 segments.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the input can have an even sum but cannot create at least two partitions of the target sum.

Correctness: **False**
