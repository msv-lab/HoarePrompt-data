Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` appears to implement a dynamic programming approach to solve a problem related to antennas. However, there are several issues in the logic that lead to incorrect behavior for certain cases.

1. **Initialization of `dp` Array**: The `dp` array is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is correct for representing unreachable states, but the logic that updates `dp` in the nested loops seems flawed. Specifically, handling the `right` and `left` conditions does not guarantee that all reachable states are updated properly.

2. **Accessing and Updating `dp[j]`**: The way the `dp` values are updated within the nested loops does not account for all possible updates correctly. Particularly, in the first loop, the use of `max(0, left - 1)` can lead to incorrect values being assigned to `dp[j]`.

3. **Edge Cases**: There are likely edge cases that are not handled. For example:
   - If there are no antennas (`n = 0`), the program should return `-1`, which it currently does not handle explicitly. 
   - The condition when `m` is `0` (no range to cover) might lead to unexpected results because the logic assumes there is always a range to be covered.

4. **Missing Cases**: If the input `antennas` has overlapping ranges, the current implementation may fail to correctly combine their coverage resulting in incorrect minimum values in `dp`.

To illustrate one specific case of failure:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 5`, `antennas = [(1, 1), (4, 1)]`
- Expected output should be `2` (by using antenna 1 to cover positions 0, 1, and 2 and antenna 2 to cover positions 4 and 5), but the logic in the nested loops may not handle this correctly due to the way boundaries are set.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements comprehensively for all potential cases. Thus, the correctness is marked as **False**.
