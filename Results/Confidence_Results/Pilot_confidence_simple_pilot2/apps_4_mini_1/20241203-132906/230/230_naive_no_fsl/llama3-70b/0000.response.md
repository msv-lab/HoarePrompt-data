Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to determine if the sum of the absolute differences between each number in the list and the median (mid) of the sorted list is even or odd, printing 'YES' if it is even and 'NO' if it is odd. However, there are some issues with the program:

1. **Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median by simply taking the middle element of the sorted array. This approach only works correctly for lists with an odd number of elements. For lists with an even number of elements, the median should be the average of the two middle numbers, which the program does not handle.

2. **Edge Cases**: If `n` is 0 (an empty list), it will cause an error since it tries to access an index of the list. The program does not account for this case and would result in an index error.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
This should calculate the median as `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the program simply takes `3` as the median, leading to incorrect calculations of the sum of absolute differences.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to an incorrect evaluation.
