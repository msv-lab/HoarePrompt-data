Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of shovel pairs whose total costs end with the maximum possible number of nines.

### Explanation of the Issues:
1. **Incorrect Pairing Logic**: The condition inside the `if` statement `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` does not correctly identify when the total cost ends with nines. The logic used is flawed and does not correspond to checking the number of trailing nines after summing the costs of the shovels.

2. **Lack of Maximum Calculation**: The program does not calculate the maximum number of trailing nines that can be achieved, which is the core requirement of the problem. Instead, it arbitrarily checks if the total cost ends with zeroes based on a flawed calculation.

### Counterexample:
For `n = 14`, the expected output is 9, as there are 9 valid shovel pairs whose total costs end with one nine:
- Valid pairs: (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 14), (6, 13), (7, 12), (8, 11), (9, 10).

However, when running the provided code, it will not produce the correct count due to the incorrect logic. 

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the problem's requirements even for common cases, indicating that it is incorrect.
