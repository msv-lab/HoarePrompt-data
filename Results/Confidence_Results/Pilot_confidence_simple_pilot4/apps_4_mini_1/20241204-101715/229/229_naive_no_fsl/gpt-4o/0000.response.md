Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly determines the winner based on whether all piles have the same number of stones. While it's true that if all piles have the same amount, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, the program fails to account for other scenarios where Alice can win. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
In this case, Alice can choose the piles with 3 and 4 stones, remove 2 stones from the pile with 4 (leaving it with 2) and 1 stone from the pile with 3 (leaving it with 2). This way, she ensures that in the next round, Bob will have to choose among 1, 2, and 2 piles, effectively giving her a winning strategy. However, the program will incorrectly return "Alice" because not all piles are equal, and the logic does not take the total stone configurations into consideration. Thus, since the program does not cover all potential winning strategies, it is incorrect.
