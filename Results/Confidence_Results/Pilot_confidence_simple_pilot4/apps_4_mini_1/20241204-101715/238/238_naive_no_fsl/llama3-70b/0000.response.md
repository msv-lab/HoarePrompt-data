To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. There are `n` hobbits and `m` pillows, and Frodo sleeps on the `k`-th bed.
2. Each hobbit needs at least one pillow.
3. No hobbit can have at least two pillows less than any of their neighbors.
4. We need to find the maximum number of pillows Frodo can have.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and computes the number of pillows Frodo can have based on two conditions:

1. For `k == 1` (Frodo is on the first bed):
   ```python
   print(min(m // n, m - (n - 1)))
   ```
   - `m // n` gives the average number of pillows if distributed equally.
   - `m - (n - 1)` ensures that Frodo has enough pillows after giving at least one to each of the `n-1` other hobbits.

2. For `k > 1` (Frodo is not on the first bed):
   ```python
   print(min(m // n + 1, m - (n - k)))
   ```
   - `m // n + 1` allows Frodo to potentially have one more pillow than the average if there are enough left.
   - `m - (n - k)` ensures that after giving pillows to the hobbits to the left of Frodo, he still has enough pillows.

### Edge Cases and Testing:
To check if the program works correctly for all cases, we can introduce a few scenarios:

1. **Edge Case - Minimum Values**:
   ```
   Input: 1 1 1
   Expected Output: 1 (Frodo can take the only pillow available)
   ```

2. **Edge Case - Large Number of Pillows**:
   ```
   Input: 5 15 3
   Expected Output: 3 (Each hobbit can take 3 pillows, no one is hurt)
   ```

3. **Edge Case - Not Enough Pillows**:
   ```
   Input: 4 5 2
   Expected Output: 1 (Frodo can only take 1 pillow, so others can have 1 each)
   ```

4. **Edge Case - Maximum Distribution**:
   ```
   Input: 3 8 1
   Expected Output: 4 (If Frodo takes 4, the others can take 2 each)
   ```

#### Finding a Failing Case:
Let's examine an edge case where `m` is significantly larger than `n` and test the program:

- **Case Where m is Excessively Large**:
   ```
   Input: 3 1000 2
   Expected Output: 499 (Frodo can take 499, while others can take 500)
   Actual Output: Should return min(333 + 1, 1000 - 1) = min(334, 998) = 334
   ```

This suggests that the logic used for `k > 1` may not account adequately for the maximum pillows Frodo can take when there are many pillows available. Thus, it can lead to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, especially when `m` is much larger than `n`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
