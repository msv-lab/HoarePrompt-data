To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze if it accurately finds the three points satisfying the given conditions and correctly handles various edge cases.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. Vasya needs to find three integer points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)` within the specified bounds.
2. The area of the triangle formed by these points must equal `nm/k`.
3. If it's impossible to find such points, the output should be "NO", otherwise "YES" followed by the points.

### Key Parts of the Program:
1. **Area Calculation Check**: It first checks if `n * m % k` equals zero. If not, it implies that `nm/k` is not an integer, hence it immediately prints "NO".
2. **Finding Points**: The program uses the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find two integers `n1` and `m1` such that `n1 * m + m1 * n = gcd(n, m)`.
3. **Conditions Check**: It checks whether the calculated points are within bounds and prints them or prints "NO" if not possible.

### Potential Cases to Test:
1. **Basic Valid Input**: Let's consider `n=4, m=3, k=3`. The area would be `4 * 3 / 3 = 4`, and the output from the program is valid since it generates points that form a triangle of area 4.
   
2. **No Valid Area**: For the input `n=4, m=4, k=7`, the area `16/7` is not an integer and the program correctly outputs "NO".

3. **Boundary Case**: For `n=1, m=1, k=2`, the area calculates to `1 * 1 / 2 = 0.5`, which is not an integer and should correctly return "NO". 

4. **Large Values**: For `n=10^9, m=10^9, k=2`, the area computes to `5*10^18`, which is valid, and the program needs to ensure the points generated are within bounds.

### Identifying a Potential Problem:
While the program checks if `n * m % k` equals zero, it does not thoroughly verify the bounds of the output points after calculating them through the Extended Euclidean approach. There can be situations where, due to the nature of the integers involved, the generated points `(0, n1 * m // g)` or `(m1 * m // g, 0)` could exceed the bounds of `n` or `m`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not explicitly handle all edge cases regarding bounds after calculating potential points, there exists a case where it could output points that are out of bounds. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
