To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the code attempts to determine if an array is unimodal, and then consider various edge cases.

The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the array is unimodal by performing the following steps:
1. It increments `i` while the current element is less than the next (i.e., identifying the strictly increasing section).
2. It increments `i` while the current element is equal to the next (i.e., identifying the constant section).
3. It increments `i` while the current element is greater than the next (i.e., identifying the strictly decreasing section).
4. Finally, it checks if `i` has reached `n - 1`, which would mean the end of the array was reached correctly.

### Testing Edge Cases

1. **Test Case: All elements the same**
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Actual Output: `YES` (correct)

2. **Test Case: Strictly increasing followed by constant, then strictly decreasing**
   - Input: `1 2 2 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Actual Output: `YES` (correct)

3. **Test Case: Strictly decreasing followed by constant, then strictly increasing**
   - Input: `3 2 2 2 5`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Actual Output: `NO` (correct)

4. **Test Case: Strictly increasing repeated values, then increasing again**
   - Input: `1 2 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Actual Output: `NO` (correct)

5. **Test Case: Random unimodal configuration**
   - Input: `1 5 5 5 4 2`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Actual Output: `YES` (correct)

### Conclusion
The program successfully handles various edge cases that can arise from the logic described in the problem statement. The function correctly identifies the three segments (increasing, constant, and decreasing) and validates the unimodal condition.

Therefore, after careful consideration of potential edge cases and scenarios, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly determines if the array is unimodal.

Correctness: **True**
