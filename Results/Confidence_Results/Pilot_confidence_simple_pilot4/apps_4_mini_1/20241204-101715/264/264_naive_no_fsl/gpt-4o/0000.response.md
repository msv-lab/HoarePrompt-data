To analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to ensure that it correctly computes both the minimum and maximum possible values of `k`.

### Understanding the Code:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The first two integers read are `n` (number of benches) and `m` (number of additional people).
   - The next `n` integers represent the number of people currently sitting on each bench in the list `a`.

2. **Calculations**:
   - **Maximum possible `k`**:
     - This is calculated as `initial_max + m`, where `initial_max` is the maximum number of people currently on any bench. This assumes all `m` new people sit on the same bench currently holding the most people.
   - **Minimum possible `k`**:
     - This is calculated using the formula `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n`. Here, `total_people` is the sum of all people currently on the benches, and this expression effectively computes the ceiling of the average occupancy if `m` people are distributed as evenly as possible across all `n` benches.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:

- **Single Bench**: When `n = 1`, the calculation should correctly yield `initial_max + m` for both minimum and maximum `k` values, as all people will sit on the single bench.
  
- **All Benches with Maximum Capacity**: If every bench starts with the maximum allowed people (100), and `m` is large, the maximum `k` should still be calculated correctly as `100 + m`.

- **Uneven Distribution of Initial People**: If the benches are highly unevenly populated, the minimum `k` should still be calculated correctly to reflect the distribution of additional people.

### Testing Example:
Letâ€™s consider the input where:
```
3
7
1
6
5
```
- Current counts: Bench 1 has 1, Bench 2 has 6, Bench 3 has 5.
- `initial_max` = 6
- `total_people` = 1 + 6 + 5 = 12
- Maximum `k`: `initial_max + m` = `6 + 7` = 13
- Minimum `k`: `(total_people + m + n - 1) // n` = `(12 + 7 + 3 - 1) // 3` = `21 // 3` = 7

The output should be `7 13`, which matches with what the function outputs.

### Conclusion:

After closely analyzing the code, it adheres to the problem description accurately and computes both minimum and maximum `k` correctly for all provided cases. There are no identified edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
