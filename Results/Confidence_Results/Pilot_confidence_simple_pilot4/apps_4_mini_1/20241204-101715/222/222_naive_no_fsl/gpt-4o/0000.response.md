To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1(n, k)` and see if it meets the requirements for all potential cases.

### Analysis of the Program
1. The function initializes an empty list `positions` to keep track of which skewers are turned.
2. It starts with `i = 1` (the first skewer) and enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. Inside the loop, it appends the current skewer index `i` to the `positions` list.
4. Then, it increments `i` by `2 * k + 1`, which means it skips over `2 * k` skewers after turning over one skewer.
5. Finally, the function prints the number of actions taken (which is the length of `positions`) and the indices of the skewers turned.

### Requirements from the Problem Description
- Each time a skewer is turned, it should also turn over `k` skewers on either side.
- The goal is to minimize the number of actions taken to ensure all skewers are turned over.

### Testing for Edge Cases
Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **Minimum Input Case:** 
   - Input: `n = 1`, `k = 0`
   - Expected Output: 
     - Actions: 1
     - Skewer: 1
   - Program Output: 
     - Actions: 1
     - Skewer: 1
   - The program correctly handles this case.

2. **Maximum Input Case with k = 0:**
   - Input: `n = 1000`, `k = 0`
   - Expected Output: 
     - Actions: 1000
     - Skewers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000
   - Program Output:
     - Actions: 1000
     - Skewers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000
   - The program correctly handles this case.

3. **General Case:**
   - Input: `n = 7`, `k = 2`
   - Expected Output: 
     - Actions: 2
     - Skewers: 1, 6 
   - Program Output:
     - Actions: 2
     - Skewers: 1, 6
   - The program correctly handles this case.

4. **Where `k` is greater than `n`:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `k = 10`
   - Expected Output: 
     - Actions: 1
     - Skewers: 1
   - Program Output:
     - Actions: 1
     - Skewers: 1
   - The program correctly handles this case.

5. **When `k` is 1 and n is even:**
   - Input: `n = 6`, `k = 1`
   - Expected Output: 
     - Actions: 2
     - Skewers: 1, 4
   - Program Output:
     - Actions: 2
     - Skewers: 1, 4
   - The program correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion
After testing multiple edge cases and analyzing the program's logic, it appears that the program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all tested cases. There are no scenarios where it fails to turn over all skewers optimally based on the given constraints `n` and `k`.

Correctness: **True**
