Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to correctly handle certain edge cases related to the splitting of arrays into non-zero sum subarrays. Specifically:

1. **Case with all zeros**: If the input is an array of zeros, e.g., `n = 3` and `A = [0, 0, 0]`, the program will incorrectly print "YES" and produce subarrays, even though the requirement states that any subarray must not sum to zero. In this case, all possible subarrays would sum to zero.

2. **Single element zero**: If the input is a single zero, e.g., `n = 1` and `A = [0]`, the program will output "NO", which is correct. However, other combinations of zeros or cases with zero elements intermixed could lead to incorrect outputs.

To summarize, the program does not sufficiently ensure that all subarrays have a non-zero sum. As a result, it can produce invalid outputs for arrays that contain zeros, making the implementation incorrect for given constraints.
