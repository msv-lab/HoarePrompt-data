Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the longest substring that is not a palindrome according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. It reads a non-empty string `s`.
2. It initializes a variable `max_len` to zero to keep track of the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings.
3. It uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible substrings of `s`.
4. For each substring, it checks if it is not equal to its reverse (which indicates that it is not a palindrome).
5. If the substring is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` to the maximum of its current value and the length of the substring.
6. Finally, it prints `max_len` if it is greater than zero, otherwise it prints `0`.

The program handles all specified cases, including:
- A string that is a palindrome (e.g., "qqqqqqqq") returns `0`.
- A string that is not a palindrome (e.g., "mew") returns its full length.
- A string with characters that repeat but also has non-repeating characters (e.g., "wuffuw") calculates the longest non-palindromic substring correctly.

In all potential cases derived from the problem statement, the program behaves as expected. Therefore, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description correctly.
