Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, it assumes that if there are no pearls (`pearls == 0`), it should print "NO". However, there is a case where all the characters in the input are links (e.g., `---`) and there is no pearl present. In this case, the program would output "NO", which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem description states that if there are no pearls, the number of links between adjacent pearls is trivially equal (since there are no pearls at all). Therefore, if the input string consists only of links, the correct response should be "YES" since there are no two adjacent pearls to compare.

Additionally, the logic within the program does not account for cases where there are an equal number of links and pearls but the distribution makes it impossible to rearrange them correctly (e.g., input `-o---o-`).

For example:
- Input: `---` (only links)
- Expected Output: `YES` (since there are no pearls to separate links)
- Actual Output: `NO` (due to `pearls == 0` condition)

This demonstrates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
