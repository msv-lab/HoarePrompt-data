To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it accurately counts perfectly balanced striped binary search trees (BSTs) based on the given constraints:

1. A BST is perfectly balanced if there doesn't exist a BST with the same number of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths.
2. A striped BST has specific parity relationships between parent and child nodes.

Let's break down the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    MOD = 998244353
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1] * ((i - 1) // j % 2)
            dp[i] %= MOD
    return dp[n]
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```

### Code Analysis
- The `dp` array is initialized to count the number of valid trees for a given number of vertices.
- `dp[0]` is set to `1`, signifying one way to create a tree with zero nodes (the empty tree).
- The outer loop iterates through each possible size of the tree from `1` to `n`.
- The inner loop tries to partition the tree into left and right subtrees, using the `j` index to represent the size of the left subtree. The right subtree would then have `i - j - 1` nodes.
- The multiplication `((i - 1) // j % 2)` attempts to enforce the striped condition based on the index `j`.

### Potential Issues
1. **Counting Mechanism**: The code uses `((i - 1) // j % 2)` which seems to be an attempt to enforce the parity condition, but this approach does not correctly implement the required striped BST logic. Specifically, it uses the index `j` incorrectly to determine tree structures.
  
   For example, if `j` is 0, this will always multiply by zero, which could inadvertently make valid configurations invalid.

2. **Perfectly Balanced Requirement**: The program does not seem to check if the trees are perfectly balanced as per the definition provided. The way trees are constructed doesn't guarantee that they meet the perfect balance requirement directly. 

3. **Edge Case Handling**: It is unclear how the program handles specific small inputs, particularly edge cases like `n=1`, `n=2`, and `n=3`. The problem description suggests that for `n=3`, the output should be `0`, but we should check if the program handles that.

### Testing Specific Inputs
- For `n=1`: Expected output is `1` (only one tree, the root itself).
- For `n=2`: Expected output is `0` (cannot form a striped BST).
- For `n=3`: Expected output is `0` (as noted in the examples).

When running with `n=3`, the inner workings of the `dp` calculation would likely yield a non-zero result due to incorrect parity checks, which leads to the wrong counting of possible trees.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, especially the incorrect handling of the striped condition and the perfect balance requirements, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**
