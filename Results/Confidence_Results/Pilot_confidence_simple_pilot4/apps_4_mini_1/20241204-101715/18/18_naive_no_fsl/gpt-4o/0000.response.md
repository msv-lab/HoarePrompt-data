Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining the number of spectators standing at a given time `t` based on the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it correctly returns `t` because up to time `k`, all spectators are standing sequentially from the first up to the `t`-th spectator.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it returns `k`, which means all `k` spectators are standing since all spectators up to `k` have stood and none have sat down yet.

3. If `t` is greater than `n`, it calculates the number of spectators standing by subtracting `t` from `n + k` (the total number of spectators who stood up) and returns that result. This correctly accounts for those who have started to sit down after `n`.

The program effectively handles all specified cases and adheres to the rules laid out in the problem statement, including the upper limits and transitions between standing and sitting spectators. As such, no counterexamples can be found, confirming that the program is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases given the constraints in the problem.
