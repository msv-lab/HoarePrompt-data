You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.

Assume that we have a cat with a number $x$. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal $2^m - 1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. For example, the numbers $0$, $1$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.

In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on $x$:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer $n$ and replace $x$ with $x \oplus (2^n - 1)$, with $\oplus$ being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace $x$ with $x + 1$. 

The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.

Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most $40$ operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?

Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than $40$ operations.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$).


-----Output-----

The first line should contain a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 40$) — the number of operations to apply.

Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number $n_i$ in it. That is, print $\lceil \frac{t}{2} \rceil$ integers $n_i$ ($0 \le n_i \le 30$), denoting the replacement $x$ with $x \oplus (2^{n_i} - 1)$ in the corresponding step.

If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
39

Output

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test, one of the transforms might be as follows: $39 \to 56 \to 57 \to 62 \to 63$. Or more precisely: Pick $n = 5$. $x$ is transformed into $39 \oplus 31$, or $56$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $57$.  Pick $n = 3$. $x$ is transformed into $57 \oplus 7$, or $62$.  Increase $x$ by $1$, changing its value to $63 = 2^6 - 1$. 

In the second and third test, the number already satisfies the goal requirement.
Program:
```
def func_1(x):
    return x & x + 1 == 0

def func_2(x):
    operations = []
    count = 0
    while not func_1(x) and count < 40:
        if count % 2 == 0:
            n = 0
            while (1 << n) - 1 <= x:
                n += 1
            while n > 0 and x >> n - 1 & 1 == 1:
                n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break
            operations.append(n)
            x ^= (1 << n) - 1
        else:
            x += 1
        count += 1
    return (count, operations)
x = int(input())
(t, ops) = func_2(x)
print(t)
for i in range(0, len(ops), 2):
    print(ops[i], end=' ')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
