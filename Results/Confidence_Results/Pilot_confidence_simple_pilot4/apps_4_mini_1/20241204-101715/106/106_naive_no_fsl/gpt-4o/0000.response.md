Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem of navigating a chessboard with varying chess pieces. However, I found a potential issue with the implementation regarding the handling of moves and piece replacements.

1. **Knight Movement**: The `func_1` function correctly returns the knight's potential moves, but the main logic does not ensure that the knight's moves are only made when they are valid, particularly regarding the order of squares numbered 1 to N^2. There is no explicit handling of scenarios where a knight may jump over pieces or arrive at squares that don't directly lead sequentially to the next required square number.

2. **Bishop and Rook Movement**: The `func_2` and `func_3` functions provide valid movement options for the rook and bishop, respectively, but the implementation does not enforce that the sequence of moves must lead to the specific next square number in the given order (from 1 to N^2). The logic to ensure a valid transition from one numbered square to the next is not robust enough to handle edge cases, such as when the knight, rook, or bishop can move to multiple squares, but none are the next required square.

3. **Replacement Logic**: The code allows for piece replacements, but the manner in which it decides to replace a piece and continue does not guarantee that the chosen piece is appropriate for achieving the next move in the sequence, which might lead to inefficient paths or infinite loops if it continually tries to move without reaching the target square.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 3
6 5 4
7 8 9
```
In this case, the program might not optimally determine the best piece to use after starting with the knight and could end up increasing steps unnecessarily due to ineffective piece replacements or invalid movement choices based on the target order.

Given these considerations, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
