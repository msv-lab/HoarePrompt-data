Correctness: **True**

The program correctly simulates the weight growth of Limak and Bob over the years, following the given rules that Limak's weight triples each year and Bob's weight doubles. The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, and it accurately counts the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob. 

I reviewed the problem description and the provided examples, and the program performs well under all scenarios presented. The edge case of both having a weight of 1 is also handled correctly, as Limak will become heavier than Bob after just one year. Given the constraints provided (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), there are no cases that the program fails to address as it correctly handles all possible input pairs within this range.

Thus, no potential cases exist where the program does not work as expected, confirming its correctness.
