Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases as described in the problem statement. 

A specific case where the program fails can be illustrated by the following input:

```
5 3
0 0 1
1 1 1
2 2 1
3 3 1
4 4 1
```

In this case, we have 5 pieces of meat placed diagonally on the plane, each with the same hardness of 1. The program must determine the optimal position for the heat source such that at least 3 pieces of meat can be cooked in the minimum time. 

However, the logic in `func_1` may not accurately calculate the time required for cooking based on the heat source placement, especially when all meats have the same hardness. The binary search in `func_2` relies on the assumption that the meat pieces will be processed correctly based on the calculated time for each potential heat source position. 

Additionally, the use of `d` and its calculation is rather convoluted and could lead to scenarios where the count of pieces of meat ready does not correctly reflect the optimal solution. 

As a result, the program may output a time that does not satisfy the requirement of having at least K pieces ready, thus it does not satisfy the problem's constraints for all inputs. This indicates that the program is not robust enough to handle all edge cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
