To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the logic based on the problem requirements.

The program takes four integers: 
- N (the total number of different collectible coins)
- M (the number of Ivan's friends)
- K (the number of different coins Ivan currently has)
- L (the minimum number of new coins that must be gifted)

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Calculation of `min_x`**:  
   The program calculates `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to ensure that at least `L` coins are new. The formula used is:
   ```python
   min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
   ```
   This effectively finds the ceiling of `L / M`, ensuring that the total number of new coins gifted is at least `L`.

2. **Condition Check**:  
   The program checks if it is possible for all friends to gift coins such that:
   - The total coins given (`M * min_x`) does not exceed the number of different coins available (`N - K`), which is the number of coins that can potentially be new to Ivan's collection.
   The condition checked is:
   ```python
   if M * min_x <= N - K:
   ```

3. **Output**:  
   If the condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`, otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **All coins are already in Ivan's collection**:  
   If `K == N`, then `N - K = 0`. In this case, if `L > 0`, it is impossible to fulfill the requirement (since there are no new coins), and the output should be `-1`. The program will output `-1` correctly since `M * min_x` will also be greater than `0`.

2. **More friends than possible unique coins**:  
   If `M > N`, the program will output `-1` because there arenâ€™t enough unique coins for each friend. 

3. **Calculating `min_x` when L is larger than the total coins available**:  
   If `L > N - K`, then even if each friend gifts at least one coin, it is impossible to satisfy the requirement of having at least `L` new coins. The current implementation checks this because if `min_x` multiplied by `M` exceeds the remaining coins (`N - K`), it returns `-1`.

### Conclusion

After evaluating these cases, it appears that the current implementation handles the required conditions correctly. The logic used in the function effectively checks for the minimum coins to be gifted per friend while adhering to the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Since I cannot find an input case where the program does not work as expected in accordance with the problem statement, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
