Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. Let's analyze the code:

1. The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input, where:
   - `n` is the total amount of money Vasya has.
   - `a` is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.
   - `b` is the cost of one Bars bar.

2. It uses a loop to iterate through all possible quantities of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`) that Vasya can buy, ranging from `0` to `n // a`.

3. For each possible quantity of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`), it calculates how much money is left after buying `x` bottles (`n - x * a`) and then determines the maximum number of Bars bars (`y`) that can be bought with the remaining money.

4. The condition `if x * a + y * b == n:` checks if the combination of `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and `y` Bars bars exactly equals `n`. If it does, it prints "YES" and the values for `x` and `y`.

5. If no valid combinations are found after the loop, the program prints "NO".

The program is efficient considering the input constraints, and it correctly handles the requirement for non-negative integers. It also allows for multiple valid combinations, satisfying the problem description.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct and functions as expected for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
