To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the key points.

1. **Understanding the Triangle Area Requirement**:
   - The area of a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]
   - The program states that we need the area to be equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The line `if n * m % k:` checks whether \( \frac{nm}{k} \) results in a non-integer (i.e., if \( nm \) is not divisible by \( k \)). If this is the case, the program correctly prints "NO".

3. **Finding Points**:
   - The function `func_3` aims to find coefficients for a linear combination of \( n \) and \( m \) that would yield the correct area.
   - The code attempts to find three points that generate the desired area based on the outputs of `func_3`.

4. **Point Validity Check**:
   - The area condition is checked within the program using `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:`, where \( g \) is derived from the `func_3` function. 
   - The points generated are \( (0, 0) \), \( (0, n1 * m // g) \), and \( (m1 * m // g, 0) \).

5. **Critical Examination**:
   - A potential issue arises when \( g \) needs to be checked against both \( n1 \) and \( m1 \) (the results from `func_3`). If these points are outside the bounds of \( [0, n] \) and \( [0, m] \), then the generated points will not be valid.
   - For example, if \( n = 4 \), \( m = 3 \), and \( k = 2 \), we might calculate \( g \) such that \( n1 \) or \( m1 \) results in points falling outside the specified limits.
   - Specifically, since there's no explicit check that ensures the generated points are within the required range, it is possible for the program to generate invalid points.

**Counterexample**:
- Consider \( n = 1, m = 1, k = 2\). The expected area would be \( \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\). However, since the area must be an integer, the program would output "NO", which is correct.
- Now, try \( n = 4, m = 2, k = 5\). This will lead to \( nm = 8 \) which isn't divisible by 5, hence output "NO", which is also correct.
- However, for \( n = 3, m = 2, k = 2\), it returns "YES" but it can generate points outside the bounds.

In conclusion, the program does not guarantee that the generated points abide by the \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \) constraints for every possible input configuration. This leads to situations where invalid output points could be produced.

Correctness: **False**
