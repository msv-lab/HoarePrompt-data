To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the code.

The problem states that we need to find three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The program handles the following conditions:

1. It checks if the area is an integer by comparing `area` to `int(area)`.
2. If the area is 0 or not an integer, it prints "NO".
3. It attempts to find three points forming a triangle based on different conditions regarding `n`, `m`, and `area`.

Now, let's evaluate some edge cases and the logic:

- **Case**: If \(n\) and \(m\) are both very small (for example, \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\)). The area would be \( \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5\). The program would output "NO" since the area is not an integer, which is correct.

- **Boundary case**: If \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\), and \(k = 2\), the area computes to \( \frac{2 \times 2}{2} = 2\). The program checks if \(2 * area\) is less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\), which it isn't here because \(2 * 2 = 4\) is greater than both \(n\) and \(m\). It will then default to `print(f'{n} {m // 2}')` and `print(f'0 {m // 2}')`, which does not form a valid triangle. Here, it will print:
```
YES
2 1
0 1
```
This does not satisfy the triangle area condition because the area of the points does not result in the area of 2.

- **General case**: The program defaults to printing specific points without checking if they correspond to the required area for every possible scenario. 

Thus, there are scenarios where the triangle's area condition is not satisfied, leading to incorrect outputs.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly, specifically when the coordinates chosen do not yield the specified area.
