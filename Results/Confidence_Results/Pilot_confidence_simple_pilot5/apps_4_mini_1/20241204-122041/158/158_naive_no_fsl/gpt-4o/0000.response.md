Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to create the compote while adhering to the given ratio of 1:2:4. 

### Explanation of the Code:
1. It takes input for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on:
   - The available lemons (`a`).
   - Half of the number of apples (`b // 2`), since 2 apples are required for each lemon.
   - One-fourth of the number of pears (`c // 4`), since 4 pears are required for each lemon.
3. The maximum feasible number of lemons (`max_lemons`) is determined using the minimum of these three values.
4. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons)
   - `max_lemons * 2` (for apples)
   - `max_lemons * 4` (for pears)
5. The computed total is printed.

### Validation:
- The program accounts for all edge cases, including:
  - If there are insufficient fruits to make any compote (for example, if any fruit count is less than the required ratio).
- The output matches the expected results for provided examples.

Therefore, since the program satisfies all conditions specified in the problem description for all potential cases, it is deemed correct.
