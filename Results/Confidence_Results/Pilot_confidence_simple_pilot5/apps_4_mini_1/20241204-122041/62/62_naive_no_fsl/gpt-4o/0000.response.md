Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in different bases. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of digits and the respective bases for both numbers X and Y.

2. **Conversion Function**: The function `func_1` is used to convert the digits of a number from the specified base to decimal. It correctly computes the decimal value using the formula \( \text{decimal\_value} = \text{decimal\_value} \times \text{base} + \text{digit} \), which is the standard method for base conversion.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as different lengths of digit representations and different bases correctly due to the nature of decimal comparison.

Since there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, it is deemed correct.
