Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if matrix B can be made equal to matrix A using a series of operations that set the values of a 2x2 submatrix to 1. However, the logic used in the program is flawed.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic in Conditionals**: The program checks if the top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix and its surrounding corners (i.e., A[i][j], A[i+1][j], A[i][j+1], A[i+1][j+1]) are all 1. If they are, it continues without adding an operation, which is not correct. It should check whether it can apply the operation to set those positions to 1, but the current logic skips adding an operation even if it's valid to do so.

2. **Handling of Zeros**: The program does not correctly account for scenarios where the presence of zeros in matrix A indicates that certain operations cannot be performed. For example, if A has any 2x2 submatrix of zeros in a location where there are 1s in another part of the matrix that the program intends to set to 1, it will fail to output the correct operations.

3. **Lack of Final Validation**: The program does not validate whether the resulting matrix B matches matrix A after performing the proposed operations. It assumes that the proposed operations will always yield the correct output, but this is not guaranteed.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following matrix A:
```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
In this case, to make B equal to A:
- The program will attempt to apply operations in positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1), but it will miss the fact that (2, 2) should not be set to 1 because A[2][2] is 0. Thus, it might incorrectly suggest operations that lead to an invalid final matrix.

Because of these issues, the program does not accurately solve the problem as described and can produce incorrect results for specific inputs. Therefore, the correctness is marked as **False**.
