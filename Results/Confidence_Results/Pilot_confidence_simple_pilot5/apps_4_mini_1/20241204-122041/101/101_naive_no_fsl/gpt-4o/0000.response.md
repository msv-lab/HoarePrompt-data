Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the issue arises in the logic that determines the validity of the frame.

### Issue:
1. The program checks if the minimum frame dimensions (height and width) are less than 2. However, the problem allows for a frame size of 1, which can occur in cases where the white pixels are adjacent to each other. For example, if the input has two adjacent white pixels at (0, 0) and (0, 1), a valid frame of size 1 should enclose those pixels, which the program currently does not account for.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
2 2
ww
..
```
In this case, there are two white pixels that can be enclosed by a frame of size 1, but the program would return `-1` due to the height and width being less than 2 according to the condition it checks. 

Thus, the program fails to produce a valid frame when it should, leading to incorrect outputs.

This demonstrates that the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential input cases. Hence, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.
