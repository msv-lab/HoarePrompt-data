Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The issue arises from the way it checks for common configurations between Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. Specifically, the condition `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:` is incorrect because it attempts to use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) on sets, which does not achieve the intended comparison of whether there exists a common configuration in both sets.

To illustrate a failing case, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```

In this case, Bessie can reach configurations `'ABXC'` and `'XAB'`, while Elsie can reach `'ACBX'` and `'XAC'`. The program incorrectly approaches the problem by using a bitwise operation, which would not correctly identify whether there is any overlap in the reachable configurations.

Since the program fails to correctly assess the condition for determining if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration, it does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.
