Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the grasshopper can jump over the insect 'T' and then needs to jump back. For instance, consider the input:

```
8 3
G###T###
```

In this case, the grasshopper 'G' at index 0 can jump to index 3 (3 cells away), but cannot reach index 4 (where 'T' is) because it is blocked by obstacles ('#'). 

Similarly, if the grasshopper were able to jump over 'T' but needs to come back to it, the program does not account for such scenarios.

Thus, the logic of only checking from 'G' to 'T' in a straight line without considering backward jumps or attempts to jump back is flawed. The program must account for both possibilities: jumping forward and then possibly needing to jump back if an obstacle is encountered.
