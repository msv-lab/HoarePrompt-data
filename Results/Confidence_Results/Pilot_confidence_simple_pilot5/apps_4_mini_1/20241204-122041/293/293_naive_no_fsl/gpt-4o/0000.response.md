Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to account for the scenario where Amr skips commands due to visiting the same node multiple times. According to the problem description, if Amr skips two consecutive commands, he should go back to the parent of the current node before executing the next command.

In the provided implementation, the logic for moving through the tree correctly calculates the path to the node `n`, but it does not implement the skipping of commands or the backtracking behavior when two consecutive commands are skipped. 

For example, consider the case where `h = 2` and `n = 3`. According to the tree structure:

```
       0
      / \
     1   2
    / \ / \
   3  4 5  6
```

If Amr were to reach node `2` and then try to go to node `1` (a previously visited node), he would skip this command. If he then tries to go to node `3` next (which is also a previously visited node), he would skip this command as well. According to the rules, it should navigate back to the parent (node `0`) before executing the next command, but the program does not implement this logic.

Thus, there could be many cases in larger trees where the skipping of commands and the need to backtrack are not handled, leading to incorrect counting of visited nodes.
