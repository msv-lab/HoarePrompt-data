Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw that could lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Specifically, it does not handle the case where an array has a total sum of zero but individual elements could still be split into valid non-zero subarrays.

For example, consider the input case:
```
5
1 -1 2 3 -5
```
In this case, the total sum of the array is zero, but it can be split into multiple non-zero subarrays:
- One valid split would be `1`, `-1`, `2`, `3`, and `-5`, each of which is not zero.

However, the program will output "NO" in this case, failing to recognize that a valid split is possible. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements in every potential case.
