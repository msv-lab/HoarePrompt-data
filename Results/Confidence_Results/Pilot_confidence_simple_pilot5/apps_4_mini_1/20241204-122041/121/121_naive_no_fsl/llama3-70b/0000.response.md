Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the situation where the total number of nucleotides (including '?') is not divisible by 4. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
??GCT
```
In this case, `n` is 5, and thus it cannot be split into 4 equal parts (as 5 is not divisible by 4). The program will attempt to calculate `avg` as `5 // 4` which equals 1. The counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' will be set to 1. However, since there are not enough slots (total of 5) to fill in 4 types of nucleotides equally, the program will incorrectly conclude that it's possible to fill the '?' and may output a result like "AAGCT", which does not satisfy the requirement of equal counts.

Thus, the program fails to account for cases where the genome length `n` is not divisible by 4, leading to incorrect outputs.
