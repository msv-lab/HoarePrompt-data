Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to compute the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw without a guide while drawing `n` squares. However, it does not correctly implement the problem's logic.

The issue arises with the formula used to compute `segments_needed`. The code calculates `segments_needed` as `2 * (a + b)`, where `a` is the width (or number of squares along the x-axis) and `b` is the height (or number of squares along the y-axis) derived from the number of squares `n`. While this calculation can give reasonable outputs for certain values of `n`, it does not accurately reflect the number of segments that need to be drawn when considering the actual drawing process.

For instance, if we take `n = 5`, the function would compute:
- For `a = 1`: `b = 5`, resulting in `segments_needed = 12`
- For `a = 5`: `b = 1`, resulting in `segments_needed = 12`
- For `a = 2`: `b = 3`, resulting in `segments_needed = 10`
- For `a = 3`: `b = 2`, resulting in `segments_needed = 10`
- And other values.

However, the correct minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw without a guide for `n=5` is actually `8`, as Sofia can arrange the squares in a way that optimizes the number of segments drawn with a ruler.

The program fails for various values of `n`, particularly when `n` is not a perfect square or does not split evenly into factors that reflect proper square arrangement. Therefore, the computation logic is flawed, leading to an incorrect output for at least some cases. 

Hence, since there are potential inputs where the program does not provide the correct output, the overall correctness is deemed **False**.
