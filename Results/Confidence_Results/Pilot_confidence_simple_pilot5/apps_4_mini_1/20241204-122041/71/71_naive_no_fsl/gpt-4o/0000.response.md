Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the resulting number after removing digits does not start with unnecessary leading zeros, except in the case where the result is the number '0'. 

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 102030  k = 2
```
In this case, the expected output is `3`, because you need to remove the digits '1', '3', and '2' to make '00', which is not allowed since '00' should be treated as '0'.

However, the program will incorrectly count the number of digits to remove and may not account for the case where leading zeros should not be allowed unless the result is exactly '0'.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all possible inputs, making it incorrect.
