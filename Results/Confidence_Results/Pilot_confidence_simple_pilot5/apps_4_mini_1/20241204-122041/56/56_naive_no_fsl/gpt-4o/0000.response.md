To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and consider edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.

2. **Immediate Check**: It checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it returns 'No'. This is correct since if the length of the required sequence `k` exceeds the number `n`, it's impossible to express `n` as a sum of `k` integers.

3. **Bit Extraction**: The program extracts the indices of the set bits in the binary representation of `n` (i.e., where `n` has a value of 1 in its binary form) and stores these indices in the list `bits`. This part is correct as it identifies the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`.

4. **Length Checking**: It checks if the length of `bits` exceeds `k`. If it does, it returns 'No', which is valid because if we have more powers of two than the allowed length of the sequence, we cannot form a valid sequence.

5. **Adjusting to Length `k`**: If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the program pops the smallest power and duplicates it, decrementing it by 1 each time until the length of `bits` equals `k`. This step is crucial because it ensures that we fill the sequence while keeping the largest integer as small as possible.

6. **Sorting**: Finally, the program sorts `bits` in descending order to ensure the output is lexicographically largest.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Edge Case for Small `n` and Large `k`**: 
   - Input: `1 3`
     - Expected Output: `No` (it is impossible to sum to 1 with 3 integers).
     - The program returns `No`, which is correct.

2. **Exact Fit for Powers of Two**:
   - Input: `15 4`
     - Expected Output: `Yes` with output `3 2 1 0` (since `2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 15`).
     - The program would return `Yes` and generate such a sequence correctly.

3. **Negative Powers**:
   - Input: `1 2`
     - Expected Output: `Yes` with output `-1 -1` (since `2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1`).
     - The program correctly identifies that it can use negative powers to fit the sequence.

4. **Handling Cases with No Valid Sequence**:
   - Input: `16 2`
     - Expected Output: `No` (as `2^n` values can't be split into two parts to sum to 16).
     - The program checks the available bits and correctly returns `No`.

### Conclusion

The program handles various edge cases properly by accounting for the conditions laid out in the problem description. It considers the necessary checks for the input values, handles the construction of the sequence, and ensures it meets lexicographical requirements.

After reviewing all these points, I did not find a scenario where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
