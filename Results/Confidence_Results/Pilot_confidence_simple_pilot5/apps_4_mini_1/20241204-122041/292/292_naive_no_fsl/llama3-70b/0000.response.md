Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the weight change of Limak and Bob over the years until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. 

Here's how the program operates:

1. It reads the weights of Limak (a) and Bob (b).
2. It initializes a counter for the number of years.
3. It enters a loop that continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.
4. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled, and the year counter is incremented.
5. Once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, it prints the number of years it took.

This implementation correctly follows the problem requirements for all possible input values within the specified range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). The program also handles edge cases such as when Limak's and Bob's weights are equal (e.g., `1 1`), and correctly calculates the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. 

Since I could not find any example where the program fails to meet the specifications, I conclude that it is correct.
