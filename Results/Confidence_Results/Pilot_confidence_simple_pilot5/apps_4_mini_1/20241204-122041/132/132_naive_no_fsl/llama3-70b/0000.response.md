Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program checks if the sum of stones in the piles before and after is the same and sorts both lists to check for equality. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the fact that stones can be taken away by jury members.

Here's a potential case where the program fails:

- Input:
```
5
2 2 2 2 2
1 0 0 0 0
```

In this case, the total number of stones initially is 10, and the total after is 1. Since stones can be taken, the transition from `(2, 2, 2, 2, 2)` to `(1, 0, 0, 0, 0)` is valid because one stone was taken away. However, the program would output "No" because it only checks the sums and whether the sorted lists are equal, missing the fact that stones can be removed.

Therefore, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, it is deemed incorrect.
