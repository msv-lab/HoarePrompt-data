Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the leading zeros matter. The golden system as described does not allow leading zeros, yet the function `func_1` treats them as valid digits. For example, if we input `0001` and `1`, the expected output should be `=` since both represent the same value in the golden system, but the current program will treat `0001` as having a value of approximately 1.618033988^3 while `1` is treated as approximately 1.618033988^0, leading to an incorrect comparison. Thus, the program fails to adhere to the problem description which requires a valid representation in the golden system that avoids leading zeros.
