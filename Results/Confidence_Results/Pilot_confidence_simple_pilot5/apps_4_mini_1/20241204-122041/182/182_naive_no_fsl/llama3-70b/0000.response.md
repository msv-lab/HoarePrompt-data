Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle negative angles correctly in relation to the required output. 

For instance, if the input is -90 degrees, the expected output should be 2 because after one counter-clockwise rotation, we would end up with a deviation of 90 degrees clockwise. Two 90-degree clockwise rotations from there would correct the image to the vertical position (0 degrees). However, if we input -90 into the provided code, it calculates:

1. `x = -90 % 360` results in `x = 270`
2. It then calculates `(270 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` which simplifies to `(359) // 90 % 4` resulting in `3`.

Thus, the function incorrectly outputs `3` instead of the correct `2`.

This shows that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
