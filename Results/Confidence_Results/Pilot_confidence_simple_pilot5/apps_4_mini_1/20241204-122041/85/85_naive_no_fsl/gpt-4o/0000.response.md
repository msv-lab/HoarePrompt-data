Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of the pairs of shovels is flawed.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the input:

```
n = 10
```

According to the problem description, the shovels would cost 1 to 10. The total costs of pairs of shovels must be checked to find those that end with the maximum number of nines.

The valid pairs and their sums for this case are:
- (1, 10) = 11
- (2, 9) = 11
- (3, 8) = 11
- (4, 7) = 11
- (5, 6) = 11

None of these pairs produce a sum that ends with any trailing nines, so the maximum number of nines is 0. However, the program will incorrectly calculate pairs as:

```
max_nines = 0 (since (10 + 1) % 10 != 0)
pairs = (n + 1) * max_nines = (10 + 1) * 0 = 0
```

Thus, it outputs 0 pairs, which is incorrect because there should be 0 pairs with sums ending with nines, and the output should be 0. 

The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum number of trailing nines and how it calculates the pairs based on that. It does not account for the actual valid pairs and their sums properly.

Overall, since the program fails to handle this and potentially other similar cases correctly, the final determination of correctness is **False**.
