To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` and `can_distribute` functions.

### Understanding the Problem:
1. We have `n` plates, `a` pieces of the first cake, and `b` pieces of the second cake.
2. The goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate, ensuring:
   - Each piece is placed on some plate.
   - Each plate has at least one piece.
   - No plate has pieces from both cakes.

### Analyzing the Code:
- The function `func_1` performs a binary search to determine the maximum `x` (minimum pieces per plate) that can be distributed.
- The `can_distribute(x)` function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each of the `n` plates has at least `x` pieces of cake.

### Issues in the Code:
1. The variable `a` and `b` are accessed in the `can_distribute` function, but they are not defined within its scope. This would lead to a `NameError`.
2. While the logic of distributing pieces seems logical, the program fails to handle cases where `n` is greater than the total number of pieces (i.e., `n > a + b`). In such cases, it should return 0 since it's impossible to distribute even one piece to each plate.

### Edge Case:
Let's consider the input:
```
n = 3, a = 1, b = 1
```
In this case, there are 3 plates but only 2 pieces of cake available (1 from the first cake and 1 from the second). The expected output should be `0` since it's impossible to satisfy the condition that each plate has at least one piece. However, the current implementation would incorrectly attempt to maximize `x` and lead to potential incorrect computations.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly where the total number of pieces is less than the number of plates, and also the scope issue with variables in the `can_distribute` function.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
