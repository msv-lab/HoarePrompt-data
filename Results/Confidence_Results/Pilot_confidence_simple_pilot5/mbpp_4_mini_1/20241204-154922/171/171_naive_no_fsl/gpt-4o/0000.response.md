Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd (i.e., if `n % 2` is not equal to 0), and `False` if it is even. 

The provided assertions test the function with the following cases:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct because 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct because 10 is even.

Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and follows the problem description accurately, the program is correct.
