Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to convert degrees to radians. However, it does not handle negative degree values or values greater than 360 degrees. According to the problem description, the function should correctly convert any input of degrees into radians, which includes handling negative degrees (which should yield a negative radian value) and values beyond the conventional circle (360 degrees or more).

For example:
- If we input `-90`, the expected output should be `-1.5707963267948966`. However, the assertion does not test this case.
- If we input `450`, the expected output should be `7.853981633974483`, but again, the assertion does not test this.

Since the program does not account for these potential cases, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect.
