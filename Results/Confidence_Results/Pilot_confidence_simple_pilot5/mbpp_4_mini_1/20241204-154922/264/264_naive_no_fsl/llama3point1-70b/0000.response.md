Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula: radians = degrees × (π / 180). 

This function will work correctly for all input values, including positive degrees, negative degrees, and zero. For example:
- When `deg = 0`, the function returns `0`, which is correct since 0 degrees equals 0 radians.
- When `deg = 90`, it returns `π/2`, which is correct since 90 degrees equals π/2 radians.
- When `deg = -180`, it returns `-π`, which is correct since -180 degrees equals -π radians.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail in terms of converting degrees to radians based on the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements perfectly.
