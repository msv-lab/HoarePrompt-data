Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension that filters the input list `numbers` to include only those elements that are even (i.e., where the number modulo 2 equals zero). 

The assertions provided (tests) check various scenarios:
1. The first test checks a list with both odd and even numbers, and it returns the correct even numbers `[2, 4]`.
2. The second test checks a mix of even and odd numbers, including a zero, and returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which is correct.
3. The third test checks a list of numbers where all but two are odd, returning the correct even numbers `[8, 12]`.

The program should also handle edge cases such as:
- An empty list (which should return an empty list).
- A list with no even numbers (which should also return an empty list).
- A list with negative even numbers (which should still be returned correctly).

Since the logic in the function handles all numbers, including negative and zero, and correctly identifies even numbers, I did not find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all tested and potential cases.
