Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input array contains duplicate elements. For example, the input `(1, 5, 3, 3, 19, 18, 25)` would return a minimum difference of 0, because the two '3's have a difference of 0. However, according to the problem description, the function should find the minimum difference between any two distinct elements, and in this case, the minimum difference between the distinct elements is still 1 (between 3 and 4). 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not account for duplicates and their impact on calculating the minimum difference.
