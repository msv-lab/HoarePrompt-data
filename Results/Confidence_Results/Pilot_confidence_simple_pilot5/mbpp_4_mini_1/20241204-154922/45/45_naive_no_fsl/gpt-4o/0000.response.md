To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to understand the definition of an "undulating" number as implied in the problem description. An undulating number alternates between two digits.

Given the program logic and assertions in the code:

1. The function `func_1(n)` converts the number to a string and checks if its length is less than 3, returning `False` if so.
2. It checks if the first two digits are the same, returning `False` if they are.
3. It then uses a loop to check if the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit.
4. If all checks pass, it returns `True`, indicating the number is undulating.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- The function correctly identifies that numbers like `1212121` and `121` are undulating.
- It correctly identifies that `1991` is not undulating since it has two different digits but does not alternate correctly.

However, we need to check further:

- For the input `111`, the function will return `False` because the first two digits are the same. However, if we consider `111` as undulating (since it only has one digit repeated), it contradicts the function's logic.
- For the input `1221`, the function will return `False`, but this number alternates between two digits, which could be considered undulating in some interpretations.

Therefore, the function fails to recognize `111` as undulating, and it also does not handle the number `1221` correctly as per a broader interpretation of undulating numbers.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases of undulating numbers as outlined above.
