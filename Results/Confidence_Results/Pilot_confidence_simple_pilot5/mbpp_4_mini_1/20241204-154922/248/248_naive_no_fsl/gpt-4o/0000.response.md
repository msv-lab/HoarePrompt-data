Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements in the same order. 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various input cases:

1. For the input list `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]`, the output is `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`.
2. For the input list `[2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]`, the output is `(2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`.
3. For the input list `[58, 44, 56]`, the output is `(58, 44, 56)`.

These examples demonstrate that the function handles typical cases of converting lists of integers to tuples correctly. 

Additionally, the function should work for edge cases, such as:
- An empty list `[]`, which should return an empty tuple `()`.
- A list containing mixed types, such as `[1, "two", 3.0]`, which should return `(1, "two", 3.0)`.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and passes the provided test cases, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases I could think of. Thus, the final assessment is that the program is correct.
