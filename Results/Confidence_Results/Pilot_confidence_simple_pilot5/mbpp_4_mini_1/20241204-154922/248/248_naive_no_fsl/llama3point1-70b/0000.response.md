Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. This function will handle all types of lists, including empty lists and lists containing various data types (e.g., integers, strings, nested lists). For example:

1. An empty list `[]` will convert to an empty tuple `()`.
2. A list like `[1, 2, 3]` will convert to the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`.
3. A list containing mixed types, such as `[1, 'two', 3.0]`, will be converted to `(1, 'two', 3.0)`.

Since there are no edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle according to the problem description, the program is deemed to be correct.
