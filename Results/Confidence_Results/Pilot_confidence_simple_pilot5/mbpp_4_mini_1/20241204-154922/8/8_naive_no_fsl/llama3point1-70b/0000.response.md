To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the implementation and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the provided code for reference:

```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Key Points in the Code:
1. The program finds the first and last occurrences of the specified character in the string.
2. If both occurrences are found, it checks if they are the same (which would mean the character only appears once).
3. It handles the case where the character appears multiple times by slicing the string around the found indices.
4. If the character is not found at all, it returns the string unchanged.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Character appears only once**: The code handles this by using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which correctly removes the character.
2. **Character appears more than once**: The slicing will work as expected to remove the first and last occurrences.
3. **Character does not appear in the string**: The function correctly returns the original string, which is also as expected.
4. **String is empty**: The function will return an empty string, which is consistent with the requirements.
5. **String consists only of the character**: For example, if `s = 'aaa'` and `char = 'a'`, the expected output should be an empty string, which the code handles correctly.

### Potential Case Where the Program Might Fail:
The program works correctly for the described behavior, but let's analyze a specific scenario:

- Input: `s = "abcabc", char = "a"` 
  - Expected Output: `"bcab"` (removing the first "a" at index 0 and the last "a" at index 3).
  - The Code Output: `"bcab"` (correct).

However, one issue arises in the scenario where the character is not found:

- Input: `s = "abcdef", char = "z"` 
  - Expected Output: `"abcdef"` (no changes).
  - Code Output: `"abcdef"` (correct).

All checks seem to be functioning properly without any missed cases, and the program correctly handles various scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases analyzed. 

Correctness: **True**. 

The function accurately removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character across various input conditions.
