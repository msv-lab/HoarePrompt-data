Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the specified problem description. 

The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The implementation in the program adheres to this definition:
1. It correctly returns 2 for `n = 0`.
2. It correctly returns 1 for `n = 1`.
3. For `n > 1`, it uses a loop to calculate the n-th Lucas number by iteratively summing the two preceding numbers in the sequence.

The logic is sound and handles all potential cases for non-negative integers, which is the required input domain for n. Therefore, the program is correct and fulfills the requirement as described in the problem statement.
