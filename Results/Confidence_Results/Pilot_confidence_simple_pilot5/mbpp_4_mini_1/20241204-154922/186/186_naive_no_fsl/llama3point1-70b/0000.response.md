To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the code.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires extracting elementwise tuples from two given tuples. This typically implies that we would perform an operation on corresponding elements from the two tuples.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` uses a generator expression inside a tuple constructor:
```python
return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
Here, it applies the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. 

### Potential Issues:
1. **Assumption of Numeric Tuples**: The program assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` contain numeric elements (integers) because the bitwise AND operation (`&`) is not defined for non-integer types (e.g., strings). If `tup1` contained strings or other non-integer types, the function would raise a TypeError.

2. **Different Length Tuples**: If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple. This means that any extra elements in the longer tuple would be ignored, which may not be the intention of the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle cases where either `tup1` or `tup2` is empty, which could lead to an empty tuple returned, but itâ€™s unclear if this behavior is acceptable based on the problem description.

### Test Cases:
1. If we provide tuples that contain non-integer types, for example:
   ```python
   func_1(('a', 'b'), (1, 2))  # This will raise TypeError.
   ```

2. If the tuples are of different lengths, for example:
   ```python
   func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))  # This will return (0, 0), ignoring the '3' from tup1.
   ```

3. If one of the tuples is empty:
   ```python
   func_1((), (1, 2))  # This will return an empty tuple, which may or may not be correct based on the problem description.
   ```

Given these potential failures in the program, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle non-integer types, different lengths of tuples, and the behavior for empty tuples is ambiguous based on the problem description.
