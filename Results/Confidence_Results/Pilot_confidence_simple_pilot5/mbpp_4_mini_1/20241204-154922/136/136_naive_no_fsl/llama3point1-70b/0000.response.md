Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and uses a dictionary comprehension to filter out entries where the value is less than `n`, returning only those entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. 

I cannot think of any cases where this logic would fail, as it appropriately checks each value against `n` and constructs a new dictionary with only the valid entries. It handles all potential cases, including:

1. An empty dictionary (which would return another empty dictionary).
2. A dictionary where all values are less than `n` (which would also return an empty dictionary).
3. A dictionary where all values are greater than or equal to `n` (which would return the original dictionary).
4. A dictionary with mixed values, correctly filtering based on the comparison.

Thus, the code behaves as expected for all conceivable input scenarios.
