Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a dictionary and an integer `n`, and it returns a new dictionary that includes only the entries from the original dictionary where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that it works correctly for the given test cases:

1. For the input dictionary `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` and `n = 170`, the output is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is correct.
2. For the same dictionary with `n = 180`, the output is `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is also correct.
3. Finally, for `n = 190`, the output is `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which again is correct.

The function utilizes a dictionary comprehension that constructs a new dictionary by iterating over the original dictionary's items and filtering based on the condition `v >= n`. This approach correctly captures all cases where values are equal to or exceed `n`.

Since I cannot find any potential edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
