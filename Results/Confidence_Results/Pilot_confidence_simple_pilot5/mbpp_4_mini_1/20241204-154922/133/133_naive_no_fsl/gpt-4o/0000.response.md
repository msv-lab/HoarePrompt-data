Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the two input tuples have different lengths. According to the problem description, it is expected to subtract the elements at the same index. If one tuple is longer than the other, the program will raise a `ValueError` when trying to zip the tuples together. 

For example:
```python
func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))  # Would raise an error due to different lengths
```
This shows that the function does not behave correctly for all potential cases as required by the problem description. Hence, the function is incorrect.
