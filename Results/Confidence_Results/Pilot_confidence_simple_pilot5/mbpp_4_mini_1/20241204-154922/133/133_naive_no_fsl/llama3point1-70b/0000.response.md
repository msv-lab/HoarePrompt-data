Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the described functionality of subtracting corresponding elements of two tuples. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously, and it performs the subtraction for each pair of elements. The result is then converted back into a tuple, which matches the requirement of returning a tuple of the differences.

Here are a few considerations confirming the correctness:

1. **Handling of Tuples of Different Lengths**: The `zip` function will stop at the shortest tuple, thus preventing index errors and ensuring that it only processes pairs of elements that exist in both tuples. This behavior is appropriate given the nature of the problem, though it does mean that if the tuples are of unequal lengths, the longer tuple's trailing elements will be ignored, which is a reasonable design choice unless otherwise specified.

2. **Element Types**: The subtraction works for numerical types (integers and floats). If both tuples contain numeric values, the operation will be performed correctly.

3. **Empty Tuples**: If both input tuples are empty, the result will also be an empty tuple, which is consistent with what one would expect from subtracting no elements.

4. **Negative Numbers**: The program will correctly handle negative numbers due to the nature of arithmetic subtraction.

Since no edge cases or examples were found that would cause the program to fail in its described functionality, it is determined to be correct.

In summary, after considering various scenarios, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
