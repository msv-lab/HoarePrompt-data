Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It uses a while loop to extract each digit (by taking `n % 10`), adding it to a total sum, and then removing the last digit from `n` (using integer division `n //= 10`) until `n` is reduced to 0.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works correctly for the test cases given (345, 12, and 97). The sum of the digits for each of these numbers is correctly calculated as follows:
- For 345: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
- For 12: 1 + 2 = 3
- For 97: 9 + 7 = 16

Additionally, the function is designed to handle any non-negative integer input. The logic correctly sums the digits of integers including 0, which would return 0 (the sum of the digits of 0).

There are no edge cases or scenarios presented in the problem description that the program does not handle, making it robust for the specified task. Therefore, there are no examples where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct and meets all requirements.
