Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Non-negative Integer Input**: The program assumes that the input `n` is a non-negative integer, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **String Conversion and Iteration**: The program converts the integer `n` to a string, allowing it to iterate over each character in the string representation of the number.

3. **Digit Summation**: For each character (digit) in the string, it converts the character back to an integer and then sums those integers using the `sum()` function. This approach effectively computes the sum of all the digits in the number.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles various edge cases:
   - For input `0`, the output is `0`, which is correct.
   - For a number like `123`, the output is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is also correct.
   - The program can handle any non-negative integer, including large numbers, due to Python's handling of integers.

Since the program correctly computes the sum of the digits for all potential valid inputs as specified in the problem description and there are no identified edge cases where it fails, the program is deemed correct.
