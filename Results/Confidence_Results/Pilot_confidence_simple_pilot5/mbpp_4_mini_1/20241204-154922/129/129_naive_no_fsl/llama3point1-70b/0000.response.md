Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the requirement stated in the problem description that the input must be a single character. If the input is an empty string or a string containing more than one character, the behavior of the function is not specified. 

For example:
- `func_1('')` would raise a `TypeError` because `ord()` expects a single character, and an empty string doesn't provide one.
- `func_1('ab')` would also raise a `TypeError`, as `ord()` cannot handle strings longer than one character.

Since the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, the correctness is deemed false.
