Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function `func_1` that counts the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The `count` method of a tuple is used, which accurately returns the number of times the specified element appears, as demonstrated by the assertions included in the code. 

1. For the first assertion, the element `4` does not exist in the tuple, so the count should indeed be `0`.
2. For the second assertion, the element `10` appears three times in the tuple, which is correctly reflected in the returned count of `3`.
3. For the third assertion, the element `8` appears four times in the tuple, confirmed by the returned count of `4`.

The function handles various cases: it returns `0` for elements absent from the tuple, and counts correctly for elements present in varying frequencies. The method used (`count`) is appropriate for the problem as described.

Since all tested cases work as expected, I cannot find a single case where the program does not work correctly. Thus, the program is considered correct.
