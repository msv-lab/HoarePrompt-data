Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(tup, elem)` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as inputs and uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. 

This approach is valid and works for all potential cases, including:
- Counting occurrences of an element that appears multiple times.
- Counting occurrences of an element that appears once.
- Counting occurrences of an element that does not appear at all (which should return 0).
- Handling tuples with mixed data types.
- Working with empty tuples, which should also return 0.

Since I could not identify any case where the function does not perform as expected based on the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
