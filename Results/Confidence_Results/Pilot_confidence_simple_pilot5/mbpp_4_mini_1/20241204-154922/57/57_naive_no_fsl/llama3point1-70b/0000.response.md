Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive. 

To verify this, consider the following scenarios:

1. **General case with mixed case**:
   - Input: `[["banana", "Apple", "cherry"], ["date", "Fig", "grape"]]`
   - Output: `[['Apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], ['date', 'Fig', 'grape']]`
   - The program sorts 'Apple' before 'banana' and 'cherry', due to case-insensitive sorting.

2. **Empty sublists**:
   - Input: `[[], ["banana", "Apple"]]`
   - Output: `[[], ['Apple', 'banana']]`
   - The program correctly handles empty lists.

3. **All elements are the same**:
   - Input: `[["apple", "apple", "apple"]]`
   - Output: `[['apple', 'apple', 'apple']]`
   - The program does not alter the order of identical elements.

4. **Sublist with single element**:
   - Input: `[["single"]]`
   - Output: `[['single']]`
   - The program correctly returns the single element sublist unchanged.

5. **Sublist with numbers in string format**:
   - Input: `[["1", "10", "2"]]`
   - Output: `[['1', '10', '2']]`
   - Strings with numeric values are sorted by their string representation.

Given these scenarios, the program behaves correctly and handles various edge cases appropriately. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct.
