Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input and correctly performs the following:

1. It checks if the element is present in the array using the `index` method, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found.
2. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element.
3. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` and returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

Essentially, the program handles all potential cases as described:
- If the element is in the array, it returns the correct index.
- If the element is not in the array, it returns `-1`.

Since it functions correctly for all valid inputs and adheres to the problem description without missing any edge cases, the correctness of the program is validated.
