Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples and correctly computes the average of corresponding values from each tuple. The logic implemented in the function iterates through each index of the inner tuples, collects the values at that index from all tuples, computes their average, and appends it to the results list.

To verify the correctness:

1. For each index `i`, the function constructs a list `elements_at_position` that contains all the `i`-th elements from the inner tuples.
2. It calculates the average by summing these elements and dividing by the number of tuples.
3. This process is repeated for every index, and the averages are collected into a list which is then returned.

The provided assert statements in the program test various cases, including:
- Cases with positive values.
- A case with negative values and a zero.
- A case with larger numbers and varying positions.

The code correctly handles all these scenarios. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would return an incorrect result based on the given problem description.

Thus, since the function behaves as expected for all tested inputs, the correctness of the program is confirmed as true.
