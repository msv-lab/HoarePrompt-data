To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how the `func_1` function computes the angle of a complex number and verify if it aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that computes the angle (or phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary components.

### Program Overview:
The program defines a function `func_1(real, imag)` that:
1. Takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
2. Creates a complex number using `complex(real, imag)`.
3. Returns the phase of the complex number using `cmath.phase(complex_number)`.

The program also includes assertions to test the function with specific complex numbers.

### Assertions:
1. `func_1(0, 1j)` should return approximately \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) (or 1.5707963267948966).
2. `func_1(2, 1j)` should return approximately \( \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \) (or 0.4636476090008061).
3. `func_1(0, 2j)` should return approximately \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) (or 1.5707963267948966).

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Complex Number with Zero Real Part**: The function handles cases where the real part is zero correctly (e.g., inputs like `0 + yi`).
2. **Complex Number with Zero Imaginary Part**: What happens if we input a purely real number (e.g., `func_1(1, 0)`)? The expected output should be 0.
3. **Complex Number with Negative Values**: We should also consider negative inputs, like `func_1(-1, 1)`, which should return \( \frac{3\pi}{4} \) or approximately 2.356194490192345.

### Testing Edge Cases:

Let's consider `func_1(1, 0)`:
- This should return 0, but the current implementation does not test this case. 

Letâ€™s also consider `func_1(-1, 1)`:
- This should return approximately 2.356194490192345.

### Verdict:
Since the assertions in the code do not test the cases where the real part is zero and the imaginary part is zero, or other negative values, the program does not cover all edge cases needed to assert its correctness fully.

Correctness: **False**  
The program does not handle cases such as `func_1(1, 0)` correctly, as there are no assertions for it, and thus it can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.
