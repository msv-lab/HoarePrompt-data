Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the input array is empty. If an empty array is passed to the function `func_1`, it will raise a `ValueError` when trying to compute `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` because these functions cannot operate on an empty sequence. 

For example:
```python
print(func_1([]))  # This will raise ValueError
```

Since the program does not handle this edge case, it is considered incorrect according to the problem description.
