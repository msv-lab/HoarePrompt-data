Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the list contains only one unique number correctly. The problem description requires finding the second smallest number in a list, but the program returns `None` when there are not at least two unique numbers in the list. This behavior is correct; however, it fails to explicitly mention what should happen in such cases according to the requirements. 

Here is a potential case where the program fails:
- For the input `[3]`, the expected output should be `None` (since there is no second smallest number), and the program handles that correctly. However, for an input like `[2, 2]`, the program also returns `None`, which might be acceptable but is somewhat ambiguous without clear specifications on how duplicates should be handled.

Moreover, if the program were to be tested with a wider range of scenarios, it should also correctly handle negative numbers, mixed numbers, and various data types, which it does, but the clarity on the return value when duplicates exist is not comprehensive.

However, the overall implementation seems fine, but due to the ambiguity and lack of clarity in the specified requirements regarding duplicates and single unique numbers, the program could lead to confusion. Hence, based on potential ambiguities and the strict adherence to the specification, the conclusion is that it is not correctly implemented for all edge cases.

Thus, the correctness of the program is marked as **False**.
