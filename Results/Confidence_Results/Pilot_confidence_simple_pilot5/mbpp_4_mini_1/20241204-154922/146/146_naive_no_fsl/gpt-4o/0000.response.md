To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1` in the context of the problem description, which states that the function should return the length and the contents of the longest list from a list of lists.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. **Loop through each list**: It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`.
3. **Update logic**: For each list, if its length is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current list.
4. **Return statement**: Finally, it returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the corresponding list.

### Test Cases in the Code:
The code includes three assertions:
- For `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, it correctly identifies `[13, 15, 17]` as the longest list with a length of 3.
- For `[[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]`, it correctly returns `[10, 12, 14, 15]` with a length of 4.
- For `[[5], [15, 20, 25]]`, it returns `[15, 20, 25]` with a length of 3.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty list of lists**: If `list_of_lists` is empty (`[]`), the function should ideally return `(0, [])` since there are no lists to evaluate. However, the current implementation would return `(0, [])`, which is correct in terms of returning the longest list but might not be explicitly tested.
   
2. **Multiple longest lists**: If there are multiple lists of the same maximum length, the function currently returns the first one it encounters. For example:
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` should return `(2, [1, 2])`, but if exactly two lists of maximum length exist, the function does not guarantee which one it will return.

3. **Lists with varying types**: The function does not handle cases where lists contain different types of elements (like strings or mixed types), but since the problem description doesn't specify the type of elements, this issue might not be relevant.

### Conclusion:
The implementation works correctly for the provided test cases but does not handle the empty list of lists and multiple lists of the same maximum length thoroughly according to a strict interpretation of "the list of maximum length." 

Thus, the program may not behave as expected for these edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
