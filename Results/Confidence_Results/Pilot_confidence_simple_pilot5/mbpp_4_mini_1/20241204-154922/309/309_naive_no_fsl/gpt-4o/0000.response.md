Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string is empty (`''`). According to the problem description, it doesn't specify how to handle empty strings, but the current implementation returns `True` for empty strings. An empty string does not have characters, so it could be argued that not all characters are the same. 

Thus, an example case where the program does not work as expected is when `s = ''`. The expected behavior, assuming consistency with the wording of the problem description, would be to return `False`, but the program returns `True`. This inconsistency leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
