To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. The function `func_1(n)` initializes an index `idx` starting at 1.
2. It enters an infinite loop where it computes the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. It checks the length of the string representation of this triangular number. If the length is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns the current index `idx`.
4. If the condition is not met, it increments the index and continues looping.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with **exactly** `n` digits.

### Potential Issue:
The provided code checks for triangular numbers with at least `n` digits (the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`). This does not guarantee that it finds the index of the smallest triangular number with **exactly** `n` digits. 

For example:
- If `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with exactly 3 digits is 105 (the 14th triangular number). However, the 13th triangular number is 91, which has only 2 digits, and the 14th has 3 digits. The code would return 14 because it finds a triangular number with at least 3 digits, which is correct, but it does not handle cases where we need to ensure we are looking for "exactly" 3 digits.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly implement the requirement of finding the smallest triangular number with **exactly** `n` digits. 

Correctness: **False** 

It does not work correctly for cases where finding "exactly" `n` digits is required, as it can return an index where the triangular number has more than `n` digits.
