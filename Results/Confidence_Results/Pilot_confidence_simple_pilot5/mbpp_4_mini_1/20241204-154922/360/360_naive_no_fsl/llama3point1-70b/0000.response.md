Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of returning the list from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` efficiently finds the list with the maximum sum by leveraging the built-in `max` function and the `sum` function as the key for comparison. Here are a few considerations that confirm its correctness:

1. If the input `lists` is empty, the program will raise a ValueError due to the max function being unable to operate on an empty sequence. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle empty inputs; thus, this behavior might be acceptable or deemed outside the scope of the problem.

2. For any non-empty list of lists, the function will return the inner list with the highest sum accurately.

3. It correctly handles cases where two or more inner lists have the same maximum sum by returning the first occurrence due to the behavior of `max`.

Considering these points, if the input is valid (non-empty list of lists), the function performs correctly as per the problem description.
