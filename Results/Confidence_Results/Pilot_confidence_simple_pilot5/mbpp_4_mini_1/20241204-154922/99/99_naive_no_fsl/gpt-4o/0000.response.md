Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from the input string `s` that have odd index values. The provided assertions check various strings and confirm that the function outputs the expected results by retaining only the characters at even indices (index 0, 2, 4, ...).

To illustrate:

1. For the input `'abcdef'`, the even indexed characters are `'a'` (index 0), `'c'` (index 2), and `'e'` (index 4), resulting in the output `'ace'`.
2. For the input `'python'`, the even indexed characters are `'p'` (index 0), `'t'` (index 2), and `'o'` (index 4), resulting in the output `'pto'`.
3. For the input `'data'`, the even indexed characters are `'d'` (index 0) and `'t'` (index 2), resulting in the output `'dt'`.
4. For the input `'lambs'`, the even indexed characters are `'l'` (index 0), `'m'` (index 2), and `'s'` (index 4), resulting in the output `'lms'`.

The program properly handles strings of various lengths, including even and odd lengths. Since all tested inputs yield the correct outputs as per the problem description, the function meets the requirements without missing any edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.
