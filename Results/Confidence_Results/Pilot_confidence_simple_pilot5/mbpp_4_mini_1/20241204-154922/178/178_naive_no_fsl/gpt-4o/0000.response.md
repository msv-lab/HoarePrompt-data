To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description and the provided implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to round every number in a given list and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

**Program Overview:**
The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number, computes the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the list.

**Code Analysis:**
1. The rounding is performed correctly using the `round()` function.
2. The total sum of the rounded numbers is calculated using `sum()`.
3. The result is calculated by multiplying the total sum by `len(numbers)`.

**Test Cases Provided:**
1. `func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5])` returns `243`
2. `func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29])` returns `345`
3. `func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2])` returns `513`

**Checking Further Cases:**
We need to ensure there aren't any edge cases or scenarios where the implementation fails. 

- If we test with an empty list `func_1([])`, this would raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `len(numbers)` would be `0`, leading to multiplication by zero not resulting in a defined output.

- If the list contains negative rounded values, they will also contribute negatively to the sum, which might not align with expected behavior depending on the context of the problem.

For example:
- `func_1([-0.5, -1.5])` would round to `0` and `-2`, sum to `-2`, and multiply by `2` giving `-4`, which might not be consistent with intended behavior if the problem expects only positive sums.

**Conclusion:**
Since there are cases where the function does not handle an empty list properly and potentially may not align outputs for negative numbers as expected, we conclude that the function is not correct as it fails to handle certain edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
