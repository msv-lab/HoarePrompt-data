The provided program attempts to sort a list of elements using a flipping method, similar to pancake sorting. However, it has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly.

1. **Scope Issue**: The function `find_max_index(n)` references `arr`, but `arr` is not defined within its scope. This will result in a NameError when the function is called.

2. **Flipping Logic**: The logic inside the `flip()` function is attempting to swap the elements of an array, but it does not receive the array as an argument, which means it can't manipulate the correct list.

3. **Returning the Result**: The `func_1` function is supposed to sort the array and return it, but due to the aforementioned issues, it won't actually sort anything.

Given these points, it's clear that there is at least one case (any input list) where the program will fail.

Correctness: **False** 

The code does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm due to scope issues and incorrect handling of the input array. For example, calling `func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69])` would lead to a NameError because `arr` is not defined within `find_max_index`.
