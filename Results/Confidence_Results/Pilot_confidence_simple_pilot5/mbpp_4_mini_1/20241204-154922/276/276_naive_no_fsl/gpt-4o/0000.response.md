To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and check if it accurately finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

The function combines the two input lists into one sorted list and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the combined list is even or odd.

Upon close inspection, the following points can be noted:

1. **Input Assumption**: The function assumes that both lists are of the same size, as stated in the problem description. However, the function does not include any checks to enforce this constraint. If lists of different sizes were provided, it would still proceed to calculate the median incorrectly.

2. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases where one or both lists are empty or where the lists contain negative numbers or duplicates. While the provided test cases assume valid inputs, the function should handle various scenarios gracefully.

3. **Test Coverage**: The assertions provided in the code do cover some basic cases, but they do not test scenarios where the lists are of different sizes or where they might contain edge-case values.

A specific case that demonstrates the potential failure of the program is:
- When both lists are empty, the function will attempt to access indices that do not exist, leading to an error.

Considering these points, the function does not satisfy the requirement of always correctly determining the median for all potential cases, particularly because of the lack of input validation for the list sizes.

Correctness: **False**
