To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to return the maximum value from the `n`th column of a given matrix (a list of lists).

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Analysis
1. **Zero-Indexing:** Python uses zero-based indexing. The function receives `n` as a 1-based index (from the problem description), so it correctly translates it to a 0-based index using `n - 1`.

2. **Assumption of Column Existence:** The function does not check whether `n - 1` is a valid index for the rows in the matrix. If any row has fewer than `n` elements, this will lead to an `IndexError`.

3. **Empty Matrix Handling:** If the matrix is empty (i.e., `matrix = []`), calling `max()` on an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`.

4. **Uniform Row Length Assumption:** The function assumes all rows in the matrix have the same number of columns. If the rows have varying lengths, the program could fail for rows that do not have `n` columns.

### Counterexamples
- **Example 1:** An empty matrix
    ```python
    func_1([], 1)
    ```
    This would raise a `ValueError`.

- **Example 2:** A matrix with rows of different lengths
    ```python
    func_1([[1, 2], [3]], 2)
    ```
    This would raise an `IndexError` because the second row does not have a second column.

- **Example 3:** A valid input but out-of-bound column
    ```python
    func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 3)
    ```
    This will also raise an `IndexError` since the column index `2` (1-based) does not exist in the rows.

### Conclusion
The function fails to handle several potential edge cases, such as empty matrices, rows of differing lengths, and out-of-bounds column indices. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description under all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
