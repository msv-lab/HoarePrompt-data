To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description, which states that the function should return the maximum value in the specified n-th column of a given matrix.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The function `func_1(matrix, n)` takes a matrix (list of lists) and an integer `n`.
2. It extracts the n-th column from the matrix using a list comprehension: `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`.
3. It returns the maximum value from the extracted column using `return max(nth_column)`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases that could break this function:

1. **Index Out of Range**: If `n` is larger than the number of columns in any of the rows of the matrix, it will raise an `IndexError`. For instance:
   - `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2)` will raise an error because there is no second index (index 2) in the rows.

2. **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix is empty, calling the function will also lead to issues:
   - `func_1([], 0)` would raise an `IndexError` because there would be no rows to access.

3. **Columns of Unequal Length**: If the rows of the matrix have different lengths, and `n` is valid for some rows but not others, it will still raise an `IndexError`:
   - `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]], 2)` will work for the second row but not for the first row.

The provided test cases do not cover these edge cases. The assertions only check for valid inputs where `n` is within bounds.

Therefore, given these considerations, the program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
