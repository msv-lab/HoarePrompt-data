Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array using a modified binary search. 

Hereâ€™s how the code works:
1. It initializes `low` and `high` pointers to represent the current search range in the array.
2. It uses a loop to repeatedly narrow down the search range until the target is found or the range is exhausted.
3. When it finds the target, instead of returning immediately, it updates `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (`high = mid - 1`) to ensure it finds the first occurrence.
4. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`, which is a correct indication that the target does not exist in the array.

The provided assertions check various scenarios, including:
- When the target appears multiple times in the array.
- When the target appears at the beginning or end of the array.
- When the target is not present at all.

All these scenarios are handled correctly, and the function will return the expected results. I can think of no cases where the function would fail to meet the problem requirements based on the provided description. Therefore, the implementation is correct for all potential cases.
