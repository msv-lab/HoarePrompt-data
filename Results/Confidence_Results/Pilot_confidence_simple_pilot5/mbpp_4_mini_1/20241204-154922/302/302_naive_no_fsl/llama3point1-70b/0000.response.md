Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The for loop iterates through each element of the array, and when it finds the element that matches the given number (`num`), it returns the index `i`. If the number is not found in the array, it correctly returns `-1`.

Since the function is designed to work with a sorted array, and it returns the first occurrence of the number as specified in the problem description, I can confirm that it behaves as expected for the following cases:

1. If the array contains multiple occurrences of `num`, it will return the index of the first occurrence.
2. If the array does not contain `num`, it will return `-1`.
3. It handles arrays of various lengths, including an empty array.

No edge cases were identified where the function would fail to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the implementation is correct for all potential cases.
