Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the following one, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding such an instance, it returns `True`, meaning the list is sorted.

Let's analyze the provided assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True` because the list is in ascending order.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False` because `20` is followed by `17`, which is a decrease.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False` because `15` is followed by `14`, also indicating a decrease.

The function correctly identifies sorted and unsorted lists based on the provided assertions. I can't think of a case where it would fail given that it follows the logic of comparing each pair of adjacent elements. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Thus, the program is correct.
