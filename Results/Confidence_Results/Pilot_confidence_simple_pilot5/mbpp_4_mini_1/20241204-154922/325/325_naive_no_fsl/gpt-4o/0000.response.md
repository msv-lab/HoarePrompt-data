Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error. According to the problem description, the program should determine whether a given month number contains 30 days. However, the implementation only checks if the month number is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`, which correctly identifies months with 30 days. 

However, the assertions in the program contain incorrect expected values for certain months:
- `func_1(12) == False` is incorrect because December (month 12) has 31 days, so the correct return value should be `False`.
- `func_1(2) == False` is also incorrect, as February (month 2) has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year; thus, it should return `False` as it does not have 30 days.

Since the assertions are not aligned with the correct logic, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
