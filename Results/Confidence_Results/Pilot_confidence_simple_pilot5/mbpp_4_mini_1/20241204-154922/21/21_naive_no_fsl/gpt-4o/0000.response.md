Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The test cases specified in the assertions demonstrate that the function works as expected for various inputs, including a mix of different numbers. 

Additionally, the program handles typical cases well. There are no edge cases accounted for, such as an empty list, but since the problem description does not specify handling for such cases, it's assumed that the input will always be valid as per the description. If we were to consider edge cases like an empty list or non-numeric inputs, the program might fail, but based on the provided requirements, it appears to be functioning correctly.

Thus, since we cannot find an example where the program does not work as expected given the constraints, the program is deemed correct.
