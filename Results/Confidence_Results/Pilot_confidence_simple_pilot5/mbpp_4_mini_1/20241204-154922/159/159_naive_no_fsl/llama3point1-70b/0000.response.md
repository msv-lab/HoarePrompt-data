Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. 

The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and applies the formula accurately. It uses `math.pi` for an accurate value of Ï€, making it suitable for various inputs, including non-integer values. 

The function will correctly return a positive volume for positive input values of radius and height, and it will return zero for cases where either the radius or height is zero, which is consistent with the geometric definition of the volume of a cone. 

I cannot identify any edge cases or examples where the code would not work as expected based on the problem description. Thus, I conclude that the code is correct.
