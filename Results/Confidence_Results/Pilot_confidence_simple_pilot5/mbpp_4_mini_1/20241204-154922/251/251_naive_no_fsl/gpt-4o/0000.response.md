Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸) based on the mathematical definitions. 

1. The radius \( r \) is computed using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which accurately represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).
2. The angle \( \theta \) is calculated using \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \), which correctly accounts for the signs of x and y to determine the correct quadrant for the angle.

The provided assertions verify the correctness of the function for specific test cases, and all these test cases produce the expected results. 

Since I cannot identify any edge cases or inputs where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct for all valid input values.
