Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). 

1. The variable `r` is calculated using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which correctly computes the radius (distance from the origin) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
2. The variable `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). This function correctly handles the quadrants of the Cartesian plane and accounts for cases where x is zero, preventing division by zero errors.

The program handles all potential edge cases:
- When both x and y are zero, it returns (0, undefined angle), which is appropriate for the polar coordinate system (though mathematically angle can be considered as 0).
- For positive and negative values of x and y, it correctly calculates the angle based on the coordinates' position in the Cartesian plane.

Thus, upon evaluating the code, it meets the requirements of converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates correctly.
