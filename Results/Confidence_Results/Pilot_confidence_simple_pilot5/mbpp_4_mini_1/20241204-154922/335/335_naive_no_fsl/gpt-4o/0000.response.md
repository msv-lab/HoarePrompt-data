To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, we will analyze the implementation of the function `func_1`.

The problem description requires a function that:

1. Finds the occurrence and position of substrings within a string.
2. Returns `None` if there is no match.

The provided program aims to achieve this with the following logic:

- It uses `find()` to locate the starting position of `sub_string` within `main_string`.
- If `find()` returns `-1`, it returns `None`.
- Otherwise, it calculates the ending position of the substring and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position.

Now, let's evaluate the assertions provided:

1. **First assertion**: 
   - Input: `'python programming, python language', 'python'`
   - Result: Expected `('python', 0, 6)`, Actual: `('python', 0, 6)`
   - This passes.

2. **Second assertion**:
   - Input: `'python programming,programming language', 'programming'`
   - Result: Expected `('programming', 7, 18)`, Actual: `('programming', 7, 18)`
   - This passes.

3. **Third assertion**:
   - Input: `'python programming,programming language', 'language'`
   - Result: Expected `('language', 31, 39)`, Actual: `('language', 31, 39)`
   - This passes.

4. **Fourth assertion**:
   - Input: `'c++ programming, c++ language', 'python'`
   - Result: Expected `None`, Actual: `None`
   - This passes.

Now let's consider edge cases and potential issues:

- The function currently only finds the first occurrence of the substring. If multiple occurrences exist and the expectation was to find all of them, this implementation falls short.
  
  For example:
  ```python
  result = func_1('hello hello', 'hello')
  # Expected output could be a list of occurrences, e.g., [('hello', 0, 5), ('hello', 6, 11)]
  # Actual output: ('hello', 0, 5) which does not meet the potential extended requirement.
  ```

- The program does not handle overlapping substrings. If there were a case like `result = func_1('ababab', 'aba')`, the expected behavior might be to return `('aba', 0, 3)` or `('aba', 2, 5)` for the first match found, but it would only return the first occurrence.

Given these evaluations, the function does not fulfill the broader potential requirements of finding all occurrences or handling overlapping substrings as implied by a more general interpretation of "finding occurrences."

Correctness: **False**
