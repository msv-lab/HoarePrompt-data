Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function iterates over the string, selecting characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and concatenates them into a new string. All the test cases provided (`'abcdef'`, `'python'`, `'data'`, `'lambs'`) pass the assertion checks, and the function behaves as expected in each case. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description.
