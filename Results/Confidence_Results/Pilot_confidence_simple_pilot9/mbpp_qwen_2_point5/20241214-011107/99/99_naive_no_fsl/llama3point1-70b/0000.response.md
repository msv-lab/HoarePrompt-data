Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string. It uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string, selecting only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This approach ensures that all characters with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are excluded, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Since there are no potential cases where this function fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
