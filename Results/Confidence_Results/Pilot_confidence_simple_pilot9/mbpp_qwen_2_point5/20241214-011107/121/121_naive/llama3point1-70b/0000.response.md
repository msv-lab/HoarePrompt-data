Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The function `func_2` checks if a number is prime using a basic primality test but does not specifically generate Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. According to the definition, Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are a specific sequence of primes that satisfy certain properties. The program does not implement these specific properties. For instance, the sequence starts with 7, and the next number is 43, which can be generated using the formula \( P(n) = 2^{2^n} + 1 \). The provided code does not follow this sequence generation logic. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes for any input `n`.
