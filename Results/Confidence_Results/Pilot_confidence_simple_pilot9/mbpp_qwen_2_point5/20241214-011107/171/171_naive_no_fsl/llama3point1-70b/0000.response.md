Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns `True` if the given number `n` is odd, which is correct. However, the problem description asks for finding whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function correctly identifies odd numbers but fails to identify even numbers. For even numbers, it should return `False`, but it does not do so. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement for every potential case. For example, if `n = 2`, the function should return `False`, but it returns `True`.
