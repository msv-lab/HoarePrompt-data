Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this with a few examples:

1. For `n = 3431`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 1 appears 1 time (≤ 1)
   - 3 appears 2 times (≤ 3)
   - 4 appears 1 time (≤ 4)
   - 3 appears 2 times (≤ 3)

2. For `n = 987654321`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 1 appears 1 time (≤ 1)
   - 2 appears 1 time (≤ 2)
   - 3 appears 1 time (≤ 3)
   - 4 appears 1 time (≤ 4)
   - 5 appears 1 time (≤ 5)
   - 6 appears 1 time (≤ 6)
   - 7 appears 1 time (≤ 7)
   - 8 appears 1 time (≤ 8)
   - 9 appears 1 time (≤ 9)

3. For `n = 232`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 2 appears 2 times (≤ 2)
   - 3 appears 1 time (≤ 3)

4. For `n = 0`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 0 appears 1 time (≤ 0) - This is valid as 0 ≤ 0.

In all these cases, the function returns `True`. Additionally, the function handles edge cases like leading zeros and single-digit numbers correctly. Therefore, the function works as expected for all potential cases.
