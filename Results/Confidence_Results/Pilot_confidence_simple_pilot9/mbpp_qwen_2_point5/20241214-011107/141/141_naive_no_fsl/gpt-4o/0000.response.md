Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this by considering different cases:

1. For `n = 1234`:
   - The digit frequencies are {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}.
   - All frequencies (1, 1, 1, 1) are less than or equal to their respective digits.
   - The function returns `True`, which is correct.

2. For `n = 51241`:
   - The digit frequencies are {1: 2, 2: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}.
   - The frequency of digit '5' is 1, which is less than or equal to 5.
   - However, the frequency of digit '1' is 2, which is greater than 1.
   - The function returns `False`, which is correct.

3. For `n = 321`:
   - The digit frequencies are {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}.
   - All frequencies (1, 1, 1) are less than or equal to their respective digits.
   - The function returns `True`, which is correct.

The function handles these cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or examples that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct.
