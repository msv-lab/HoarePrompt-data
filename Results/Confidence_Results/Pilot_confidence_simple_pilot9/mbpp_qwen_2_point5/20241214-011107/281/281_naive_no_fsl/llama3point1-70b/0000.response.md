Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The program handles all potential cases where the input list can contain any combination of integers, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. The list comprehension used in the function iterates through each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This logic works for all possible integer inputs, making the program correct according to the given problem description.
