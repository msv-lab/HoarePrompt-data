Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function passes three assertions with different sets of inputs, indicating that it works correctly for those specific cases. Given the general nature of the formula and the consistent results from the assertions, there is no apparent flaw in the logic that would make the function incorrect for other potential cases as well. Therefore, based on the provided information, the function appears to be correct.
