Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates over the given sorted array `arr` in reverse order and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach is correct for finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Since the array is sorted, checking from the end ensures that the first match found is the last occurrence of the target. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the input is a list and the elements are comparable.
