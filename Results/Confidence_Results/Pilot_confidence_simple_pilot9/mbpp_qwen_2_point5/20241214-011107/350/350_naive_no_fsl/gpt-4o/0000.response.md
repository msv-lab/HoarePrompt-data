Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, starting from the last index, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element it encounters. This approach ensures that the last position of the element is found efficiently. 

Given the test cases:
1. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0`: The function correctly returns 0, as 1 is at index 0.
2. `assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2`: The function correctly returns 2, as the last 1 is at index 2.
3. `assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3`: The function correctly returns 3, as the last 3 is at index 3.

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the reverse iteration guarantees finding the last occurrence of the target element, the program is correct. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would make this function fail based on the provided examples and logic.
