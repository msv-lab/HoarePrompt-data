Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input and merges them into a single list which is then sorted using Python's built-in `sorted` function. This approach works correctly for merging and sorting the lists in every case. There are no edge cases or special scenarios where this function would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
