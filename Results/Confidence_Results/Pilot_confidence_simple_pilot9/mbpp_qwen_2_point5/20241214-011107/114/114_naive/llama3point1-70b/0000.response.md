Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. This method works for all elements that are hashable, which includes integers, strings, and other immutable data types. Since the problem description does not impose any restrictions on the type of elements in the tuple, and the function behaves as expected for all such elements, the function is correct.
