Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not meet the problem description because it does not handle the case where the tuple is empty. If an empty tuple is passed to the function along with an element, the function will still return 0, which is technically correct but may not be expected behavior if the function's purpose is to count occurrences in non-empty tuples. However, since the problem description does not explicitly state how the function should behave with an empty tuple, we cannot definitively say the function is incorrect based solely on this. 

But more importantly, the function does not accept the input parameters as described in the problem statement. The problem description mentions that the function should take a tuple and an element as inputs, but the test cases are written in a way that suggests the function might also accept a second argument (the element) in a different context, which is not clearly defined in the provided code. 

Given these observations, if we consider the strictest interpretation of the problem description, the function is incorrect because it does not account for an empty tuple input scenario, and the provided test cases do not cover all potential edge cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
