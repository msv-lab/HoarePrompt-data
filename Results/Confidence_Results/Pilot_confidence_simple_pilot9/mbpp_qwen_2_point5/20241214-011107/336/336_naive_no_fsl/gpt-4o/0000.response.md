Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided in the code cover various scenarios:
1. The first assertion tests a list where all elements at odd indices are odd: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`.
2. The second assertion tests a list where only the first element at an odd index (which is the second element) is even: `[4, 1, 2]`.
3. The third assertion tests a list where the first element at an odd index (which is the second element) is odd: `[1, 2, 3]`.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Since no counterexample was found where the function does not meet the requirements, the function is considered correct.
