Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator `&` between elements of the tuples, which is not the intended operation for extracting elements from the tuples as described in the problem statement. The problem description asks to extract elements from the given two tuples, but the program performs a bitwise AND operation instead. For example, consider the tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`. The expected output would be `(1, 2, 3)` since we are supposed to extract the elements directly, not perform a bitwise AND. However, the program will return `(0, 0, 0)` because `1 & 4 = 0`, `2 & 5 = 0`, and `3 & 6 = 0`.

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x for x in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This version simply returns the tuples without performing any operations on their elements.
