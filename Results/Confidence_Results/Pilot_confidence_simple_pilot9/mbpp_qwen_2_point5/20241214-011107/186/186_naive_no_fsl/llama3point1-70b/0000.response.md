Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function uses the bitwise AND operator `&` between elements of the two tuples, which is not the intended operation for extracting element-wise values. According to the problem description, the goal is to extract the corresponding elements from the two tuples, not to perform a bitwise AND operation. 

For example, consider the input tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`. The expected output should be `(1, 2, 3)`, but the current implementation will return `(0, 0, 0)` because `1 & 4 = 0`, `2 & 5 = 0`, and `3 & 6 = 0`.

To fix this, the function should simply return the elements of `tup1` directly:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This would correctly extract the element-wise pairs from the two tuples.
