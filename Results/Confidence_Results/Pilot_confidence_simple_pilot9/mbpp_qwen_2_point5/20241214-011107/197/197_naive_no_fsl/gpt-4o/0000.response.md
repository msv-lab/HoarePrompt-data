Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list within the given tuple. The function iterates over each element in the list and sums up their counts in the tuple using the `count` method. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. The first test case checks if the function works with repeated elements in both the tuple and the list.
2. The second test case checks if the function works with multiple distinct elements in the list.
3. The third test case checks if the function works with a combination of distinct and non-present elements in the list.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic appears sound for counting occurrences, the function should work for any similar input. Therefore, the program is correct.
