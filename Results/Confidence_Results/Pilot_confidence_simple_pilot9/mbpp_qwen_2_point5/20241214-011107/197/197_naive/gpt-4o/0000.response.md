Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case when the tuple contains duplicate elements and the elements list contains duplicates. For instance, consider the following input:

```
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1), [1, 1]) == 4
```

In this case, the function will count the occurrences of each element in the elements list separately, leading to incorrect results. The function should count each occurrence of an element in the tuple only once for each unique element in the elements list. However, the current implementation will count multiple occurrences of the same element in the tuple for each occurrence in the elements list, resulting in an incorrect count.
