Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and the converted list form of `input_tuple`. This implementation adheres to the problem description for all potential cases. Since tuples can contain elements of any type, converting the tuple to a list and appending it to another list will always yield the correct result as per the requirement. There are no edge cases or special scenarios where this function would fail based on the given problem description.
