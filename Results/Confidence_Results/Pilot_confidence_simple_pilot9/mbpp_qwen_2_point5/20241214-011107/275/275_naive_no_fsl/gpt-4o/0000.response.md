Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. The function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum subset size ending at each index. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: It handles the empty list case by returning 0.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list to facilitate the divisibility check.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i`. For each element, it checks all previous elements to see if they divide the current element, updating the `dp` array accordingly.

Given the provided test cases:
- `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]` results in a subset size of 4 (`[1, 3, 6, 18]`).
- `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]` results in a subset size of 3 (`[5, 10, 20]`).
- `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]` results in a subset size of 4 (`[1, 3, 6, 18]`).

These examples suggest that the function works as intended. Additionally, considering other potential edge cases like lists with duplicate values, negative numbers, or very large numbers, the function still adheres to the logic without requiring any additional changes. Therefore, the function is correct based on the problem description.
