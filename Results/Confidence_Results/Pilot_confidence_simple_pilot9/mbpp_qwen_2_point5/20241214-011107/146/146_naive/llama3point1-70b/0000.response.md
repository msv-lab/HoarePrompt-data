Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not return a list of all sublists with the maximum length. Instead, it only returns the first sublist with the maximum length. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]`, the expected output should be `([3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8])`, but the program will only return `([6, 7, 8])`. This behavior does not meet the problem description which requires returning a list of all sublists with the maximum length.
