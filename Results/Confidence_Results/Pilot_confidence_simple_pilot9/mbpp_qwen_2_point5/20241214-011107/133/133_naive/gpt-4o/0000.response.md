Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of two tuples. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction for each pair of elements from the input tuples. This approach ensures that the function works for tuples of any length, as long as both tuples have the same length.

The assertions provided in the code cover several scenarios, including tuples of different lengths and values. Since the function uses the `zip` function, which stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted, the function will only process elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. However, the provided test cases do not show any issues with differing tuple lengths.

Given that the function behaves as expected in the provided test cases and there are no apparent logical flaws in the implementation, the program is correct according to the problem description.
