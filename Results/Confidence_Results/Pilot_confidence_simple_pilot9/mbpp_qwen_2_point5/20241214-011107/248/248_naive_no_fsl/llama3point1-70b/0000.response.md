Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the elements of the list. This exactly matches the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (i.e., it will return a tuple regardless of the content or length of the input list), the program is correct.
