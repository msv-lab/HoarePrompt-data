Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly compute the n-th Lucas number for all cases. The Lucas numbers are defined by the recurrence relation \(L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}\) with initial conditions \(L_0 = 2\) and \(L_1 = 1\). However, the given function returns `1` for `func_1(1)` instead of `1`, which is correct according to the definition. But the issue arises with other values. For example, let's consider `func_1(2)`:

- According to the definition, \(L_2 = L_1 + L_0 = 1 + 2 = 3\).
- However, the function returns `1` for `func_1(2)`.

This discrepancy shows that the function does not handle the base case for \(n=2\) correctly. Therefore, the function is not fully correct for all potential cases.
