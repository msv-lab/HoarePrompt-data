Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
- \(L(0) = 2\)
- \(L(1) = 1\)
- For \(n > 1\), \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\)

The given function initializes the first two values of the sequence, `a = 2` and `b = 1`, and then iterates through the sequence up to the n-th term, updating the values of `a` and `b` accordingly. This ensures that the function returns the correct n-th Lucas number for any non-negative integer `n`. Since the logic is sound and covers all base cases and the recursive definition, the program is correct.
