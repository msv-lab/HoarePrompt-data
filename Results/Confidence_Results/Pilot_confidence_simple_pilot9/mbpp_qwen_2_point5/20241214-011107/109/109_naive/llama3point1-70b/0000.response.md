Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list in all tested cases. 

- If `list1` is not empty, it slices the last element (which is a single-element list) and replaces it with `list2`, which works as intended.
- If `list1` is empty, it simply assigns `list2` to `list1`, also working as intended.

There doesn't seem to be any edge case that would make this function incorrect based on the given problem description.
