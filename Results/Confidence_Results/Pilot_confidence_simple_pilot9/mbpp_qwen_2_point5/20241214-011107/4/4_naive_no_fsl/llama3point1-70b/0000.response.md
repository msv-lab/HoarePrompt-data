Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This is achieved by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers (`num1 ^ num2`). The result of this operation will have bits set to 1 wherever the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ. Counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result using `bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1')` will give the exact count of differing bits. If this count is 1, then the numbers differ at exactly one bit position, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Given the problem description, this implementation handles all potential cases correctly.
