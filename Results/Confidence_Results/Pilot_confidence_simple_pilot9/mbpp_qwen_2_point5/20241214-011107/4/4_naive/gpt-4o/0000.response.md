Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This is done by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers and then checking if the result has exactly one bit set to 1. The function uses the following logic:

1. `xor_result = a ^ b`: Computes the XOR of `a` and `b`.
2. `return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: Checks if the XOR result is non-zero and if the result ANDed with its decrement by one equals zero, which indicates that there is exactly one bit set to 1.

The provided test cases cover several scenarios:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because `13 (1101) ^ 9 (1001) = 0100` (which has exactly one bit set).
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because `15 (1111) ^ 8 (1000) = 0111` (which has more than one bit set).
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because `2 (0010) ^ 4 (0100) = 0110` (which has more than one bit set).
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because `2 (0010) ^ 3 (0011) = 0001` (which has exactly one bit set).
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because `5 (0101) ^ 1 (0001) = 0100` (which has exactly one bit set).
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` because `1 (0001) ^ 5 (0101) = 0100` (which has exactly one bit set).

Since the function passes all the provided test cases and the logic is sound, it is correct for the given problem description.
