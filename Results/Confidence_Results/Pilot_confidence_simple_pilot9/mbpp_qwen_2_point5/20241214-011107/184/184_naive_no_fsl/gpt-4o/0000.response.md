Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). Based on the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which is correct.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`, which is correct.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which is correct.

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the logic appears to handle all potential cases (including edge cases like even numbers, odd numbers, and mixed lists), the program is correct.
