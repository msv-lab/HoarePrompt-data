Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `func_1` function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and apply the `sorted` function to sort the elements in ascending order. This approach ensures that each sublist is sorted without altering the original structure of the list of lists. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, there are no potential cases found where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
