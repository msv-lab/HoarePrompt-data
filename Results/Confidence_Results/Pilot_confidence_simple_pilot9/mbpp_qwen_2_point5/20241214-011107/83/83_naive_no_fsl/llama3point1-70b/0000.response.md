Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly sort the list as intended. Let's consider the following example:

- Input: `[2, 3, 1]`
- Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3]`

However, the output of the provided function is not sorted correctly. Specifically, the logic used to reverse parts of the array does not guarantee a proper sorting order. For instance, the current implementation may not handle the case where the maximum element needs to be placed in a specific position without properly rearranging the rest of the array. 

To illustrate, let's walk through the example `[2, 3, 1]`:

1. `n = 3`
2. First iteration (size = 3):
   - `max_index = 1` (since `max([2, 3, 1])` is `3`)
   - Since `max_index` is not `size - 1`, it swaps:
     - `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:2] = [2, 3]` which is reversed to `[3, 2]`
     - `arr[:size] = arr[:3] = [3, 2, 1]` which is reversed to `[1, 2, 3]`
3. Second iteration (size = 2):
   - `max_index = 0` (since `max([1, 2])` is `2`)
   - Since `max_index` is not `size - 1`, it swaps:
     - `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:1] = [1]` which is reversed to `[1]`
     - `arr[:size] = arr[:2] = [1, 2]` which is already in the right order
4. Third iteration (size = 1):
   - `max_index = 0` (since `max([1])` is `1`)
   - No change since `max_index` is `size - 1`

The final result is `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct for this specific input, but the approach does not generalize to all possible inputs. A more robust sorting algorithm, such as Bubble Sort or Selection Sort, would ensure correct sorting for all inputs. Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.
