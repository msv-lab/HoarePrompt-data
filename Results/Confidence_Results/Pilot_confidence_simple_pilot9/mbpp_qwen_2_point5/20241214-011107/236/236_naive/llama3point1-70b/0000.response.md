Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the list `nums` is already sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, this approach is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where the list is sorted in reverse order. For example, the list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` is sorted in reverse order but will not be equal to its sorted version `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return `False` for a sorted list in reverse order.

A correct implementation would check if the list is either sorted in ascending order or sorted in descending order. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
def is_sorted(nums):
    return all(nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] for i in range(len(nums) - 1)) or \
           all(nums[i] >= nums[i + 1] for i in range(len(nums) - 1))
```

This function checks both conditions (ascending and descending) to ensure the list is sorted.
