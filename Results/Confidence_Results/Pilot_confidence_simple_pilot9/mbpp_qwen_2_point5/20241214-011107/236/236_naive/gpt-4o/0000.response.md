Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The given test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A fully sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` returns `True`.
2. A list with an unsorted pair of elements: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` returns `False`.
3. A list with a descending element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` returns `False`.

Since the function works correctly for these cases and the logic is sound, it is correct for checking if a list is sorted.
