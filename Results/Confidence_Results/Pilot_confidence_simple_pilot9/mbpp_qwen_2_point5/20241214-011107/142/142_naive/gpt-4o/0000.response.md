Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through each item in the list and checks if it is equal to the given element. If any item is not equal to the element, it returns `False`. If all items are equal to the element, it returns `True`. This logic correctly implements the requirement to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The provided test cases also cover different scenarios and confirm that the function works as expected.
