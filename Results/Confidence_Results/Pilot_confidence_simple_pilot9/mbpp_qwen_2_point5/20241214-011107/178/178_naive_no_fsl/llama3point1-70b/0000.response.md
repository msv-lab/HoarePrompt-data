Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list using a list comprehension and then calculates the sum of the rounded numbers. Finally, it multiplies the total sum by the length of the list. This implementation follows the problem description accurately for any given list of numbers. Since there is no edge case or potential input where the function does not meet the requirement, the program is correct.
