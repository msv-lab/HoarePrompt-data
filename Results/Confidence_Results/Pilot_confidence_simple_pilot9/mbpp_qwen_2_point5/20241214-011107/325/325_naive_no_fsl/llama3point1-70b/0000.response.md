Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program checks if the given month number is in the list of months with 30 days. However, it does not account for February (month 2), which has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year. Additionally, July (month 7) and August (month 8) are not included in the list but both have 31 days. Therefore, the program will incorrectly identify months like July and August as having 30 days. For example, `func_1(7)` should return `False` since July has 31 days, but the program returns `True`.
