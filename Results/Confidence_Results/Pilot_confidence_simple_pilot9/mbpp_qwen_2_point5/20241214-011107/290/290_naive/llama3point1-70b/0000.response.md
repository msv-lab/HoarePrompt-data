Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' in the middle of each word, excluding the first and last characters. The function splits the input string into words and iterates through each word, checking if its length is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If such a 'z' is found in any word, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` after checking all words. Since the function follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases, it is correct.
