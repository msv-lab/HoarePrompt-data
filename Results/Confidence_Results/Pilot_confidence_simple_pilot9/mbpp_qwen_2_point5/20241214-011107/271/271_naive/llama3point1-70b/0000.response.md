Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly computes the average of corresponding elements across all tuples in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the program to iterate over each position and sum the values. Dividing by the length of the tuples list then calculates the average for each position. Since the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement, and no edge cases or specific inputs can be found where it fails, the program is correct.
