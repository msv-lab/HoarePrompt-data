Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The examples given cover different scenarios, including different values and column indices. The function works by extracting the n'th element from each row and then finding the maximum value among these elements. Since the function handles the examples correctly and the logic seems sound for finding the maximum value in any given column, it appears to meet the problem description for all potential cases.
