Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. The comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) from each string in the tuple. This solution works for any input tuple of strings and handles all edge cases, such as empty strings or an empty tuple, without issues. Since the function adheres to the problem description in all cases, the correctness is **True**.
