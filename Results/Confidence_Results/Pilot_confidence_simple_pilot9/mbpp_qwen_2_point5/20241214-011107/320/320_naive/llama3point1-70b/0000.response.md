Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program finds the second smallest number by first converting the list to a set to remove duplicates, which can lead to incorrect results if the original list contains duplicate values but still needs to find the second smallest unique number. For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. The correct second smallest number is `2`, but the program will return `3` because it removes duplicates and sorts the unique numbers. Therefore, the program does not handle cases with duplicate values correctly.
