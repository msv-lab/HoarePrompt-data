Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in the list. Here's why:

1. The function first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the set.
2. It checks if the length of the sorted set is greater than 1. If so, it returns the second element in the sorted list, which is the second smallest number.
3. If the length of the sorted set is 1 or less, it returns `None`, indicating that either there are no unique elements (hence no second smallest), or there is only one unique element.

All the provided test cases are handled correctly by the function:
- For `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-2`.
- For `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-0.5`.
- For `[2, 2]`, there are no unique elements, so it returns `None`.
- For `[2, 2, 2]`, there is only one unique element, so it also returns `None`.

Since the function handles all provided cases correctly and the logic seems sound, there are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
