Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to create the desired output tuple. 

Given the examples provided:

1. `func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` results in `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which is correct because:
   - \(1 \times 5 = 5\)
   - \(5 \times 7 = 35\)
   - \(7 \times 8 = 56\)
   - \(8 \times 10 = 80\)

2. `func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7))` results in `(8, 20, 30, 42)`, which is correct because:
   - \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
   - \(4 \times 5 = 20\)
   - \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
   - \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

3. `func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15))` results in `(156, 182, 126, 135)`, which is correct because:
   - \(12 \times 13 = 156\)
   - \(13 \times 14 = 182\)
   - \(14 \times 9 = 126\)
   - \(9 \times 15 = 135\)

4. `func_1((12,))` results in `()`, which is correct because the input tuple has only one element, so no products can be calculated, and an empty tuple is returned.

The function handles both single-element and multi-element tuples correctly and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
