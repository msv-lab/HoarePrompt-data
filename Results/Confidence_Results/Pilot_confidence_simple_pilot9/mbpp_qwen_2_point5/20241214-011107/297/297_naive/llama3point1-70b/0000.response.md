Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This works for all potential cases:

- It handles tuples of any length greater than 1.
- It uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, which is appropriate for the described operation.
- It correctly computes the product for each pair and constructs a new tuple with these products.

Since the function correctly implements the specified behavior for all tested cases, the program is correct.
