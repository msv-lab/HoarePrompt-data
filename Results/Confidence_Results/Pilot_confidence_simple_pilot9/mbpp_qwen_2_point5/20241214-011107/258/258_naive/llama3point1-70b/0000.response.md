Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided checks if a number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) by comparing the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits to the original number. However, the logic in the program has a flaw. When `num` is a single-digit number, the loop will not execute because `num_str = str(num)` and `len(num_str)` will be 1. In this case, the sum will always equal the original number, which means single-digit numbers will incorrectly be classified as Armstrong numbers.

For example, the number 5 is an Armstrong number, but the program will incorrectly return `True` for the input 5 because:

- `num_str = '5'`
- `num_len = 1`
- `sum = 5 ** 1 = 5`
- `return sum == num` evaluates to `True`.

To fix this, the program should explicitly handle single-digit numbers as Armstrong numbers by adding a condition at the beginning of the function:

```python
def func_1(num):
    if num < 10:
        return True
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

With this modification, the program will correctly identify both multi-digit and single-digit Armstrong numbers.
