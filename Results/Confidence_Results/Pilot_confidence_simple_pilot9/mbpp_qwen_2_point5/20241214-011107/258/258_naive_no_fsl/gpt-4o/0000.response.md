Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong (or Narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(407)` returns `True` because \(4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3 = 64 + 0 + 343 = 407\).

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the logic aligns with the definition of an Armstrong number, the program is correct. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem description.
