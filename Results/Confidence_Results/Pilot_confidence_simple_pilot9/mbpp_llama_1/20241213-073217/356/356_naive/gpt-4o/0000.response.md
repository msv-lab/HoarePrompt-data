Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to remove all whitespaces from a given string. It uses the `replace()` method to achieve this. The `replace()` method in Python replaces each occurrence of a specified phrase with another specified phrase. In this case, it replaces each whitespace (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing the whitespace.

The unit tests provided cover various cases, including strings with single and multiple whitespaces between words, as well as strings with leading and trailing whitespaces. For all these cases, the function `func_1` correctly removes the whitespaces, returning the expected output.

Additionally, the `replace()` method does not distinguish between single and multiple consecutive whitespaces; it treats them the same, replacing each occurrence of a whitespace with nothing. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks to remove "all whitespaces" without specifying any conditions on how many consecutive whitespaces there might be.

Since the function correctly handles all provided test cases and behaves as expected for the removal of whitespaces (including multiple and consecutive whitespaces), and considering the general behavior of the `replace()` method in Python, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases regarding whitespace removal from strings.
