Correctness: **False**.

The given program only removes space characters (' ') from the input string, but it does not remove all types of whitespaces. Whitespaces in a string can include not just space characters, but also tabs ('\t'), newlines ('\n'), and other types of whitespace characters.

For example, if the input string is "Hello\tWorld", the program will return "Hello\tWorld", which still contains a whitespace character (a tab). Similarly, if the input string is "Hello\nWorld", the program will return "Hello\nWorld", which still contains a newline character. 

To fix this, the program should use a regular expression to replace all types of whitespace characters, not just space characters. The correct function would be:

```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```

This function will correctly remove all types of whitespace characters from the input string.
