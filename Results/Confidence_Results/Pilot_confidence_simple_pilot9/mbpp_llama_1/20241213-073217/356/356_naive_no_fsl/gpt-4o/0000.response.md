Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the string with all whitespaces removed. The function uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of whitespace characters (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing them.

The program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem. The `replace` method replaces all occurrences of the specified character (in this case, whitespace) with the specified replacement (in this case, an empty string), regardless of their position or frequency in the string. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness, as they cover various scenarios, including strings with multiple consecutive whitespaces, leading and trailing whitespaces, and single-word strings.

It is worth noting that the `replace` method only replaces the exact character specified, which in this case is the space character (' '). If the problem description intended to include all types of whitespace characters (such as tabs, newline characters, etc.), the function might not be entirely correct. However, based on the provided problem description and unit tests, the function appears to meet the requirements. 

In every case, the program correctly removes all space characters from the input string, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
