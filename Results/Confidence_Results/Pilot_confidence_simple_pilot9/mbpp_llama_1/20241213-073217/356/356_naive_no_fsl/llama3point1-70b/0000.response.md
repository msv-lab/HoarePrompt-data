Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly remove all whitespaces from a string. The `replace` function is only replacing space characters (' '), but there are other types of whitespace characters such as tab ('\t'), newline ('\n'), and carriage return ('\r') that are not being removed. 

For example, if the input string is "Hello\tWorld\n", the function will return "Hello\tWorld\n", which still contains whitespace characters. This is a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. 

To fix this, the program should use the `replace` function with all types of whitespace characters or use a regular expression to remove all whitespace characters. Alternatively, it can use the `str.translate` method or a list comprehension with `join` to achieve the same result. 

Here is an example of how the corrected function could look:
```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '').replace('\t', '').replace('\n', '').replace('\r', '')
```
Or using regular expressions:
```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```
