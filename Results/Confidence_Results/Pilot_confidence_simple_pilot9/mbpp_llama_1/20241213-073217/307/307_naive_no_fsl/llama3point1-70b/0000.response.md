Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function works by generating triangular numbers in ascending order and checking the number of digits in each number. As soon as it encounters a triangular number with `n` or more digits, it returns the index of that triangular number.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The key aspects of the code that ensure its correctness include:

1. **Generating Triangular Numbers**: The formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` correctly generates triangular numbers in ascending order as `idx` increases from 1.

2. **Checking the Number of Digits**: The condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` accurately checks if a triangular number has `n` or more digits. This is done by converting the number to a string and then checking its length.

3. **Returning the Index**: The function returns the `idx` (index) of the first triangular number it encounters with `n` or more digits, which aligns with the problem description.

Given that the code iterates through triangular numbers in ascending order and stops as soon as it finds one that meets the `n`-digit criterion, it should work correctly for all positive integer values of `n`. There's no apparent logic flaw or edge case (for positive integers) that the code does not handle, suggesting that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
