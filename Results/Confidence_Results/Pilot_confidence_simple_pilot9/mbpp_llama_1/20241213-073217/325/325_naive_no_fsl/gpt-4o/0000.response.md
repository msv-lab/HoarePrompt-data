Correctness: **True**

The program checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store the month numbers that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input and returns `True` if the month is in the `months_with_30_days` set and `False` otherwise.

This solution is correct because it accurately identifies the months with 30 days. The months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) and February (which has 28 or 29 days) are correctly excluded from the set.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function:

- `assert func_1(6) == True`: June has 30 days, so this test passes.
- `assert func_1(2) == False`: February has 28 or 29 days, so this test passes.
- `assert func_1(12) == False`: December has 31 days, so this test passes.

After reviewing the program, no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles all 12 months of the year.
