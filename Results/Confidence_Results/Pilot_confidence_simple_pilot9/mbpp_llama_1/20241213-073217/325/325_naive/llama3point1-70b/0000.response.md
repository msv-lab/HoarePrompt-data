Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function then checks if the given month is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This function handles all the potential cases correctly. For example, if the input is 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), or 11 (November), the function returns `True`. If the input is any other month number (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12), the function returns `False`, which is correct because these months either have 28 or 29 days (February) or 31 days.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases. It correctly handles all possible inputs (month numbers from 1 to 12) and returns the expected result. Therefore, the program is correct, and the function works as expected according to the problem description.
