Correctness: **False**.

The provided function is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The function uses the set() function, which removes duplicates from the list, but it does not take into account the frequency of the elements in the original list. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 1, 1, 2, 3], the function will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is correct. However, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3], the function will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is also correct. But if the input list is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], the function will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is correct, but it does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements because the non-repeated element in this list is only 3, so the correct sum should be 3.

However, looking more deeply into the issue I found that if we were to define "non-repeated" as "not duplicated", then I could not find any case where this function would not work as expected according to this definition. But, if "non-repeated" means that an element appears only once in the list, and we are to sum all such elements and not just the distinct ones, then this function should be considered incorrect because the problem description asks to "find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list" without further clarification on whether "non-repeated" refers to elements that appear only once, or whether "non-repeated" refers to distinct elements, and since the function sums distinct elements and the term "non-repeated" can also mean elements that appear more than once, I will consider it to be incorrect.

In the case where we are to sum all the distinct elements in the list (which could also be called "non-repeated" depending on context), the function would be correct. However, the term "non-repeated" can be interpreted as those elements which appear only once, and since the provided function sums all the distinct elements (not only those that appear once), this function would be considered incorrect if the problem description wants to sum only those elements that appear only once.

But the given unit tests seem to suggest that "non-repeated" is being used to refer to "distinct elements" since they do check this function with lists where the expected output is the sum of all the distinct elements in the list.

I would need more information on what is meant by "non-repeated elements" to give a more precise answer. If "non-repeated elements" refers to elements that appear only once in the list, then I found a case where the function does not work correctly: when there are repeated elements in the list, the function does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements because it sums the distinct elements instead. 

If "non-repeated elements" refers to distinct elements (i.e., elements that are not the same), then the function would be correct, but since the term "non-repeated" can also be interpreted as elements that appear only once, and since this function does not correctly calculate the sum of such elements, I will consider it incorrect.
