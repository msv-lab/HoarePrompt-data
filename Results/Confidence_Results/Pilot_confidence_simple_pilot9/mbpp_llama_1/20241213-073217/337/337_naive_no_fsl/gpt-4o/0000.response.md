Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it sums all unique elements in the list, not the non-repeated elements. A non-repeated element is an element that appears only once in the list. The function uses a set to remove duplicates, which is correct, but it does not check if the elements appear more than once in the original list.

For example, if we have the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`, the function will return `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, which is incorrect because `1` and `3` are repeated elements. The correct sum of non-repeated elements should be `2 + 4 = 6`.

Here's an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in count_dict.items() if count == 1)
```

This function first counts the occurrences of each number in the list, then sums up the numbers that appear only once.
