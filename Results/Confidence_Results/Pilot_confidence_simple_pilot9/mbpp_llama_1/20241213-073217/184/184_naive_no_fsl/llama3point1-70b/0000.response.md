Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is the definition of an odd number in mathematics.

Here's why the code is correct:

* It handles all potential cases: positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.
* It correctly identifies odd numbers using the modulo operator (`%`).
* It returns a list of odd numbers as expected.
* It doesn't modify the original input list, which is a good practice.

To confirm the correctness, let's consider some examples:

* Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` - Expected output: `[1, 3, 5]`
* Input: `[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]` - Expected output: `[-1, -3, -5]`
* Input: `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]` - Expected output: `[]`
* Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` - Expected output: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

The function works correctly for all these examples, and there are no known edge cases that it doesn't handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
