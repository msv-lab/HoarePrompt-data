Correctness: **True**

The given Python program checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number `n` as input and checks if it is in the list of months that have 31 days (`months_31_days`). 

This program correctly handles all possible cases because it accurately identifies the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) and returns `True` if the input month is one of these, and `False` otherwise.

For example, `func_1(1)` returns `True`, `func_1(2)` returns `False`, `func_1(12)` returns `True`, and so on. The function also works correctly for invalid inputs outside the range of 1 to 12, returning `False` as expected.

The program does not have any edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to produce incorrect results for any potential input. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
