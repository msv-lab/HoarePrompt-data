Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(nums)` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It does this by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version using the built-in `sorted()` function. If the two lists are equal, it means that the original list was already sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases. It handles:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function correctly returns `True`.
- Single-element lists: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the function correctly returns `True`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function correctly handles lists with duplicate elements, considering them sorted if the duplicates are in the correct order.
- Unsorted lists: The function correctly identifies unsorted lists and returns `False`.
- Lists with negative numbers or floats: The function correctly handles lists with negative numbers or floats, considering them sorted if they are in the correct order.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness:

```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3]))  # True
print(func_1([3, 2, 1]))  # False
print(func_1([]))  # True
print(func_1([1]))  # True
print(func_1([1, 1, 1]))  # True
print(func_1([-1, 0, 1]))  # True
print(func_1([1.5, 2.5, 3.5]))  # True
```

Since the function works correctly for all these test cases and handles all potential edge cases, it can be concluded that the function is correct.
