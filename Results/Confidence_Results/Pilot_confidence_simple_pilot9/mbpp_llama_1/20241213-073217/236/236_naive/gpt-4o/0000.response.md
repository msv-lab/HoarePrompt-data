Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates over the list, comparing each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it iterates over the entire list without finding such a pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The function handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly identifies sorted lists, such as `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`, and unsorted lists, such as `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` and `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`.

The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements. For example, an empty list `[]` is considered sorted, and the function would correctly return `True` for it. A single-element list `[5]` is also considered sorted, and the function would correctly return `True` for it.

In general, the function's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the definition of a sorted list. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description.
