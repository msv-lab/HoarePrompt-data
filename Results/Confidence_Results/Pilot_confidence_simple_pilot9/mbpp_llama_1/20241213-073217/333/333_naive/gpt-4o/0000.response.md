Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` checks if a given expression is balanced or not, meaning that every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket of the same type and that brackets are properly nested. 

Here's why I think the program is correct:
- It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far.
- It defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
- It iterates through the expression character by character, adding opening brackets to the stack and checking if a closing bracket matches the top of the stack.
- If a closing bracket does not match the top of the stack or if the stack is empty, it immediately returns `False`.
- After iterating through the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket and the expression is balanced, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, that means there were unmatched opening brackets and the expression is not balanced, so the function returns `False`.
- The provided unit tests cover different cases, including balanced and unbalanced expressions with different types of brackets.

I could not find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles balanced expressions, unbalanced expressions with closing brackets that do not match the top of the stack, unbalanced expressions with closing brackets without a matching opening bracket, and unbalanced expressions with unmatched opening brackets.
