Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the corresponding closing brackets are in the correct order.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. It correctly initializes an empty stack and a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
2. It iterates over each character in the given expression. If the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack.
3. If the character is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`.
4. After iterating over the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns `False`. If the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched correctly, so it returns `True`.

The function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Empty expressions: The function will return `True` for an empty expression, which is correct.
* Expressions with only opening or only closing brackets: The function will return `False` for such expressions, which is correct.
* Expressions with mismatched brackets: The function will return `False` for such expressions, which is correct.
* Expressions with nested brackets: The function will return `True` for correctly nested expressions and `False` for incorrectly nested expressions, which is correct.

Since we cannot think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected, the code is correct.
