Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. 

Upon examining the function, we notice that it iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last index and moving towards the first index. As soon as it finds the target element, it returns the index of that element. If the target element is not found after traversing the entire array, it returns -1, indicating that the target element is not present in the array.

Since the array is sorted, the function will return the last position of the target element if it is present in the array. This is because the function is searching the array from right to left (i.e., from the end towards the beginning), so the first occurrence of the target element it finds will be the last one in the sorted array.

This function correctly handles edge cases, such as:

- An empty array: In this case, `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)` will be empty, and the function will return -1.
- The target element is at the beginning or end of the array: The function will still return the correct index of the target element.
- The target element is not present in the array: The function will return -1 as expected.

Overall, the function seems to work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
