Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the start. As soon as it encounters the target element `x`, it returns the index of that element, effectively giving the last position of `x` in the array.

This approach works because the array is sorted. If there are multiple occurrences of `x`, the function will return the index of the last one it encounters, which, due to the reverse iteration, is the last occurrence in the array.

The function is also robust in the sense that it handles cases where `x` is not present in the array, returning `-1` in such instances. This behavior is consistent with the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further support the correctness of the function, demonstrating its ability to correctly identify the last position of an element in various scenarios, including when the element appears once, multiple times, and when it's not present.

Without being able to find a counterexample where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description, we conclude that the function is correct.
