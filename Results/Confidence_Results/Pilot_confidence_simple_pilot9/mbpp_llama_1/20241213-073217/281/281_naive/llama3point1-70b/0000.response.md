Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from the input list `numbers`. It correctly checks each number in the list to see if it is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, then the number is even and is included in the output list.

This function will work correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Lists containing only even numbers
- Lists containing only odd numbers
- Lists containing a mix of even and odd numbers
- Empty lists
- Lists containing negative numbers
- Lists containing zero

For example, if you call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`, the function will return `[2, 4, 6]`, which are the even numbers from the input list. 

Similarly, if you call `func_1([])`, the function will return `[]`, which is the expected result for an empty list.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so the program is correct.
