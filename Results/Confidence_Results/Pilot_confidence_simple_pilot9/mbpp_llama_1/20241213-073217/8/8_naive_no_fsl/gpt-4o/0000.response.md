Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the problem description. It correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the input string. 

Here's why it works:

1. It finds the first index of the character in the string using `s.find(ch)`.
2. It finds the last index of the character in the string using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. If the character is not found in the string, or if there is only one occurrence of the character (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), it returns the original string.
4. If there are multiple occurrences of the character, it constructs a new string that excludes the first and last occurrences of the character.

The function handles edge cases correctly:

- If the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string.
- If there is only one occurrence of the character, it returns the original string.
- If the character is at the start and end of the string, it removes both occurrences.

Since all potential cases are handled correctly, the program is correct.
