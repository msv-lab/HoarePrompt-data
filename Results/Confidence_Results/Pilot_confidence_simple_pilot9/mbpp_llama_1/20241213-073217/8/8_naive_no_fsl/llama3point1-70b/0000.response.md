Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s, char)` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character `char` from the string `s`. 

Here's why I think the code is correct:
- The function correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the character using `find()` and `rfind()` methods.
- If the character is found (i.e., `first_occurrence!= -1` and `last_occurrence!= -1`), it checks if the first and last occurrences are at the same position. If they are, it removes only one occurrence of the character, as there's no distinction between the first and last occurrence in this case.
- If the first and last occurrences are at different positions, it reconstructs the string by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at these positions), and after the last occurrence.
- If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `first_occurrence == -1` or `last_occurrence == -1`), the function returns the original string, as there are no occurrences to remove.

I have considered various potential cases, including:
- When the character occurs only once in the string
- When the character occurs multiple times in the string
- When the character is not present in the string
- When the string is empty

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
