Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided code actually performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. 

For example, given two tuples (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the code will return (0, 0, 2, 1) which are the results of the bitwise AND operations (10 & 5, 4 & 2, 6 & 3, 9 & 3). However, the problem description does not specify that a bitwise AND operation should be performed. 

It is unclear what "extract the elementwise and tuples" means, but based on the unit tests provided, it seems like the function should return a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in the two input tuples if the element in the first tuple is less than the element in the second tuple, and 0 otherwise.

A correct implementation of the function based on the unit tests would be:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a if a < b else 0 for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
