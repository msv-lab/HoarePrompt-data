Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, it does not work correctly for all cases because it assumes the size of the merged list is equal to the size of one of the input lists (which is passed as an argument to the function).

The program calculates the middle index as `size - 1`, which is incorrect because the total size of the merged list is actually `2 * size`. This means that when the total number of elements is even, the middle index should be `size - 1` and `size` for the two middle numbers.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Let `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, and `size = 2`. The merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. In this case, the middle indices should be `1` and `2` (for the numbers `2` and `3`), but the program calculates the middle index as `size - 1 = 1`, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the middle indices based on the total size of the merged list, which is `2 * size`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
