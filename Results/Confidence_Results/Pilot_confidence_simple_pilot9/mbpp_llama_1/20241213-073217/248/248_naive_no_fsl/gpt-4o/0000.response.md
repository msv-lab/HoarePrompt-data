Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple version of this list using the built-in `tuple()` function. The problem description asks to write a function to convert a list to a tuple.

The code is correct because it correctly handles the conversion of any list to a tuple. The `tuple()` function in Python is designed to create a tuple from an iterable (like a list), and it preserves the order and elements of the original list. Therefore, for any potential input list, `func_1` will produce the corresponding tuple, meeting the requirements of the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness with various lists, including lists of different lengths and containing different elements. However, it's also important to consider edge cases, such as an empty list or a list containing non-integer elements. 

- For an empty list `[]`, `func_1([])` correctly returns `()`, which is the tuple equivalent of an empty list.
- For a list containing non-integer elements, like strings or floats, `func_1` still works as expected. For example, `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'])` returns `('a', 'b', 'c')`, and `func_1([1.2, 3.4, 5.6])` returns `(1.2, 3.4, 5.6)`.

Since `func_1` works correctly for all these cases and there are no apparent edge cases that it fails to handle according to the problem description, the code is considered correct.
