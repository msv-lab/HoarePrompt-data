Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The implementation iterates over each item in the list and immediately returns `False` if it encounters an item that does not match the given element. If the loop completes without finding any mismatched items, the function returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the given element.

This function correctly handles various potential cases:

1. **List with all matching elements**: For a list where all elements are equal to the given element, the function correctly returns `True`.
2. **List with non-matching elements**: When the list contains at least one element that does not match the given element, the function correctly returns `False`.
3. **Empty list**: Although not explicitly tested, if an empty list were passed to `func_1`, it would return `True` because the condition (all items in the list are equal to the given element) is vacuously true for an empty list.
4. **List with different data types**: The function also works correctly with lists containing elements of different data types (e.g., strings, integers), as demonstrated by the provided assertions.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and its logic aligns with the problem description, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
