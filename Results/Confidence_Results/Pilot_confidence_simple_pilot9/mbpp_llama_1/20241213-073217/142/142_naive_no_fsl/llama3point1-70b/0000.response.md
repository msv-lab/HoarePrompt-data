Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an `element` as input, and returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.

The program uses the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all elements in the list are equal to the given element. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for lists of any size, including empty lists.

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

* `func_1([1, 1, 1], 1)` returns `True`
* `func_1([1, 2, 1], 1)` returns `False`
* `func_1([], 1)` returns `True` (since an empty list has no elements that are not equal to 1)
* `func_1([1], 1)` returns `True`

In all of these cases, the program produces the expected output, which suggests that it is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. After examining the code and considering various potential cases, I was unable to find any examples where the program does not work correctly, which further supports the conclusion that the program is correct.
