Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The `sorted` function in Python is used to sort the elements of each sublist. The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, which is typically the desired behavior when sorting strings.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The list comprehension iterates over each sublist in the `list_of_lists`.
2. For each sublist, the `sorted` function is called with the `key=str.lower` argument, which sorts the strings in the sublist in a case-insensitive manner.
3. The sorted sublist is then added to the resulting list of lists.

The program handles various edge cases correctly, including:

* Empty sublists: The `sorted` function returns an empty list when given an empty input.
* Sublists with a single element: The `sorted` function returns the original list when given a list with a single element.
* Sublists with duplicate elements: The `sorted` function preserves the order of duplicate elements.
* Sublists with elements of different cases: The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
