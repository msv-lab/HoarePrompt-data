Correctness: **False**.

The given function is supposed to check whether a number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. 

However, the given function does not handle the case when the input number has less than three digits. The loop inside the function starts from the second digit and goes up to the second last digit, and it checks for the condition where the previous digit is either less than or greater than the current digit, and the current digit is either less than or greater than the next digit. 

But if the number has only one or two digits, the loop will not be executed and the function will return True, which is incorrect because a single-digit or two-digit number is not undulating.

For example, if we call `func_1(12)`, the function will return `True` which is incorrect. An undulating number with two digits does not exist as the definition of an undulating number requires at least three digits. 

So the given function does not work correctly for all input cases. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
