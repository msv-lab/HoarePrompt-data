Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of even numbers. 
- The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` function generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n` (inclusive), which represents the first n even natural numbers.
- The `sum` function then adds up these cubes.

The code correctly handles all potential cases:

- For positive integers `n`, the function correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers.
- For `n = 1`, the function returns `2 ** 3 = 8`, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`, the function returns `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 = 8 + 64 = 72`, which is correct.
- For `n = 0`, the function returns `0`, which is correct because there are no even natural numbers to sum.

The code does not handle non-integer or negative inputs, but based on the problem description, `n` is expected to be a positive integer. If `n` can be non-integer or negative, additional error checking would be necessary to handle these cases. However, given the context of the problem, it appears that the function is designed to work with positive integers, and it does so correctly.
