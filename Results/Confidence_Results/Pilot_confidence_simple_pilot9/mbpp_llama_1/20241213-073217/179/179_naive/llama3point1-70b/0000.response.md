Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1(n)`, calculates the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown of why it works correctly:

- The function uses a generator expression to generate even numbers from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive).
- The expression `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` ensures that only even numbers are generated. The `2` as the first argument starts the range at the first even number, `n * 2 + 1` ensures that all even numbers up to the nth even number are included, and `2` as the step size means that every number generated is even.
- For each even number `i` generated, `i ** 3` calculates its cube.
- The `sum` function adds up all these cubes to give the total sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers.

To verify the correctness of this function, let's consider a few examples:

- If `n = 1`, the function should return `2 ** 3 = 8`, which it does.
- If `n = 2`, the function should return `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 = 8 + 64 = 72`, which it does.
- If `n = 3`, the function should return `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 + 6 ** 3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which it does.

Since the function works as expected for these cases and its logic seems sound for any positive integer `n`, we can conclude that it is correct. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail, assuming `n` is a positive integer.
