Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly calculates the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is given by (1/3) * Ï€ * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone. This formula is accurately implemented in the function.

The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. The `math.pi` constant from the math module is used to get the value of pi, which is necessary for calculating the volume.

The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as negative input values. However, in the context of geometry, negative radii and heights do not make sense. If the input values are negative, the function will still calculate the volume but the result will not be meaningful in the context of geometry. It's also worth noting that the function does not check for invalid input types, such as non-numeric values, which could potentially cause errors.

But, assuming that the function is used with valid, non-negative numeric input values, it accurately calculates the volume of a cone according to the provided problem description. Therefore, based on the given information, the correctness of the program is **True**.
