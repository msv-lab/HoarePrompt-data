Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula: `V = 1/3 * Ï€ * r^2 * h`, where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height of the cone. This formula is mathematically correct and covers all possible cases for calculating the volume of a cone.

The program uses the `math.pi` constant for precision and handles the calculation correctly for the provided test cases. There are no apparent missing edge cases, and the function should work correctly for any non-negative values of `radius` and `height`.

The function does not include error checking for negative input values, but since the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone does not define the volume for negative radii or heights, this omission is consistent with the problem description.

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct. However, to make the function more robust, adding input validation to handle potential negative or non-numeric input values could be beneficial. But as per the given problem description, the program works correctly.
