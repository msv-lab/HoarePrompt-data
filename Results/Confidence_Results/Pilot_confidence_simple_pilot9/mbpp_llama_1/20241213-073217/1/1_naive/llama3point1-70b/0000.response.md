Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists, which are represented as tuples in this case. The function works by first converting the tuples into sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. Then, it uses the `&` operator to perform a set intersection, which returns a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets. Finally, it converts this resulting set back into a tuple and returns it.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the shared elements between the two input tuples, regardless of their original order or the presence of duplicate elements. The use of sets automatically eliminates any duplicate elements, and the `&` operator efficiently finds the common elements between the two sets.

For example, if `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `test_tup2 = (2, 2, 3, 4)`, the function will return `(2, 3)`, which are the elements shared by both tuples.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs. It correctly handles cases with duplicate elements, elements in different orders, and returns the shared elements as a tuple.
