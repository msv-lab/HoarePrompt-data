Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples as input, converts them to sets, finds the intersection of the two sets (which represents the shared elements), and returns the result as a tuple.

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

* `func_1((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4))` returns `(2, 3)`, which are the shared elements between the two tuples.
* `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` returns `()`, which is an empty tuple indicating that there are no shared elements between the two tuples.
* `func_1((1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2))` returns `(1, 2)`, which demonstrates that the function correctly handles duplicates in the input tuples.

The program works as expected for different types of inputs, including tuples with duplicate elements, tuples with no shared elements, and tuples with all elements shared. The use of sets ensures that the function has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the input tuples, making it efficient for large inputs.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
