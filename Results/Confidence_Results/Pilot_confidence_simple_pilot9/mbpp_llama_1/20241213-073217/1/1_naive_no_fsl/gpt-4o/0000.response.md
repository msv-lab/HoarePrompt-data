Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it effectively finds the shared elements from the given two lists. 

Here's why the code works as expected:

1. The `set(list1) & set(list2)` operation finds the intersection of the two sets, which are the elements that are common to both lists.
2. The `sorted` function ensures that the common elements are returned in a consistent order, which is useful for comparison purposes.
3. The `tuple` function is used to convert the sorted list of common elements into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: The function will return an empty tuple if either of the input lists is empty.
* Duplicate elements: The function will only return each common element once, even if it appears multiple times in both input lists.
* Unsorted lists: The function will still return the correct common elements, regardless of the order of the input lists.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
