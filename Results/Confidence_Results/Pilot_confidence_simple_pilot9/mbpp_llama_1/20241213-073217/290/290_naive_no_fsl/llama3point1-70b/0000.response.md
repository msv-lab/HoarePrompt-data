Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct. It meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function splits the input string into words using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list of words.
3. For each word, it checks two conditions:
   - `len(word) > 1`: This condition is necessary to avoid checking single-character words, which would not have any characters in between the start and end.
   - `'z' in word[1:-1]`: This condition checks if the character 'z' is present in the word, excluding the first and last characters.
4. If it finds a word that meets both conditions, it immediately returns `True`.
5. If it checks all words and doesn't find any that meet the conditions, it returns `False`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty strings: The `split()` method returns an empty list for an empty string, and the function correctly returns `False`.
- Strings with only one word: The function checks the word as described above.
- Strings with multiple words: The function checks each word individually.
- Words with 'z' at the start or end: The function ignores these cases as required.
- Words without 'z': The function correctly ignores these cases.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
