Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order. If there are more than one unique numbers, it returns the second smallest number (at index 1); otherwise, it returns `None`.

This function works correctly for various cases, including:

- Lists with multiple unique numbers: The function correctly identifies the second smallest number.
- Lists with duplicate numbers: The function ignores duplicates and finds the second smallest unique number.
- Lists with all elements being the same: The function returns `None` as there is no second smallest number.
- Lists with negative numbers and/or zero: The function correctly handles these cases.
- Lists with floating-point numbers: The function correctly handles these cases.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, covering scenarios such as lists with multiple unique numbers, lists with all elements being the same, and lists with negative numbers and/or zero.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the function `func_1` meets the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
