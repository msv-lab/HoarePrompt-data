Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(matrix, n)` appears to correctly implement the described functionality, which is to return the maximum value of the n'th column in a given matrix. 

Here's a breakdown of why this function is correct:

1. **Matrix Representation**: The matrix is represented as a list of lists, which is a common and valid way to represent matrices in Python.

2. **Column Indexing**: The function uses `n - 1` to index the columns because Python uses zero-based indexing. This means the first column is at index 0, the second column at index 1, and so on. Therefore, the n'th column is at index `n - 1`, which is correctly handled by the function.

3. **Use of `max` function with generator expression**: The function uses a generator expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` to iterate over each row in the matrix and select the element at the `n - 1` index (i.e., the n'th column). It then applies the `max` function to this generator expression to find the maximum value among these elements. This approach is both efficient and Pythonic.

4. **Handling of Potential Edge Cases**: 
   - **Empty Matrix**: If the input matrix is empty, the `max` function with a generator expression will raise a `ValueError` because `max` requires at least one element to compare. This could be considered a limitation, but based strictly on the problem description, the function behaves as expected when the matrix is not empty.
   - **Column Index Out of Range**: If `n` is larger than the number of columns in the matrix, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access an index that does not exist in the row lists. Again, this is a predictable behavior given the inputs.
   - **Non-Numeric Values**: The function assumes that the matrix contains only comparable elements (e.g., numbers). If the matrix contains non-numeric or non-comparable values, the `max` function may raise a `TypeError`.

Given these considerations, the function `func_1(matrix, n)` works as expected for all cases where the input matrix is not empty, `n` is within the valid range of column indices, and the matrix elements are comparable. For these reasons, the correctness of the function is assessed as **True**.
