Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`.

The function handles various potential cases correctly, including:

1. Empty strings: If a string in the tuple is empty, `s[-1]` will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception. However, this is a realistic expectation, as there is no last character to extract from an empty string.

2. Single-character strings: If a string in the tuple has only one character, `s[-1]` will correctly return that single character.

3. Longer strings: For strings with more than one character, `s[-1]` will correctly extract the last character.

4. Tuple with a single string: The function will return a list containing the last character of that single string.

5. Tuple with multiple strings: The function will return a list containing the last characters of all the strings in the tuple.

6. Tuple with a mix of short and long strings: The function will handle strings of varying lengths correctly.

Considering these cases, the function appears to work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**. 

However, it is worth noting that if the input is not a tuple of strings (for example, if it's a tuple containing other types of objects, or if it's not a tuple at all), the function might not work as expected or might raise exceptions. But assuming the input is a tuple of strings as specified in the problem description, the function should work correctly.
