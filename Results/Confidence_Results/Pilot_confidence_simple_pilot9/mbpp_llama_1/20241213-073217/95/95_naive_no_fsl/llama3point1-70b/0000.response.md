Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because the function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring `'std'` in the given string `s`. This method is case-sensitive and does not overlap occurrences, meaning that it will only count each occurrence of `'std'` once, even if they are part of a longer string like `'stdstd'`.

The `count` method will correctly handle various edge cases, such as:

* An empty string: `func_1("")` will return `0`.
* A string with no occurrences of `'std'`: `func_1("hello world")` will return `0`.
* A string with one occurrence of `'std'`: `func_1("std")` will return `1`.
* A string with multiple occurrences of `'std'`: `func_1("std std std")` will return `3`.
* A string with overlapping occurrences of `'std'`: `func_1("stdstd")` will return `1`, because the `count` method does not overlap occurrences.

Overall, the program correctly implements the function to count the number of occurrences of the string `'std'` in a given string, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
