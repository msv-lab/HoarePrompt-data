Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given number has odd parity. The expression `n % 2!= 0` is a standard way to determine if a number is odd, as any integer number `n` divided by 2 will leave a remainder of 0 if it's even and a remainder of 1 if it's odd. 

This code handles all potential cases correctly: 
- It correctly identifies odd numbers (e.g., `func_1(3)` returns `True`).
- It correctly identifies even numbers (e.g., `func_1(4)` returns `False`).
- It also handles the case for zero (e.g., `func_1(0)` returns `False`), which has even parity.

Since we can't find an example where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the code is considered correct for determining the parity of a given number as being odd.
