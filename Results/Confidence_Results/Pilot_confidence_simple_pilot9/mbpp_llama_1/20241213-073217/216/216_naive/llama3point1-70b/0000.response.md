Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's a breakdown of why this function is correct:

1. **Sorting the list**: The function first sorts the list in ascending order using `lst.sort()`. This is necessary because the function needs to check if the numbers are consecutive, and sorting ensures that the numbers are in the correct order.

2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The function then uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. This is done using `lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1` for all `i` from 1 to the length of the list. If the difference between any two adjacent numbers is not 1, the function returns `False`.

3. **Checking for duplicates**: The function also checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list using `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`. This ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list, which is a necessary condition for a list to contain consecutive numbers.

The function works correctly for all possible cases:

* If the list contains consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), the function returns `True`.
* If the list contains non-consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 4, 5]`), the function returns `False`.
* If the list contains duplicate numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`), the function returns `False`.
* If the list is empty (e.g., `[]`), the function returns `True` because an empty list is considered to contain consecutive numbers (albeit none).

Overall, the function correctly implements the logic to check if a list contains consecutive numbers, and it handles all possible edge cases.
