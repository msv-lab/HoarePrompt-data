Correctness: **False**

The provided program is attempting to sort a list of elements using a variation of the selection sort algorithm. However, there are several issues with the code.

1. The `find_max_index` function and the `flip` function are using a global variable `arr`, but this variable is not defined in the functions. It seems that the `arr` should be passed as an argument to these functions.

2. The `func_1` function is modifying the original array, but it's not correctly implementing the selection sort algorithm. The algorithm should find the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swap it with the last element of the unsorted portion. However, in this code, the maximum element is being found, but then it's being swapped with the current element, not the last element of the unsorted portion.

3. The `flip` function is reversing the array up to the `end` index, but this is not the correct way to implement the swap operation in the selection sort algorithm.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
If we call `func_1([5, 2, 8, 1, 9])`, the function will not return the sorted array `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]` as expected.

To fix these issues, the code should be modified to correctly implement the selection sort algorithm. The `find_max_index` function should take the array as an argument, and the `flip` function should be replaced with a simple swap operation. 

Here is a correct implementation of the selection sort algorithm:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(arr, curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            arr[max_index], arr[curr_size - 1] = arr[curr_size - 1], arr[max_index]
    return arr

def find_max_index(arr, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
```

This corrected version of the function will correctly sort the array in ascending order.
