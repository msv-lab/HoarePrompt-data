Correctness: **False**.

The provided function appears to be an implementation of the Cocktail Shaker Sort or Bidirectional Bubble Sort algorithm. However, the given implementation has a flaw in the line where it tries to reverse the subarray from the beginning to the `max_index + 1`. This operation is not necessary and can potentially mess up the already sorted elements in the subarray. 

For instance, consider the array `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`. When the function is run on this array, it will not produce the correct sorted array. 

A correct implementation of the selection sort or any other sorting algorithm would not include such operation and would correctly sort the array.

Here is an example of how the function fails:

Input: `arr = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`
Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Actual Output: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]`

This is just one of the cases where the function does not work as expected. There might be other edge cases where the function fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **False**.
