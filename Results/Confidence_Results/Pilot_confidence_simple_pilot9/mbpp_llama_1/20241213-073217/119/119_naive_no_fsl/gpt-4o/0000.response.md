Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` first and `a` second. 

The program description requires the function to return a tuple with the second number and then the first number, which is exactly what the function `func_1` does. The function does not have any conditional statements or loops, so it will work correctly for all possible inputs.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different input values. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct and will work as expected for all possible inputs.
