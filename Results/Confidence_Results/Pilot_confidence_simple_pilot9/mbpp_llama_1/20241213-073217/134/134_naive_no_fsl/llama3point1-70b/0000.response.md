Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer `n`. 

Here is a breakdown of why the code works as expected:
1. The `math.comb(n, i)` function correctly calculates the binomial coefficient for the given `n` and `i`.
2. The loop iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, an `if` condition checks whether the index `i` is even by using `i % 2 == 0`.
4. If the index `i` is even, the corresponding binomial coefficient is added to the sum.
5. The function returns the calculated sum after iterating over all indices.

The code handles all potential cases correctly. For example, if `n = 3`, the function will calculate the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices as `math.comb(3, 0) + math.comb(3, 2) = 1 + 3 = 4`. This matches the expected result.

Since the code works as expected for all possible inputs and edge cases, the correctness is **True**.
