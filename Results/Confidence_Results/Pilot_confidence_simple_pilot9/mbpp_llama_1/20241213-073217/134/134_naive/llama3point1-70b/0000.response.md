Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` accurately calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The function uses the `math.comb(n, i)` function from Python's standard library to calculate the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `i` elements from a set of `n` elements. This function is designed to handle this calculation efficiently and accurately.

2. The function then iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. 

3. If the index `i` is even, the corresponding binomial coefficient is added to the sum.

4. After iterating over all indices, the function returns the sum of the even index binomial coefficients.

The code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws that would cause it to produce incorrect results for any input. 

For example, if you call `func_1(3)`, the function will calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for the binomial expansion of `(1 + x)^3`, which is `math.comb(3, 0) + math.comb(3, 2) = 1 + 3 = 4`. This is the correct result. 

In general, the function will work correctly for any positive integer `n`, as it correctly calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for the binomial expansion of `(1 + x)^n`.
