Correctness: **True**.

The provided program uses a list comprehension to extract the first element of each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The code is straightforward and handles the general case where the input is a list of non-empty lists.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:
- Empty input list: `func_1([])` returns an empty list `[]`, which is the expected result because there are no sublists to extract elements from.
- Input list with empty sublists: `func_1([[], [1], [2, 3], []])` raises an `IndexError` because the first element of an empty list cannot be accessed. However, this could be considered an edge case that requires additional error handling to conform strictly to the problem description for every potential case, but the presence of empty sublists is not explicitly addressed in the problem statement.
- Input list with non-empty sublists: `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]])` returns `[1, 4, 6]`, which are the first elements of each sublist, as expected.

To handle edge cases like empty sublists, additional checks could be added, but based on the given problem description, the program behaves as expected for non-empty sublists. If we interpret the task strictly and consider the potential for empty sublists as a case that needs handling, the program could be deemed incorrect because it does not specify how to handle such cases. However, given the direct reading of the task and assuming the input is well-formed (i.e., contains non-empty lists), the program functions correctly. 

Therefore, under the assumption that the input lists do not contain empty sublists (or the problem description implicitly allows for the behavior with empty sublists), the program is correct. If we were to consider the need for explicit handling of empty sublists as part of the correctness criteria, the assessment might differ. But as it stands, for the general case described, the program behaves as expected.
