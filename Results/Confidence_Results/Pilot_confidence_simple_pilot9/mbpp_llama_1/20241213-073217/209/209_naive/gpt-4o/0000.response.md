Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` uses list comprehension to extract the first element of each sublist from the input list `lst`. The function iterates over each sublist in `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist.

The function appears to handle all potential cases correctly. For example, it works with sublists of varying lengths and returns the expected output. Additionally, the function does not include any error handling for edge cases such as empty sublists or empty input lists, but it will throw an exception if it encounters such cases, which might be the expected behavior.

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the function's correctness:

*   `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` returns `[1, 3, 6]`, which are the first elements of each sublist.
*   `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` returns `[1, 4]`, which are the first elements of each sublist.
*   `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` returns `[9, 1]`, which are the first elements of each sublist.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error handling for cases where the input list is empty or contains empty sublists. If such cases are expected to be handled, the function would need to be modified accordingly.

For example, if the input list is empty, `func_1([])` returns an empty list `[]`, which might be the expected behavior.

If the input list contains empty sublists, `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])` throws an `IndexError` because it tries to access the first element of an empty sublist. To handle this case, the function could be modified to skip empty sublists or throw a custom error.

In summary, the provided function appears to be correct for all potential cases, assuming that it should throw an exception for edge cases like empty sublists or empty input lists. If error handling for such cases is required, the function would need to be modified accordingly.
