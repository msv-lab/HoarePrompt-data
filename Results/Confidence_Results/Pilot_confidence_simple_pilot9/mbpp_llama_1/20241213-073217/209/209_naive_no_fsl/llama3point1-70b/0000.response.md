Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case when a sublist is empty. If a sublist is empty, attempting to access its first element (`sublist[0]`) will result in an `IndexError`. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5]]`, the program will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the first element of an empty list. 

To handle this case, the program could add a check to ensure that the sublist is not empty before trying to access its first element. Here's an example of how the corrected function might look:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
```
Alternatively, the function could return a default value (such as `None`) for empty sublists:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] if sublist else None for sublist in sublists]
```
