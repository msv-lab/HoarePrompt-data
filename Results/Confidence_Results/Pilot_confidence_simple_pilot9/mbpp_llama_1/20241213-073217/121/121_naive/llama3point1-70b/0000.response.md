Correctness: **True**

The program provided consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The function `func_1` checks for primality correctly by iterating up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient method for determining primality. 

The function `func_2` starts with the number 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments by 1, checking each number for primality using `func_1`. It only counts numbers that are prime and satisfy the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, which is the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

Since the program correctly implements the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes and uses an efficient method for checking primality, it should work correctly for all inputs. The program handles the base case of n = 1 correctly by immediately returning 7. It also correctly increments the count of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes and stops when it finds the nth one.

Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code appears to be correct and should produce the correct results for all inputs.
