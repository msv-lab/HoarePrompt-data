Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It does this by iterating over each item in the input list. If the item is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively on that item, effectively flattening any nested lists. If the item is not a list, it is simply appended to the `flat_list`.

The program handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and complexity correctly. For example, if the input is a list containing both integers and lists of integers, the function will correctly flatten the list while preserving the original order of elements.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios, including lists with multiple levels of nesting and lists with both integer and list elements.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the description. The recursive approach used in the function allows it to handle nested lists of any depth, making it a comprehensive solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
