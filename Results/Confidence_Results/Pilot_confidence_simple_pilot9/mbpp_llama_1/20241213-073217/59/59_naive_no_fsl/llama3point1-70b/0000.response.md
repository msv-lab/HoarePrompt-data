Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list. The `sorted()` function in Python returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the three input lists into a single list, which is then passed to the `sorted()` function. 

The program works correctly for all possible cases, including:

- Empty lists: If one or more of the input lists are empty, the program will still work correctly.
- Duplicate elements: If there are duplicate elements in the input lists, the program will include all of them in the sorted output list.
- Negative numbers: If the input lists contain negative numbers, the program will sort them correctly.
- Floating point numbers: If the input lists contain floating point numbers, the program will sort them correctly.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the correctness of the program:

```python
print(func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [0, 7, 8]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(func_1([], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(func_1([-1, 0, 1], [2, 3, 4], [-5, -4, -3]))  # Output: [-5, -4, -3, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(func_1([1.5, 2.5, 3.5], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]))  # Output: [0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5]
