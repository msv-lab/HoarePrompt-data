Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, merges them into a single list, and then sorts the combined list. This meets the requirement of writing a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.

The program uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the combined list, which handles all potential cases, including:

* Lists of different lengths
* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with negative numbers (not tested in the provided assertions, but the `sorted` function handles this case)
* Lists with floating point numbers (not tested in the provided assertions, but the `sorted` function handles this case)

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle, as it simply merges the lists and sorts the combined list using a robust and reliable sorting algorithm. Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input cases, including lists with duplicate elements and lists of different lengths. 

Overall, the program meets the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution.
