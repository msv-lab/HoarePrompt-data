Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why I think it's correct:

1. The function takes three lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` as input.
2. It concatenates the three lists using the `+` operator, which creates a new list containing all the elements from the three input lists.
3. The `sorted` function is then applied to the concatenated list, which sorts the elements in ascending order.
4. The sorted list is returned as the result.

This implementation meets the problem description, as it correctly merges the three input lists into a single sorted list. The `sorted` function in Python is stable, efficient, and handles duplicate elements correctly.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles:

* Empty input lists: If any of the input lists are empty, the function will simply return a sorted list of the non-empty lists.
* Duplicate elements: If there are duplicate elements across the three input lists, the function will correctly sort them in ascending order.
* Negative numbers and non-integer values: The function will correctly sort lists containing negative numbers and non-integer values, such as floats or strings.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible input cases.
