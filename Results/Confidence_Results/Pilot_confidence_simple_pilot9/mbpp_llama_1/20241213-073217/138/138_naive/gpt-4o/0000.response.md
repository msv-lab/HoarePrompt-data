Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input, checks if the element exists in the array, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating the presence of the element and its index position. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`.

Here's why the program works correctly:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.
2. For each element, it checks if the value matches the target `element`. If a match is found, it immediately returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element.
3. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element is not in the array.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for several cases, including finding an element at different indices and returning `-1` when the element is not found.

To further validate the function's correctness, we can consider additional edge cases:

* An empty array: `func_1([], 5)` should return `(False, -1)`, which it does.
* A single-element array: `func_1([5], 5)` should return `(True, 0)`, which it does.
* A large array with the element at the beginning, middle, or end: These cases are already covered by the provided unit tests.

After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the function behaves correctly for all potential inputs, and therefore, its correctness is confirmed.
