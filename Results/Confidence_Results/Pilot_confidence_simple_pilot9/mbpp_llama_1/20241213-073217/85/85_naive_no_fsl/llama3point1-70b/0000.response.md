Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here's why it works:
- The built-in `max()` function returns the largest item in an iterable (in this case, the array), and `min()` returns the smallest.
- Subtracting the smallest value from the largest gives the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

For any array of numbers, this approach ensures that the maximum difference is found, as it directly identifies and subtracts the minimum value from the maximum value, covering all possible pairs of values. 

No matter the size of the array or the values within it (as long as it's not empty), this function will always return the maximum difference between any two elements. Therefore, without a single case where it fails to meet the problem description, the program is considered correct. 

Example usage:
```python
arr = [10, 3, 8, 9]
print(func_1(arr))  # Output: 7
```
