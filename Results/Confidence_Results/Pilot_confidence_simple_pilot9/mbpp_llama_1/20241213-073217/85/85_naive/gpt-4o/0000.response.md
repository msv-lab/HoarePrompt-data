Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the smallest element from the largest element. This approach correctly solves the problem because the maximum difference will always be between the smallest and largest elements in the array.

Here's why the function works correctly:

* It finds the minimum value (`min_val`) and maximum value (`max_val`) in the array.
* Then, it calculates the maximum difference (`max_diff`) by subtracting `min_val` from `max_val`.
* This approach ensures that the function considers all possible pairs of elements in the array, because the smallest and largest elements will always have the largest difference.

Since the function uses built-in `min()` and `max()` functions, which can handle empty or single-element arrays as well (although the problem description does not explicitly mention these cases), it can be considered to be partially robust in these edge cases. However, for a more complete solution, additional error checking or handling for empty arrays might be necessary, depending on the context in which the function will be used.

Given the provided unit tests and typical use cases, the function seems to work correctly and consistently with the problem description. Without a counterexample, the code can be considered correct based on the given assertions and the described problem.
