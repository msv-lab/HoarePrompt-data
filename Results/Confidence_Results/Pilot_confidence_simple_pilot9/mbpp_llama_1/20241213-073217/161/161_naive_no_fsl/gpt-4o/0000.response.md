Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values: 2 and 1.

The program correctly handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1. For `n` greater than 1, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` to the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) and then iteratively calculates the next Lucas number by updating `a` and `b` in each iteration.

The loop iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), ensuring that after the loop finishes, `b` will hold the n'th Lucas number. The function then returns `b`, which is the n'th Lucas number.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) confirm that the function works correctly for `n` equal to 3, 4, and 9. Additionally, the function's logic is sound and correctly implements the Lucas sequence formula.

Since the function's logic is correct, and it handles all potential cases (including the base cases and the iterative calculation for `n` greater than 1), the program is correct. There are no known edge cases or inputs for which the program would produce incorrect results. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
