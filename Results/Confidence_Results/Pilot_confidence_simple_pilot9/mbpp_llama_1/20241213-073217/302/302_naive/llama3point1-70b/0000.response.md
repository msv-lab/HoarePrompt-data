Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is a simple iterative function that checks each element in the array for a match with the given number. As soon as it finds a match, it returns the index of that element, thus ensuring that it finds the index of the first occurrence. If the number is not found in the array, it returns -1, which is a common convention for indicating that an element was not found.

This program works correctly because:

- It iterates over the array from the start, so it will find the first occurrence of the number.
- It checks each element individually, so it will not miss any occurrences.
- It returns the index as soon as it finds a match, so it does not continue checking the rest of the array unnecessarily.
- If the number is not found after checking all elements, it returns -1, which correctly indicates that the number is not in the array.

The fact that the array is sorted is not actually necessary for the correctness of this function, as it does not take advantage of the sorting to optimize its search. However, the function still meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
