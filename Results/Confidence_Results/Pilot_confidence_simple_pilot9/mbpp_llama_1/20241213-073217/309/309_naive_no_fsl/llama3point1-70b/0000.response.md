Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same or not. This function works by converting the string into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate characters. If all characters are the same, the set will contain only one character, and thus its length will be 1.

Here are some key points that validate the correctness of this function:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: For strings containing only one character (e.g., "a"), the function correctly returns `True` because the length of the set of such a string is 1.
2. **Handling Strings with All Same Characters**: For strings where all characters are the same (e.g., "aaa"), the function correctly returns `True` for the same reason.
3. **Handling Strings with Different Characters**: For strings containing different characters (e.g., "ab"), the function correctly returns `False` because the length of the set of such a string is more than 1.
4. **Handling Empty Strings**: For an empty string (""), the function returns `True` because the length of the set of an empty string is 0, but according to the problem description, it should check if all characters are the same. However, considering the empty string as a special case, the intention might be debated, but following strict mathematical logic, an empty set signifies no characters to compare, hence all characters (none) could be seen as "the same" in a vacuous truth sense. Yet, this is more about interpretation. 
5. **Input Validation**: The function does not include input validation to check if the input `s` is indeed a string. However, the function will technically work with any iterable, not just strings, and will still return `True` if all elements are the same and `False` otherwise. This is a broader application but does align with the core logic of checking similarity among all elements, albeit not strictly following the "string" part of the problem description if taken to the letter.

In conclusion, assuming the input is always a string (or at least an iterable), the function behaves as described in the problem statement for all potential cases regarding character similarity. If one considers the need for explicit input validation or handling of edge cases like empty strings differently, the correctness could be debated. However, from a purely functional standpoint regarding the task of checking if all characters in a string are the same, the function works correctly across the board for typical string inputs without delving into nuanced expectations around non-string inputs or the specific interpretation of an empty string.
