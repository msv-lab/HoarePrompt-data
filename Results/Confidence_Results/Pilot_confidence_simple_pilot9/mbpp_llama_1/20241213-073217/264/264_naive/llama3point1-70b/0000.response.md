Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input angle in degrees by `math.pi / 180`, which is the correct conversion factor. This function works for all real numbers, including positive and negative angles, as well as for zero. 

The function does not have any specific error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values. However, since the problem description does not specify any requirements for handling such cases, and the function will raise a `TypeError` if a non-numeric input is provided, it can be considered correct within the scope of the given task.

The conversion formula used in the function is mathematically correct and will produce accurate results for all numeric inputs. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is confirmed.
