Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This approach is straightforward and effective, as the `min` function automatically compares all elements in the list and returns the smallest one.

The function is correct because it handles the problem description for every potential case. It works with lists of varying sizes and containing different numbers, including negative numbers and duplicates. It also handles edge cases such as a list with a single element or an empty list (although the latter is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, the `min` function would raise a `ValueError` in this case, which is the expected behavior).

Since the `min` function is a built-in Python function, it is well-tested and reliable, and it is unlikely to contain any bugs. Additionally, the provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for several test cases, which further increases confidence in its correctness.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, it appears that the program is correct and will work as expected for all potential inputs.
