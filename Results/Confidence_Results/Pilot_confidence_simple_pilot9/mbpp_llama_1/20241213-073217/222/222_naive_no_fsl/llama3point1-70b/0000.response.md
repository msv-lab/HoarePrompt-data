Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It currently only removes individual lowercase characters, not substrings.

For example, if the input is "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW", which is correct. However, if the input is "Hello world", the function will still return "Hw", which is incorrect because it should return "H" or an error since it doesn't know how to handle the space (which isn't a lowercase letter).

Another example where this code doesn't work as expected is when the input string contains numbers or special characters, like "Hello123world". The function will return "Hw", which might be the expected behavior, but it does not specifically address substrings.

A case where this program does not work correctly is when the input string is "abcABC". The function should ideally return "ABC" because "abc" is a lowercase substring, but it does not because it only considers individual characters, not substrings.

To fix this, the function would need to be modified to identify and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual characters. 

Here is an example of how you can modify the function to achieve the correct behavior:
```python
def func_1(s):
    inside_lowercase_substring = False
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            inside_lowercase_substring = True
        elif not char.islower() and inside_lowercase_substring:
            inside_lowercase_substring = False
            result += char
        elif not char.islower() and not inside_lowercase_substring:
            result += char
    return result
```
However, there's an easier way to implement the function using Python's built-in string methods, specifically using the `re` module for regular expressions:
```python
import re

def func_1(s):
    return re.sub('[a-z]+', '', s)
```
This function uses `re.sub` to substitute all occurrences of one or more lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`) with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing them from the input string.
