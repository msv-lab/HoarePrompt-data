Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for cases where a string contains digits or special characters in addition to letters. According to the problem description, the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided code only removes characters that are not uppercase, which includes both lowercase letters and non-letter characters like digits and punctuation.

For example, if we input the string "He123llo", the function should ideally return "H123llo" by removing only the lowercase substring "e", but the provided code will return "H123llo" as '123' are not uppercase but are not lowercase letters either, so the function should not remove these characters. In reality, the code returns "Hllo" because it removes all lowercase letters and all non-letter characters. However, the main issue here is that it also removes non-letter characters.

Here is an example where the code does not work as expected: 
```python
assert func_1('Hello123World') == 'H123W'
```
The provided function will actually return "HW" instead of "H123W", because it removes all characters that are not uppercase letters, including the digits '123'. The problem description requires the function to only remove lowercase substrings, not all non-uppercase characters. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
