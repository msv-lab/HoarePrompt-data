Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to "add the given tuple to the given list", which implies modifying the original list by appending the tuple as a single element. However, the provided program converts the tuple to a list and then concatenates it to the original list, effectively adding each element of the tuple as separate elements to the list. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]` and the input tuple is `(4, 5, 6)`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5, 6)]`, but the program returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. 

A correct implementation would be to use the `append` method to add the tuple as a single element to the list, like this:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
