To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze how the program processes input and calculates the maximum points Polycarp can earn in the given time.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n`, `k`, and `M`, representing the number of tasks, the number of subtasks per task, and the available minutes, respectively.
   - It reads the time required for each subtask into list `t`.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - It calculates `total_time_per_task`, which is the total time taken to complete a single task by summing the required times for all subtasks.
   - A loop iterates through the number of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`) Polycarp could potentially complete.
     - For each count of complete tasks:
       - If the total time used (`time_used`) exceeds `M`, the loop breaks, meaning no further complete tasks can be considered.
       - The points for completing the tasks are calculated as `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
       - It then calculates the remaining time after completing these tasks.
       - Next, it attempts to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. It calculates how many times a subtask can be completed within the remaining time.

3. **Points Calculation:**
   - Points earned from solving complete tasks and any additional subtasks within the available time are accumulated in `max_points`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
The program has a logic flaw in handling remaining subtasks after completing tasks. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 0
1
```
- Polycarp has one task with one subtask taking 1 minute, but he has 0 minutes available (`M = 0`).
- In this case, he cannot solve any subtasks and should earn zero points.
- However, the loop iterating for complete tasks might falsely assume points could be calculated without checking if `time_used` exceeds `M` early enough.

Another example:
```
3 5 10
2 2 2 2 2
```
- Here, regardless of how he solves subtasks, he can only manage to get complete points for one task since the total task time is 10.
- If he could partially complete other tasks but relies solely on the logic that is constrained by solving subtasks in counting, he might miss maximizing his points due to how the subtasks are prioritized. 

4. **Evaluation of the Implementation:**
From the above examination, it is evident that:
- The points should be adjusted based on the possible maximum he can achieve while considering the subtasks fully and ensuring that the function considers if he can solve even one subtask from the subsequent tasks, especially when he has exactly minimal time to solve further subtasks.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle edge cases correctly concerning the limitations of remaining time after completing a certain number of tasks. The loop conditions and points calculation need adjustment. Thus, I found counterexamples where the program's logic might fail to return the expected results.

Correctness: **False**.
