Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn based on the problem description. The issues can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[i][j]` is set up to track how many subtasks can be completed up to `j` minutes while considering the first `i` subtasks. However, it does not account for multiple tasks (`n`) correctly or track the bonus points for completing all subtasks of a task.

2. **Scoring Logic**: The calculation for the total points earned is flawed. The current logic sums up the values in the last row of the DP table but does not appropriately factor in that for every completed task (k subtasks solved), an additional bonus point should be added. 

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: Certain edge cases where either `M` is extremely small (i.e., 0 minutes) or where the time taken for each subtask exceeds `M` (e.g., t = [10, 20, 30] and M = 5) are not handled. Both of these would result in a score of 0 but might lead to incorrect behavior depending on the summing logic.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails: 

- **Case**: 
  Input:
  ```
  1 3 5
  10 20 30
  ```
  Expected Output: `0` (since no subtask can be completed).
  However, the program would still calculate some points based on the dynamic programming logic despite no time being available, thus leading to an incorrect output.

The inconsistencies in handling the tasks and points scoring mean the program doesn't adhere to the requirements set out in the problem description.
