To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that the logic correctly computes the maximum points Polycarp can earn given the constraints on time and subtasks.

The main steps taken in the program are as follows:

1. Calculate the total time required to complete all subtasks in a task.
2. Iterate over the possible number of tasks Polycarp can complete fully (from 0 to n).
3. For each complete task, calculate the time used and remaining time.
4. Use the remaining time to solve as many subtasks as possible from the incomplete tasks.
5. Keep track of the maximum points achievable during this process.

However, there are potential issues in how the program approaches the subtasks. Specifically, the program assumes that you can simply use the remaining time for any subtask from any remaining task, which might lead to underestimating or overestimating the number of subtasks solved, especially if there are mixed requirements for tasks.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following scenario:
- When n = 1, k = 2, M = 1.
- The subtasks require times t = [2, 3].

In this case, Polycarp doesn't have enough time to solve any subtask from any task because the minimal required time for the subtasks exceeds M. The expectation is to return 0 points because no subtasks can be solved. However, the program logic might allow for a wrong evaluation due to the way remaining subtasks are treated in relation to the combined available time.

The function calculates how many complete tasks can be performed and based on remaining time, potentially allows for an incorrect calculation of completed subtasks resulting in positive points when it should be zero.

### Conclusion:

Given that under certain circumstances the code can yield incorrect results, it should be deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
