To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze what the code does in light of the requirements.

The task is to find the length of the longest substring of a given string that is not a palindrome. The program proceeds as follows:

1. It checks the length of the string. If it's 1 or less, it correctly outputs `0`, as a single character or an empty string is a palindrome.
2. It uses a helper function (`func_1`) to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
3. If the entire string is not a palindrome, it outputs the length of the string.
4. If the entire string is a palindrome, it checks two substrings: one without the first character and one without the last character. If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it outputs length `length of s - 1`.
5. If all checks fail (meaning all substrings considered are palindromes), it outputs `0`.

### Potential Issue
While the program performs mostly as intended, there's a critical oversight regarding cases where the string itself is a palindrome but removing either the first or last character could still lead to substrings that are not palindrome. 

For example:

- Input: `"aaaa"` 
  (A string where all characters are the same)
  In this case, `func_1("aaaa")` returns `True` (since `"aaaa"` is a palindrome). However, both `func_1("aaa")` and `func_1("aaa")` will return `True` too, and thus it would incorrectly return `0`, even though we can form `"aa"` (which is still a palindrome). 

### Edge Cases
- For the string `"ab"`: the program would return `2` (correct, as it is not a palindrome).
- For the string `"a"`: the program would return `0` (correct).
- For the string `"aa"`: the program would return `0`, which is incorrect, because the longest non-palindrome substring can also be `""` (which isn't considered) but we can also remove one to get a valid output. 

In the specific edge case of strings with repeated characters, the logic fails as it incorrectly assumes the maximum substring would be of length `0`. 

Based on this analysis:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle the case when the string consists of the same characters. In such scenarios where all characters are identical, multiple palindromic substrings are formed but the algorithm fails to account for the potential lengths of substrings less than the full string, leading to an incorrect output of `0`.
