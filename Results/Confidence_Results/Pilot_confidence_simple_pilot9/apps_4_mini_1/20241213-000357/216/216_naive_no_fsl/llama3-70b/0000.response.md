Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. 

The conditions for a "pretty set" require that:
1. The letters at the selected positions must be distinct and in lowercase.
2. There must be no uppercase letters in the string situated between the selected positions.

The given program simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string. This approach fails to account for the positions of uppercase letters, which can separate lowercase letters and invalidate the "pretty set". 

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aAaAaaAaaa
```
The expected output should be `5` because the lowercase letters `a` can form a pretty set at positions 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8, but the program would count all `a`s without considering the effect of the uppercase `A` letters that separate them.

Thus, because the program does not handle cases where uppercase letters interrupt the sequence of lowercase letters, it does not satisfy the problem's requirements.
