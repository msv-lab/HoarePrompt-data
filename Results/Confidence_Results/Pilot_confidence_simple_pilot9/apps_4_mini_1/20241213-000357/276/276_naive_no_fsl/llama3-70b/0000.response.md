To determine if the provided program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers in the golden system notation, let’s analyze the code and check for any potential edge cases.

### Code Analysis
1. **Inputs**: The program reads two non-empty strings consisting only of '0's and '1's.
2. **Functionality**: It defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the decimal value of the string `s` based on the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
3. **Comparison**: The computed decimal values for both strings are compared using standard comparison operators.

### Function `func_1(s)`
- It iterates over the input string `s` in reversed order.
- For each character `c`, it converts it to an integer, multiplies it by \( q^i \), where \( i \) is the index, and accumulates the total in `decimal`.

### Potential Issues
While the provided code appears to implement the comparison correctly for most inputs, we need to consider the following:
- **Precision Issues**: Python's `float` type can introduce precision errors when converting very large sums of irrational numbers. 
- **Leading Zeros**: The program does not explicitly handle leading zeros. For example, "00001" and "1" should be treated as equal, but it will convert "00001" into 1.0 and "1" into 1.0, which is handled correctly.
- **Float Comparison**: Since float precision may lead to inaccuracies in comparisons, especially as the size of the string increases (up to 100,000 characters), which means \( q \) raised to a high power may not yield precise results.

### Edge Case
Let’s consider an example as a test case:
- Input:
  ```
  10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  1
  ```

This input tests the upper limit of the length of the strings and their respective values. The first number is effectively much larger than the second number based on its placement of '1' in the golden system.

Given the complexity of calculating large powers of \( q \) and potential precision issues, the comparison may yield incorrect results due to floating-point arithmetic.

Therefore, due to the described issues with precision and large input sizes, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

The program may not work correctly for all potential cases, especially with larger strings where float precision becomes problematic.
