To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the program logic and the implications of representing numbers in the "golden system".

The program reads two binary strings (`a` and `b`), applies a conversion function (`func_1`) to each string to compute their respective decimal values based on the golden ratio `q`, and then compares them.

Here's the breakdown of the function `func_1`:

1. **Calculating the Decimal Value**:
   - The string is reversed, and each character (which is '0' or '1') is multiplied by `q` raised to the power of its position (from the right). This correctly implements the given formula for converting from the "golden system" to a decimal value.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program then adequately compares the computed decimal values and prints the correct relational operator (`>`, `<`, or `=`).

### Potential Issues:

Now, we should see if there are any edge cases or scenarios where the implementation might fail:

- **Leading Zeros**: The strings can have leading zeros (e.g., `00100`). The function correctly handles this because multiplying `0` will contribute nothing regardless of the position.

- **Efficiency Considerations**: The function employs `q ** i` inside a loop, which could potentially lead to performance issues when `i` is large. However, in practice, Python manages large floating-point numbers reasonably well, though computing `q ** i` repeatedly could be optimized.

- **Handling Long Inputs**: With input strings of length up to 100,000, while it should theoretically work, we need to ensure that the operations of floating-point arithmetic do not lead to inaccuracies, specifically with very large `i` due to the limited precision of float representation.

### Conclusion:

Upon review, the main challenge is in numerical precision, especially for very large powers of `q`. Given the constraints of floating-point precision in Python, errors can emerge in comparing two very close values, especially when they originate from a large series of terms.

For example:
- When comparing two very large values that differ by a small margin could yield an incorrect comparison (i.e., `func_1('1' * 100000)` and a string that may be very close in power representation but smaller).

Because of the potential for numerical inaccuracies in comparing very large float values caused by the restrictions of floating-point representation, the program may yield incorrect results in edge cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may fail in cases where inputs produce very close floating-point values that are susceptible to precision errors in comparison.
