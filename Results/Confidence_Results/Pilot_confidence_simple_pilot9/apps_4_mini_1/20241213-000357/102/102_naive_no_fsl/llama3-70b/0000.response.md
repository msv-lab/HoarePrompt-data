Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether Vasya can buy exactly `n` burles worth of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. Here is why it is considered correct:

1. The program reads the total amount of money `n`, the cost of one Ber-Cola bottle `a`, and the cost of one Bars bar `b`.

2. It then iterates through all possible counts of Ber-Cola bottles (from `0` to `n // a`). For each count of Ber-Cola bottles `x`, it calculates how many Bars bars `y` can be bought with the remaining money `(n - x * a)`.

3. The program checks if buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and `y` Bars bars satisfies the condition `x * a + y * b == n`. If it finds such a combination, it prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y` and exits successfully.

4. If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles on the two items.

The algorithm efficiently checks all potential integers `(x, y)` within reasonable bounds due to its loop constraint. The approach handles all valid input scenarios, including edge cases where either `a` or `b` is larger than `n`.

Given the program's thorough checking against the conditions provided in the problem description and the successful handling of examples and potential cases, it is determined to be correct.

Additionally, if `n`, `a`, or `b` are at their minimum values, or if `n` is less than both `a` and `b`, the program will correctly output "NO". All potential corner cases are considered under the logic applied in the code.
