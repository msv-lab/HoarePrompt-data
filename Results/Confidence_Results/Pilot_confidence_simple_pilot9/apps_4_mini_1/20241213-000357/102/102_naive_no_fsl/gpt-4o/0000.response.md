Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks all possible non-negative integers \( x \) (number of Ber-Cola bottles) that can be bought given the budget \( n \) and cost \( a \). For each possible \( x \), it calculates the remaining budget after buying \( x \) bottles and checks if that remaining budget can be completely spent on Bars bars by determining if it is divisible by \( b \).

Hereâ€™s how the program works:

1. It reads the amounts \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the input.
2. It iterates through possible values of \( x \) from 0 to \( n // a \) (the maximum number of bottles that can be bought).
3. For each \( x \), it checks if the remaining money after buying \( x \) bottles can be spent on Bars bars by verifying if \( (n - x \cdot a) \% b == 0 \).
4. If such a pair \( (x, y) \) is found (where \( y \) is computed as \( (n - x \cdot a) // b \)), it prints "YES" followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \).
5. If no valid \( (x, y) \) combination is found after checking all possible \( x \), it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all edge cases according to the problem description:

- The conditions ensure that only non-negative integers are considered for both \( x \) and \( y \).
- It efficiently finds a solution or declares it impossible without missing any possibility, even if \( n \) is smaller than one of the costs.

Since I couldn't find any example where the program does not work correctly based on the description, the correctness is established as **True**.
