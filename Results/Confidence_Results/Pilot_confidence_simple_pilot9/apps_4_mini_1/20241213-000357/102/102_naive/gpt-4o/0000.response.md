Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if Vasya can buy a combination of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars such that he spends exactly `n` burles. 

1. It iterates over the possible number of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`) he can purchase based on the budget and the cost of the bottles (`a`).
2. For each possible number of bottles, it calculates how much money remains after buying `x` bottles. 
3. It checks if that remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of Bars bars (`b`) to determine if a non-negative integer number of Bars bars (`y`) can be purchased.
4. If it finds such a pair `(x, y)`, it prints "YES" and the values, otherwise it outputs "NO".

The program correctly handles all specified inputs considering the constraints, and it adheres to the problem description. Therefore, I believe the solution it provides is complete and accurate for all potential cases within the defined input limits.
