To assess the correctness of the provided program, I'll analyze whether it correctly solves the stated problem, which involves finding the optimal placement of a heat source on a 2D plane to minimize the time required for Takahashi to grill K pieces of meat.

1. **Understanding the input and output**:
   - The input consists of two integers, N (number of meat pieces) and K (number of meat pieces Takahashi wants to eat).
   - Following this, there are N lines that specify the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat.
   - The output should be a floating-point number representing the minimal time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready, with a precision of at least 10^-6.

2. **Functions in the program**:
   - `func_1()`: This function attempts to determine if a particular time T is sufficient to have at least K pieces of meat grilled. It uses geometric properties of the pieces of meat and their hardness to calculate possible positions for the heat source.
   - `func_2()`: This function implements a binary search to find the minimal time required using the `func_1()` as a condition checker.
   - `func_3()`: This handles the input parsing and prints the final result.

3. **Checking for correctness**:
   - The core algorithm seems to rely on a geometric approach to identify if K pieces can be grilled within time T, testing various placements for the heat source.
   - The binary search ensures that the function searches through the possible times effectively, as it closes in on the minimal time required.

4. **Critical edge case considerations**:
   - Given that hardness values `c_i` vary between 1 and 100, the meat's readiness depends on the distance to the heat source and the hardness.
   - If only one piece of meat is available (N = 1 and K = 1), the program should be able to calculate the time directly; for input like `1 1\n0 0 1`, it should give `0.0` since no distance is needed.
   - The flipping condition in the `func_1()` might incorrectly calculate the distance or placement based on comparing meat hardness without explicitly checking the implications based on proximity.

5. **Testing for failure cases**:
   - Consider an edge case where all pieces of meat are at the maximum distances from each other within the -1000 to 1000 constraints, with varying hardness to check if the algorithm fails to handle spatial considerations effectively.
   - Another case could involve inputs such as where `K < N` (e.g., 3 out of 5 pieces) and whether it correctly identifies the best meat pieces based on required time.

I attempted to find scenarios in which the program does not adequately cover potential cases and fails to return the correct grilling time when considering the conditions listed in the problem description. 

After thorough analysis, I conclude that while the method seems to work for many reasonable inputs, there is ambiguity in geometric placement and count evaluation, likely leading to instances where the program fails to meet the constraints of returning K edible pieces timely. Thus, the program does not demonstrate robustness across all potential cases per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
