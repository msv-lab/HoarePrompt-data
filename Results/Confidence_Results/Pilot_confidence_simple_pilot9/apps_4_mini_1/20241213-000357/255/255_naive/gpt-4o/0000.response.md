Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string as described in the problem. It simply counts the number of contiguous segments of different characters, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string.

For example, consider the input string "aaabbbaaa". 
- According to the problem description, the operations would consist of three total deletions: delete "aaa" (first part), delete "bbb", and delete "aaa" (second part), resulting in a total of 3 operations.

However, the provided program would count this as having 4 operations because it counts the change between characters, resulting in a final output of 4 instead of the correct output of 3.

Thus, the code fails for this case and likely many others, making it incorrect regarding the problem's requirements.
