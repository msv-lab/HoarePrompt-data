Correctness: **False** 

The provided program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string, as it only counts the number of groups of contiguous different characters. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
aaaaa
```
The correct output should be `1` because all characters are the same and can be deleted in one operation. However, the program will output `1` correctly in this specific case. 

Now consider a more complex input like:
```
6
aaabbb
```
The correct output should be `2` because we can delete "aaa" in one operation and then "bbb" in another operation. However, the program's counting logic will analyze the changes in characters but fail to consider the fact that both "aaa" and "bbb" can be deleted in just two operations, not based merely on the transitions between different characters.

Thus, the logic to increment `ans` only based on changes between characters fails to address the central requirement of the problem: operations must delete contiguous blocks of equal characters, rather than just tracking different segments. 

In conclusion, the program does not consistently deliver the expected results across all cases, especially where there are blocks of identical characters to delete en masse, leading to overall incorrectness.
