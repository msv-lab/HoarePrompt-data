To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step-by-step.

The problem states that we need to maximize the expected number of fishes caught when we place `k` fishes in a pond of size `n x m`, with a scoop of size `r x r`. The maximum possible positions for the scoop are `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. 

### Breakdown of the code:
1. The function reads four integer values: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.
2. It calculates the total number of positions where the scoop can be placed:
   \[
   \text{total\_positions} = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
   \]
3. It then computes the number of fishes that can be placed maximally:
   \[
   \text{ans} = \min(k, \text{total\_positions})
   \]
4. Finally, it prints the expected value:
   \[
   \text{expected\_value} = \frac{\text{ans}}{\text{total\_positions}}
   \]

### Potential edge cases:
1. **Case when `n = r` and `m = r`:**
   In this scenario, only one position for the scoop is available, and `k` should not exceed 1. If `k` is greater than 1, we can only put one fish, and thus the expected value must be adjusted accordingly.

For example:
- Input: `1 1 1 2`
    - Expected Output: `1 / 1 = 1.0` (since we can only place one fish).
    - Output of the function: `min(2, 1) / 1 = 1.0` (correct output).

2. **Case when `n = 1` or `m = 1` and `r < n, m`:**
   If the pond is a single row or column with the scoop being smaller than the row or column length, the maximum position should also lead to placing fishes accordingly.

For example:
- Input: `1 5 1 10`
    - Expected Output: All fishes can be placed, thus expected value `1` since we can only scoop one at each position.
    - Output of the function: `min(10, 5) / 5 = 2.0` (this is incorrect because you cannot scoop more than one fish).

These cases show that the program does not handle certain edge conditions correctly since the expected values calculated do not necessarily represent the possible maximum captures of fishes. 

Based on the analysis above:

Correctness: **False**

### Summary of Incorrectness:
The code does not correctly compute the expected value when `k` exceeds the placements allowed or when `n` or `m` equals 1 as shown in the examples.
