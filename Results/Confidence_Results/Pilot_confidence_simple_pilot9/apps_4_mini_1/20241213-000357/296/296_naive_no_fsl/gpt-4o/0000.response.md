Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. Specifically, there are multiple issues with the logic when determining if a sequence of fractions can be generated such that:

1. The program checks divisors of `n` but does not handle cases where `n` is prime.
2. The logic `if not divisors: return 'NO'` implies that if there are no divisors found, it automatically returns 'NO'. This logic doesn't accommodate more complex scenarios where certain combinations could still yield a valid sequence.
3. The code needs to ensure that the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n`, but it does not process fractions summation; it just returns the divisors formatted as fractions without checking if their sum yields the expected value.

For example, consider the input `7`. The output of this program will incorrectly be `NO` because `7` is prime and has no divisors in the defined range. However, according to the problem requirements, we can break down the expected fractions such that their sum could still equal `1 - 1/7` with positive integers.

Thus, the program fails to correctly represent valid cases and does not encapsulate the expected behavior for all potential inputs.
