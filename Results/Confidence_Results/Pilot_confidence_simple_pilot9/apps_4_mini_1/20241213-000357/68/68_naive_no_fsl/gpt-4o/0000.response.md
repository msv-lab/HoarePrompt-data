Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s the reasoning for various cases:

1. **Case where `3 7 0`:**
   - Upvotes (`x`=3), Downvotes (`y`=7), Unknown Votes (`z`=0)
   - Here, the calculation would lead to:
     - `max_upvotes = x + z = 3 + 0 = 3`
     - `min_downvotes = y = 7`
   - Clearly, `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, so the output is `-`, which is correct.

2. **Case where `2 0 1`:**
   - Upvotes (`x`=2), Downvotes (`y`=0), Unknown Votes (`z`=1)
   - We derive:
     - `max_upvotes = x + z = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `min_downvotes = y = 0`
   - Here, even in the best case for downvotes, it is `0`, and maximum upvotes can be `3`, thus outputting `+`, which is correct.

3. **Case where `1 1 0`:**
   - Upvotes (`x`=1), Downvotes (`y`=1), Unknown Votes (`z`=0)
   - The values yield:
     - `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`
     - `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`
   - Since both counts are equal, the result is `0`, which is correct.

4. **Case where `0 0 1`:**
   - Upvotes (`x`=0), Downvotes (`y`=0), Unknown Votes (`z`=1)
   - This leads to:
     - `max_upvotes = x + z = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `max_downvotes = y + z = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Since the result can swing from positive to negative (either the unknown votes could count as an upvote or as a downvote), the output will be `?`, which is also correct.

In all cases that have been analyzed, the program’s logic aligns with the stated problem description. Thus, it appears to be functioning as intended without missing any edge cases or logic flaws.
