To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

The problem requires us to determine how much kvass can be left in the least keg after pouring `s` liters of kvass from `n` kegs. The code needs to handle certain scenarios:

1. If it's impossible to pour `s` liters (i.e., the total kvass is less than `s`), it should return `-1`.
2. If it's possible to pour `s` liters, it should return the maximum amount that can be left in the least filled keg.

Now, let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Sorting the Kegs**: The program starts by sorting the volumes of kvass `v` in the kegs.
2. **Binary Search**: It implements a binary search to find the maximum amount (`low`) that can remain in the least keg.
3. **Counting Total**: The logic checks if the total poured from the kegs is less than `s` using the intermediate mid value during the binary search.
4. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if the poured amounts with `low` result in exactly `s`. If they don't match, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic appears to be inappropriately implemented. The condition `if total < s:` should technically lead to adjusting `high` instead of `low`. This can lead to incorrect behavior as it doesnâ€™t adequately explore values of `low` that could feasibly satisfy the pouring condition.
2. **Final total check**: The condition `if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:` might lead to returning `-1` even in cases where the total kvass is equal to `s`. The way it utilizes `low` might lead to an incorrect suggestion of insufficient kvass.

### Found Case for Incorrectness:

Considering a configuration like:

Input:
```
4 10
10 10 10 10
```
The expected output should be `10`, as we can pour 10 liters in total without reducing the levels below 10. However, with the current logic implemented in the program, one can expect inconsistencies due to improper handling of conditions that prevent proper distributing of the kvass across multiple kegs.

### Conclusion:

Given the flaws observed in the algorithm logic and potential edge cases where it will not produce correct results, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
