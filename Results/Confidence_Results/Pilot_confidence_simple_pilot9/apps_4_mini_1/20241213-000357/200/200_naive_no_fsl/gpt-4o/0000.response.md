To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we must analyze its behavior based on the problem description and consider potential edge cases.

1. The program reads `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters of kvass the Fair Nut wants to pour).
2. It reads the volumes of kvass in each keg and sorts them.
3. It checks if the total volume of kvass across all kegs is less than `s`. If it is, the program prints `-1`, which is correct as it indicates that the Fair Nut cannot pour `s` liters.
4. If it is possible to pour `s` liters, the program aims to maximize the amount of kvass in the least filled keg after pouring.

Analyzing this approach, we should consider if the final logic for adjusting the `min_keg_volume` is correctly implemented for all cases.

### Potential Edge Case:
Let's consider a case where:
- Input: 
  ```
  3 6
  5 5 5
  ```
- Reasoning: 
  The total volume is exactly 15 liters, so pouring 6 liters is possible. The aim is to make the least keg contain the maximum possible kvass. 
  If we take 1 liter from two kegs and 4 liters from one, the kvass levels will be `[4, 4, 1]`; thus the `min_keg_volume` should be 1, not 5.

The program logic, however, will attempt to keep the minimum keg level as high as possible. In this case, it could potentially miscalculate the `min_keg_volume` after pouring.

### Conclusion:
The current logic for computing the remaining kvass and redistributing it does not accurately ensure that the end result reflects the described goal of maximum kvass in the least keg. The final adjustments based on `remaining_kvass` do not consider distributions properly after dealing with the kegs with a volume greater than `min_keg_volume`.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
