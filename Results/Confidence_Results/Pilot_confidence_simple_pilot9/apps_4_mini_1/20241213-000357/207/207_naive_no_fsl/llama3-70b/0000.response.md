To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and check for edge cases.

The function `func()` processes three inputs `m`, `a`, and `b`. It then initializes a list `dp` of size `m+1` with all elements set to `0` and sets `dp[0]` to `1`, which indicates that the frog can start from position `0`. The rest of the logic loops from `0` to `m`:

1. If `i + a` is within the bounds of the list, the program increments `dp[i + a]` by the value of `dp[i]`, effectively marking that there is a way to reach `i + a` from position `i`.
2. If `i - b` is within the bounds (greater than or equal to `0`), it attempts to propagate the number of ways to reach position `i` back to `i - b`. However, there seems to be a logic error here since the increment `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` makes it count the ways to reach `i` again from `i - b`, which is not necessary and could result in an incorrect count.

Let's run through some specific edge cases:

1. **Case with `m = 0`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`:**
   - Expected: `f(0) = 1`
   - The output should be `1`.
   - The program correctly calculates this with `dp[0]` initialized to `1`.

2. **Case with `m = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`:**
   - Expected: `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 2` (can jump to `1` from `0`).
   - The output should be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - The program will correctly calculate this.

3. **Case with large numbers, e.g., `m = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 1`:**
   - The frog can jump in just one way to reach up to position `10`. The expected behavior for other values of `i` would also derive from `0`, with `f(i) = i + 1` for the range `[0, 10]`, leading to a sum of `66`.
   - The code incorrectly computes combinations here and may produce invalid counts for `f(i)`.

4. **Case with `m = 6`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`:**
   - Expected: The frog can reach only `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` initially, then `4` and beyond infrequently depending on jumping mechanics. Thus expected behavior suggests `f(4) = 3`, `f(5) = 3`, `f(6) = 4`.
   - The counts might yield incorrect values due to the propagation error.

Errors arise predominantly from how the `dp` list is managed, particularly during the second jump case, causing potentially incorrect accounting of reachable positions.

Thus, we see there are several potential cases where the program does not align with the given problem statement. 

Correctness: **False**
