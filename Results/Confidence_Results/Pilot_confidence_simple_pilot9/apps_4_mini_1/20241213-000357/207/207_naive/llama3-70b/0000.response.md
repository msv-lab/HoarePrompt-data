To verify the correctness of the program, we need to examine whether the implementation accurately computes the required sum defined in the problem statement.

The program attempts to create a dynamic programming approach by maintaining an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` counts the number of distinct integers the frog can reach at position `i`. The frog can jump to `k + a` or `k - b`.

However, there are several potential issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Dynamic Programming Transition**: The way `dp[i]` is updated is problematic. Specifically, when a jump back from `k` to `k - b` is attempted, the code incorrectly adds to `dp[i]` based on the previous value at `dp[i - b]` instead of ensuring it counts how many positions the frog can reach correctly. This could cause `dp[i]` to incorrectly accumulate counts of distinct positions rather than distinct ways to reach each position.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The current implementation does not effectively handle cases where the frog might not be able to jump backwards (if $k - b < 0$). The condition to update `dp[i]` may lead to incorrect values, as positions may be revisited rather than counted distinctly.

3. **Efficiency Concerns**: The program creates a list of size `m + 1`, which might lead to memory issues for large `m`. Moreover, it appears to take $O(m)$ time, which is not optimal for the upper limit ($10^9$).

4. **Potential Calculation Failure**: If `a` and `b` are such that for all positions $0$ to $m$, certain positions are unreachable due to the jump restrictions, this code would not reliably count these cases, leading to erroneous results.

To illustrate a failing test case:

Consider `m = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`. The valid reachable positions from `0` are only `0` and `2`, leading to `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, `f(2) = 1`, `f(3) = 2`, `f(4) = 2`, `f(5) = 2`, while the implementation inaccurately counts more reachable numbers. Specifically, `dp[3]`, `dp[4]`, and `dp[5]` would be incorrectly updated due to wrong logic.

Hence, the program does not accurately compute `f(i)` for all potential cases of `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Correctness: **False**.
