Correctness: **False**

The program tries to calculate the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts, such that two pairs of parts can each form a side of a rectangle and do not form a square. 

However, an important edge case that the program does not handle correctly is when `n` is less than 8. For any input `n < 8`, it is impossible to split the stick into four parts with positive integer lengths that can form a rectangle while avoiding squares. Thus, for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, `n = 4`, `n = 5`, `n = 6`, and `n = 7`, the expected output should be `0`. 

The program does not have any checks or conditions for such small values of `n`, meaning it may return an incorrect answer (it initializes `ways` to 0, and it would remain 0 for valid cases but does not account for cases where it may incorrectly proceed based on the inner loops). Therefore, the implementation does not correctly cover all potential cases described in the prompt. 

For instance:
- For `n = 5`, the expected output is `0`; however, the program would return `0` because it doesn't enter the loop, but if further miscalculations were involved for some larger `n` that might confuse the condition, it could output an incorrect value.

Thus, the program fails to account for all cases correctly, leading to a general conclusion of incorrectness.
