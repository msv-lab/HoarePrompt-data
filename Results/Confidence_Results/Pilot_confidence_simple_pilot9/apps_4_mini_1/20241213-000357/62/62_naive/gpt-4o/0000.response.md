Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It first reads the base and digit representations of both numbers as described in the problem. Then, it converts each number from its respective base to a decimal (base-10) value using the `func_1` function. Finally, it compares the converted decimal values and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ('<', '>', or '=') as specified in the requirements.

The logic in `func_1` successfully handles the conversion from base `b_x` and `b_y` to decimal, taking into account the proper accumulation of digit values. Since both numbers X and Y have valid representations and the provided program handles edge cases (like numbers of different lengths and digits) as specified, I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Overall, the program is sound and adheres to the specifications, thus it is correct.
