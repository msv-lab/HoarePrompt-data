To evaluate the correctness of the program provided in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider edge cases.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function Structure**: 
   - The main function `func_1` attempts to check every possible segment length. For each segment length, it calculates the target sum and then tries to segment the ticket into parts whose sums match this target.
   
2. **Logic**:
   - For each segment length, it computes the sum of the first segment as `target_sum`.
   - It then iterates through the digits in the ticket and accumulates their sum (`current_sum`).
   - Whenever `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, it resets `current_sum` and increments `segment_count`.
   - At the end of each iteration of the outer loop, if `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is greater than 1, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no valid segmentation is found across all possible segment lengths, it returns 'NO'.

### Consider Edge Cases

1. **Minimum Input Case**:
   - Given `n = 2`, if the digits are `11`, the sums would be the same but cannot form two segments since there are only two digits. The output should be `NO`, and this is indeed what the function would return.

2. **All Zeros**:
   - If the digits are `0000`, the function would return `YES` as it can divide into multiple segments of zero sum.

3. **Maximal Case with Equal Sums**:
   - Input `n = 6` with digits `123321`: The function should correctly identify that it can segment them into `1`, `2`, `3` and `3`, `2`, `1` with equal sums.

4. **Case with Indivisible Segments**:
   - Input `n = 5` with `54321`: No possible segments can have equal sums. The function should return `NO`, which it correctly does.

### Potential Issue

While reviewing these cases, there is one area of concern:

- The loop that checks segment lengths starts from `1` to `n-1`, but logically continues using segments until the end of the string might not cover all potential bases. In the due process of segmenting, if a sum is encountered that equals `target_sum`, the code does not necessarily ensure that remaining digits also form valid segments.

Thus, the program can fail in certain cases to accurately identify whether a segment can be formed from remaining digits due to the way `current_sum` is reset and `segment_count` is checked. 

### Conclusion

Considering the analysis and potential edge cases, the program fails in specific situations where valid segments cannot be created with the segment behavior inaccurately handling some inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
