To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze whether it meets all specified requirements.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Specification**: The program expects three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from input.
2. **Area Condition**: It checks if the area \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer by using the modulo operation \( n * m \% k \). If the modulo is not zero, it prints "NO", which is appropriate.
3. **Finding Points**: It defines a function `func_3(a, b)` which seems to be invoking the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find integer solutions.
4. **Triangle Area Validity**: After obtaining the values from `func_3`, it checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g` to decide if valid points can be printed.

### Potential Issue
The following key considerations raise concerns about the programâ€™s correctness:
- The variables \( n1 \) and \( m1 \) are derived from `func_3`, but the `g` value being checked does not guarantee the area condition \( \frac{nm}{k} \) can be achieved reliably with the printed points.
- The area must strictly equal \( \frac{nm}{k} \), but the output points rely on whether \( abs(n1 * m) >= g \), which does not guarantee the specific area condition. This raises the concern that the points printed may not yield the expected area.

### Test Case
Consider a test case where the area does result in a non-integer value:
```
Input: 4 4 7
Expected Output: NO
```
In this case, \( nm/k = 16/7 \) is not a valid area.

However, assume we input values that seem to satisfy the area constraint:
```
Input: 1 1 2
```
The area should be:
\[ \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5 \]
But checking values derived from `func_3` might not allow producing three distinct points \( (x_i, y_i) \) that form a valid triangle meeting the area requirement because integer coordinates might not actually be able to yield an area of 0.5.

### Conclusion
Given the logical breakdown and the potential areas where the calculation can fail:

Correctness: **False**.
