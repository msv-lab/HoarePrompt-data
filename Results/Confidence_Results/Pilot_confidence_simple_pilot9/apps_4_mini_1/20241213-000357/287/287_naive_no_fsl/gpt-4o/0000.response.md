Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The program attempts to count the number of divisors of the integer `n`, which is not the same as counting the number of different weights of splits of `n`.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the input `n = 7`. The weights of the splits for `7` are as follows:
- Weight 1: `[7]`
- Weight 2: `[3, 3, 1]`
- Weight 3: `[2, 2, 2, 1]`
- Weight 7: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

The correct answer for this input should be `4`, as there are 4 distinct weights.

However, the program calculates the number of divisors of `7`, which is `2` (factors `1` and `7`), thus providing an incorrect output.

Therefore, since the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and fails to handle the example cases correctly, it is not correct.
