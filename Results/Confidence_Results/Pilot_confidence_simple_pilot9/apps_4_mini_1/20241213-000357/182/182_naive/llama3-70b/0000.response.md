To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze whether it handles all edge cases and requirements specified in the task.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The input is read as an integer which represents the rotation angle of the camera. This is correctly implemented, and the input is reduced modulo 360 to ensure it stays within the valid range of degrees for rotation.

2. **Output**:
   - If the resulting angle `x % 360` equals 0, it prints `0`, indicating no turns are required. This is also correct as no adjustment is needed when the camera is aligned vertically.
   
3. **Calculation of Turns**:
   - For cases where the angle is not 0, the code `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` attempts to calculate the required number of 90-degree clockwise turns.
   - This formula seems to be intended to round up and give the necessary number of 90-degree rotations by flooring the division after adjusting for any remainder. However, it does not handle negative angles appropriately.

### Potential Issue:
When the camera is rotated negative degrees (e.g., -60), the resulting approach should adequately address the requisite turns. Specifically:
- For an angle of -60 degrees:
  - The effective clockwise angle from the standpoint of the image is `360 - 60 = 300` degrees.
  - The number of 90-degree turns required to adjust 300 degrees clockwise would be calculated by `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which simplifies to `3` (since effectively it should be 300 clockwise = 60 counter-clockwise, and we need three 90-degree clockwise turns to reach the minimum deviation).
  
These checks are accurately performed, but the correct logic to deal with negative rotations might not be fully accounted for when simplifying with the modulo.

### Final Check:
Testing various edge cases, including:
1. Angles just below -90 (e.g. -91), which may return incorrect logic due to the flooring behavior when adjusted.
2. Angles from -360 to 360, especially near boundaries.

### Conclusion:
Due to the potential miscalculation with negative and boundary cases, we cannot directly ensure the correctness of edge handling. Therefore, we can confidently state:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program has issues with correctly calculating the required number of 90-degree clockwise turns for certain negative angles leading to incorrect outputs. An example that's not handled correctly is `-90`, which should return `2` but doesn't properly reflect this due to how the formula interacts with negative inputs.
