Correctness: **False**.

The logic in the provided program does not account for all possible rotations and potential values of `x`. 

For example, consider the input `270`. The expected output, considering that `270` degrees clockwise means an equivalent of `90` degrees counter-clockwise after correcting for the 90-degree clockwise turns would be `1` (since you need one 90-degree clockwise turn to correct it). However, the program would calculate:
- `normalized_angle = 270 % 360 = 270`
- `turns = (360 - 270) // 90 % 4 = 90 // 90 % 4 = 1`

For `x = -90`, the expected output should be `3`, as three 90-degree clockwise rotations would correct the image to be upright. However, the program would incorrectly compute:
- `normalized_angle = -90 % 360 = 270`
- `turns = (360 - 270) // 90 % 4 = 90 // 90 % 4 = 1`

Thus, in this case, the output would be `1` instead of the correct `3`. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all scenarios as per the problem description.
