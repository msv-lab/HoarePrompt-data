To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how the operations on matrix `B` are conducted to achieve equivalence with matrix `A`. Let's break down the logic of the code and evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and then fills the matrix `A` based on the user input.
2. **Determine Operations**: The program iterates over possible positions in matrix `A` to check if a `2x2` all `1`s submatrix can be formed. If not all elements in the `2x2` square are `1`s and at least one is `1`, it adds the position to the operations list `ops`.
3. **Output**: If the number of operations exceeds `2500`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the number of operations followed by the operation coordinates.

### Potential Issue
The crucial flaw in this approach arises when trying to achieve equality between matrices `A` and `B`. The code fails to ensure that all `1`s in `A` can actually be created by only choosing `2x2` submatrices. 

### Counter Example
Consider the following matrix `A`:
```
n = 3, m = 3
A = [[1, 0, 1],
     [1, 0, 1],
     [0, 0, 0]]
```
In this case, despite the presence of `1`s, there are no `2x2` submatrices that can be formed to make the necessary changes because the `1`s are isolated, and the remaining `0`s prevent any valid operation. However, the program logic will not catch this scenario effectively. It will attempt adding operations at positions `(1, 1)` and `(1, 3)` resulting in incorrect operations since operations at `(1, 1)` would require creating a `2x2` which overlaps with `(1, 2)`.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not check to ensure that every `1` in matrix `A` can be achieved using the allowed operations, it can miss such isolated `1`s, leading to a situation where making `B` equal to `A` is impossible.

Therefore, the program's correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
