Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a `while` loop to check whether Limak's weight (a), which triples each year, exceeds Bob's weight (b), which doubles each year. The loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight. For every iteration of the loop, it increments the year count, eventually printing the number of full years it takes for Limak to weigh more than Bob.

The program correctly handles all edge cases described in the problem statement:

1. For inputs where both Limak and Bob initially weigh the same, the output is 1, which satisfies the requirement that Limak needs to be strictly heavier than Bob.
2. For various weight combinations provided by the input examples, the program accurately calculates the number of years required for Limak to surpass Bob's weight.

Since all potential scenarios and examples given in the problem statement are effectively handled, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
