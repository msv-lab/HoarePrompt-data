Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle certain edge cases, specifically when the cursor is already within the range `[l, r]` or when `l` is on the far left and `r` is on the far right. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3 2 4
```
In this case, Luba starts at position 3 and the required range is from 2 to 4. The correct output should be `1` since she only needs to close the tab to the right (tab 5), but the program will output `2` because it calculates the distance to tab 2 (1 second) and also incorrectly adds a closing time for tabs outside the range. 

Another case to illustrate the problem:
```
5 1 1 5
```
Here, Luba starts at position 1 and wants to keep all tabs open (1 to 5). The correct output is `0` because no action is needed, but you cannot fully guarantee that the program handles this scenario correctly given its current logic.

Thus, the failure in handling certain configurations results in an incorrect total time, leading to a verdict of **False**.
