Correctness: **False**.

The program doesn't correctly handle the situation where the cursor position is between `l` and `r`. For example, if we input `5 3 2 4`, the expected output should be `0` since Luba doesn't need to perform any operations because all required tabs are already open. However, the logic in the program doesn't account for this case correctly and may produce an incorrect count of seconds.
