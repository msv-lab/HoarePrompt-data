To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program step by step. 

The problem requires finding a positive integer `t` such that all sticks' lengths are "almost good" for `t`, defined as having lengths within 1 unit away from `t`. The goal is also to minimize the cost of changing the lengths of the sticks.

1. **Understanding the program**: 
   - The program iterates over possible values of `t` from 1 to 100.
   - For each `t`, it calculates the total cost of adjusting each stick length according to whether it is less than `t - 1` or greater than `t + 1`, which is relevant for determining how far each stick is from being "almost good."
   - It maintains track of the minimum cost found and the corresponding `t`.

2. **Identifying potential issues**:
   - The program improperly calculates the cost of adjustments:
     - If `length` is less than `t - 1`, the adjustment to make it "almost good" is `t - 1 - length`.
     - However, if `length` is exactly `t - 1`, it doesnâ€™t add any cost, which is correct.
     - If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, the adjustment should be calculated correctly as `length - (t + 1)`.
     
   - The program does not cost a length adjustment from `t - 1` or `t + 1` to `t`, which may lead to incorrect calculation of costs in certain cases.

3. **Counter-example**:
   - Consider the test input where no cost adjustment is needed:
     ```
     n = 3
     a = [2, 3, 4]
     ```
     In this case, `t` could be 3. The program would calculate as follows:
     - For `t = 3`, the lengths 2 (cost = 1), 3 (cost = 0), and 4 (cost = 1) give a total cost of `2`. 
     
     However, if we consider:
     ```
     n = 3
     a = [1, 100, 99]
     ```
     The optimal selection of `t` would be `t = 100`. Here, we are forced to move `1` (cost = 99) and `99` (cost = 1), leading to a total cost of `100`. Yet the algorithm may miscalculate other `t`, leading to costs not aligning with what should be optimal depending on values across `(t-1, t+1)` boundaries.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The algorithm does have cases where it can miscalculate the minimum adjustment cost. 

Thus, the final verdict on correctness is:
Correctness: **False**.
