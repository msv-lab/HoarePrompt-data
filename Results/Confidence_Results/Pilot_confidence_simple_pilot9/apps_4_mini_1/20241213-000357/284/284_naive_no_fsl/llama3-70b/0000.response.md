To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program closely.

The problem asks to find a value of `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3) such that for a given integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the expression `n·m + 1` results in a non-prime number.

### Program Breakdown:
1. The input number `n` is read.
2. A loop runs `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. The program checks if `n * m + 1` is not a prime number using the function `func_1`.
4. If it finds an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, it prints that `m` and breaks the loop.
5. The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime by returning `False` for numbers less than 2, and for others, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of that number.

### Issues:
1. **Function Placement**: The `func_1` function is defined after its call. In Python, this would not work as the function must be defined before use. It will raise a `NameError`.
2. **Prime Check Logic**: The logic to check for primes is correct, but if the function isn't defined correctly before its use, it will not execute as intended.
3. The loop will run until it finds the first `m` that meets the condition. There is no guarantee it will complete the loop successfully when `func_1` is not available.

### Test Cases:
Even if we ignore the NameError for a moment and consider the logic without that issue:

- For example, if `n = 3`, we get `3 * 1 + 1 = 4`, which is non-prime. The output would be `1`.
- If `n = 1`, `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime, would not output). We continue until `m=3`, and find `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (output `3` would then be valid).

However, due to the issue described in **Issues** section, the program cannot execute correctly. 

### Conclusion:
The function placement would cause the code to break during execution due to the `NameError`, and it wouldn’t be able to produce an output as expected in the presence of that error. As such:

Correctness: **False** 

The program needs to ensure that function definitions preceed their calls to be considered as correctly functioning.
