To determine if the provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, we will analyze its functionality and check for edge cases.

Here is the overview of the program logic:

1. Read the dimensions of the monitor and the state of each pixel (black or white).
2. Collect the coordinates of all white pixels ('w').
3. Determine the minimum and maximum coordinates (both x and y) of these white pixels to find the boundaries of the square that can encompass all white pixels.
4. Calculate the size of the frame required to cover the white pixels.
5. If the size of the frame exceeds the dimensions of the monitor, it correctly outputs -1.
6. Then, it attempts to draw the frame on the monitor based on the minimum and maximum coordinates found.

Now let's check for potential edge cases:

1. **Case with Non-rectangular White Area:**
   - If the white pixels are scattered such that they do not form a rectangular shape (e.g., a single pixel surrounded by several empty spaces), the program does not consider the possibility of not being able to form a valid frame. For example:
   ```
   Input:
   3 3
   ...
   .w.
   ...
   Output should be:
   -1
   ```
   In this case, the larger bounding box would not be able to form a valid frame according to the problem's definition.

Therefore, the program fails to account for non-rectangular configurations of white pixels, and thus it does not cover all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for situations where the white pixels do not form a valid frame due to irregular positioning, leading to incorrect output in such scenarios.
