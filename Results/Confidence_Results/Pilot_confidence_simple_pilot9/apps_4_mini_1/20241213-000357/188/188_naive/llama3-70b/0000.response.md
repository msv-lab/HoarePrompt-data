To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let us analyze the code step by step:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program first reads an integer `n`, which is the number of cards, guaranteed to be even (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
    - It then reads `n` integers which represent the numbers on the cards.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
    - It uses a dictionary `d` to count how many times each number appears on the cards.

3. **Finding Two Distinct Integers**:
    - The program checks for two distinct integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times in total so that Petya and Vasya can choose them.
    - It initializes two variables `a1` and `a2` to keep track of the two integers.
    - A count `c` is used to control how many valid integers have been found.

4. **Output**:
    - If two integers are found that each occur `n // 2` times, it prints “YES” followed by the integers. Otherwise, it prints “NO”.

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Case with All Cards Same**: If the input consists of the same number, for example:
    ```
    2
    5
    5
    ```
   The output should be "NO", which is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Case with More than Two Distinct Integers**: If we have more than two distinct integers but none occurs `n // 2` times. For example:
    ```
    4
    1
    1
    2
    2
    ```
   The program correctly outputs "NO" since there is no pair that has exactly `n // 2 = 2` occurrences.

3. **Cases with exact distributions**: 
    - For an input that allows for a fair game like:
    ```
    4
    3
    3
    6
    6
    ```
   The program correctly identifies that both integers 3 and 6 occur 2 times and will output "YES" followed by the two integers.

4. **Case with Invalid Distribution**: Consider:
    ```
    6
    1
    1
    1
    2
    2
    2
    ```
   This should output "NO" since no integer occurs `n / 2` times which is also handled correctly by the program.

### Conclusion:
The current program logic checks for the requirement that two distinct integers must be found which each occur exactly half the number of cards. However, it misses cases where there could be valid distributions that satisfy the requirement but are not accounted for correctly. 

For example, consider the case where there are two distinct numbers, but not both candidates meet the `n // 2` criterion.

### Potential Failure Case:
Input:
```
4
5
5
5
10
```
In this case, the expected output should be "NO", but it might print "NO" depending on the condition checks made.

Correctness: **False**.
