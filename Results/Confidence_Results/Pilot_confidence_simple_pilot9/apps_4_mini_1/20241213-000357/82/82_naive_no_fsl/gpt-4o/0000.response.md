To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements
The task is to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) yielding the same LCM, we should choose the smallest \( k \).

### Program Analysis
Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The program uses a helper function `func_1` to compute the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: Another function `func_2` calculates the LCM based on the GCD.
3. **Main Logic in func_3**:
   - If \( a \) is equal to \( b \), it returns \( 0 \) immediately, as \( k = 0 \) is valid in this case.
   - It calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
   - Then, it checks all divisors of this difference up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) to find candidate values for \( k \).
   - For each divisor, it computes potential new values for \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) which are rounded up to the nearest multiple of the candidate divisor.
   - It calculates the LCM of these adjusted values and checks if this is the minimum found so far.
   - It updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding \( k \).

### Test Cases
1. **Case with Equal Input**:
   - Input: `6 6`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly returns `0`.

2. **General Test Case**:
   - Input: `6 10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program in fact finds `k = 2`, as the LCM of `8` and `12` (the values of `a+k` and `b+k`) is minimized.

3. **When LCM is Already Minimized without Increment**:
   - Input: `5 10`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The LCM of `5` and `10` is already `10`, which is minimal.

4. **Multiple Divisors**:
   - Input: `21 31`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - The program will find that `k=9` provides the minimal LCM by checking divisors, as expected.

### Edge Cases
Since the program checks divisors up to the square root of the difference, it may miss some potential values of \( k \) especially large \( k \). Testing with:
- Input: `30 35` (the difference is `5`).
- The expected output should be `0`, as LCM of `30` and `35` is minimized there.

### Identified Issue
The way `func_3` computes new \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) might miss values when \( k \) is larger than the candidates tested which implies that in specific scenarios with large disparities between \( a \) and \( b \) the program does not check all potential \( k \) correctly.

### Conclusion
The program's logic attempts to cover the core requirements, but potentially misses optimal \( k \) values during its divisor-based calculation approach. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
