To determine the correctness of the given program with the provided problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and compare it with the expected behavior described in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires us to output the number of standing spectators at a given time `t`, based on the rules of the Mexican wave.

- When `t` = 1 to `k`, the number of standing spectators increases from 1 to `k`.
- From `t` = `k + 1` to `n`, the number of standing spectators stays at `k`.
- When `t` = `n + 1` to `n + k`, the number of standing spectators decreases from `k` to 0.

### Given Program Logic:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

### Logic Analysis:
1. If `t <= n`:
   - The program prints `min(t, k)`, which correctly accounts for the first `k` time steps where the number of standing spectators increases up to `k`.
   
2. If `t > n`:
   - The program prints `k - (t - n) % k`.
   - This is intended to calculate how many spectators are still standing after `k` spectators have sat down.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- We should check the boundary between the time when spectators start sitting (`n`) and when they stop (`n + k`).
- Consider the complete cycle of the spectators sitting and standing.

#### Test Cases:
1. If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 10` (during the stable period):
    - Correct output should be `5`.
    - `func()` outputs `min(10, 5)` which gives `5`. (Correct)

2. If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 11` (the first spectator sits down):
    - Correct output should be `4`.
    - The program calculates `k - (11 - 10) % 5` = `5 - 1 = 4`. (Correct)

3. If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12` (the second spectator sits down):
    - Correct output should be `3`.
    - The program calculates `k - (12 - 10) % 5` = `5 - 2 = 3`. (Correct)

4. If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 15` (all spectators sit down):
    - Correct output should be `0`.
    - The program calculates `k - (15 - 10) % 5` = `5 - 0 = 5`, which is incorrect since all spectators should be sitting down. 

### Conclusion:
Since there exists at least one input case where the output does not match the expected result as described in the problem, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**. 

The case where `t = 15` produces an incorrect result shows that the program does not correctly handle the transition from standing to sitting spectators for all possible `t` values.
