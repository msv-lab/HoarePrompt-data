To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the behavior of the program in different scenarios.

The function receives three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` as input. The logic used in the program determines the number of standing spectators at time `t` based on the following conditions:

1. If `t <= k`, it prints `t`, which is correct since all spectators from 1 to `t` would be standing at that time.
2. If `t <= n`, it prints `k`, which is also correct because all `k` spectators would still be standing as the wave has not yet reached its maximum length of standing spectators.
3. If `t > n`, it prints `n + k - t`. The reasoning for this part is that at time `t > n`, spectators start sitting down, and the number of standing spectators decreases. The actual formula used is correct because:
   - At time `n`, all `k` spectators are still standing.
   - After time `n`, one spectator starts sitting down for every subsequent second.

Now letâ€™s ascertain the edge cases:

- For `t` values between `1` and `k`, the output matches the number of standing spectators.
- For `t` values equal to `n`, the output is `k`, still representing all the standing spectators before any starts sitting.
- For `t` values between `n + 1` and `n + k`, the formula `n + k - t` will gradually decrease correctly as the spectators sit down.

Let's analyze specific examples:
- If `n = 10, k = 5, t = 3`: The output is `3`, which is correct.
- If `n = 10, k = 5, t = 7`: The output is `5`, which is correct.
- If `n = 10, k = 5, t = 12`: The output is `3`, which is correct.

Now considering the upper limits:
- For instance, if `n = 10, k = 10, t = 11`, the output must be `9` as the 1st spectator sits down (correct).
- For `t = 15`, it outputs `0` as expected when all spectators are seated.

The program follows the described wave correctly without missing any edge cases or making erroneous calculations based on the transitions of standing and sitting spectators.

Conclusively, the program covers all potential cases as outlined in the description.

Correctness: **True**
