The given program attempts to determine if it's possible for Mishka to select moments in time to switch on three garlands so that at least one garland is lit during every second following the maximum of the chosen moments. It does this by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The order of the statements is problematic. The `func_1` function (used to calculate the greatest common divisor, GCD) should be defined before it is called.
   
2. The logic for determining if it prints "YES" or "NO" based on LCM is not aligned with the requirements of the problem. The condition implies a misunderstanding of what is needed to ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second after `max(x1, x2, x3)`. 

In particular, for garlands to cover all seconds after the maximum time `x1, x2, x3`, their periodicities must be carefully aligned. The current approach does not capture the essence of the problem correctly. 

For example, with the input `2, 2, 3`, the program may return "YES", but that does not guarantee that every second after the maximum `x1, x2, x3` will be covered, as overlaps must also be considered.

A simple counterexample to validate the approach would be:
- Input: `4 2 3`
- The right choice of seconds would be impossible, as there would be gaps at certain seconds after any choice.

The problem is not merely a calculation of LCM to ensure divisibility conditions on the intervals; better synchronization and configuration options need to be evaluated.

Therefore, upon analysis, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program logic fails to correctly address the problem constraints as per the provided description, and there are potential cases where the output does not fulfill the requirement of having at least one garland lit every subsequent second.
