Correctness: **False**

The logic used in the program is flawed. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals of the garlands and checks if they are divisible by each timing. However, simply being LCM divisible does not guarantee that there will be coverage of every second after the maximum of the starting times.

To illustrate a case where this program fails, consider the inputs `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 4`, `k3 = 4`. The LCM of three identical values (4) is also 4. According to the condition, since 4 is divisible by k1, k2, and k3, it would incorrectly output `YES`. However, there are times (from 5 seconds onward) when no garland will be lit at all if they are all started at the same time (such as at 1 second).

Thus the program does not correctly account for the problem's requirement that at least one garland must be lit at all times after the starting points, leading to an incorrect conclusion in multiple scenarios.
