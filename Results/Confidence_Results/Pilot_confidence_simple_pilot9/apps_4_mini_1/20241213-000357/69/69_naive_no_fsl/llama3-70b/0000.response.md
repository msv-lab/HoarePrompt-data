Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the desired final position `(x, y)` is unreachable due to insufficient movements in one or more directions. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
UUUUU
1 1
```
In this case, the robot has only moved up and thus cannot reach the target position `(1, 1)` which requires one rightward movement. The program will calculate `dx` and `dy` as `1` and `1` respectively, and incorrectly print `0` since there seem to be no further changes needed to achieve the coordinates, despite the point being unreachable with the current operations.

The correct behavior should be to return `-1` because it is impossible to reach `(1, 1)` from `(0, 0)` only moving upward with the given sequence.

This demonstrates that the logic for determining if a destination is reachable is flawed, supporting that the program is incorrect.
