To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we will analyze how the program processes the operations and how it determines the required changes to reach the target coordinates.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of operations `n`, the operations themselves as a string, and the target coordinates `(x, y)`.

2. **Initial Position Calculation**:
   - It calculates the final position `(ux, uy)` after executing all operations, where:
     - `U` increases `uy`
     - `D` decreases `uy`
     - `R` increases `ux`
     - `L` decreases `ux`

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The variable `dx` is calculated as the difference between final `ux` and target `x`.
   - The variable `dy` is calculated as the difference between final `uy` and target `y`.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, it prints `-1` because it indicates that the robot cannot reach the target as it would need to perform additional moves beyond what is possible.

5. **Change Calculation**:
   - The final loop checks each operation:
     - If a move can help reduce the current difference (either `dx` or `dy`), it reduces that difference.
     - If the move does not contribute to reaching the target, it increments the `res` counter, which counts how many operations need to be changed.

### Potential Issues:
- **Feasibility Condition**: The program only checks if `dx` and `dy` are both non-negative. However, it does not account for cases where the robot has the capacity to reach the target but just needs a different sequence to do so. For example, if there are excess moves in one direction, they might not be convertible into the moves needed to reach `(x, y)`.

- **Incorrect Counting of Changes**: The method to calculate how many operations need to be changed (`res`) does not properly track the minimum length of the changed subsegment. The logic should be updated to track the specific indices of the operations that need to be changed.

### Counter Example:
Let's consider a test case:
- Case:
  ```
  Input:
  5
  RURUU
  -2 3
  ```
  - The robot currently moves to `(1, 3)` after executing `RURUU`.
  - The needed direction changes are to replace `RR` or `RU` with `LUL` or some combination to reach `(x, y)`. However, the program assesses the possibility based on incorrect conditions and won't correctly count the needed length of changes, therefore potentially resulting in incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
Given these observations, I can confirm that there are cases where the current logic does not accurately calculate the required subsequence of operations, meaning the program fails to meet the specification. 

Correctness: **False**.
