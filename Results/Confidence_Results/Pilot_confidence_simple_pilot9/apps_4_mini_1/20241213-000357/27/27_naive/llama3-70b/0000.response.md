Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly handle the case where the maximum value occurs for multiple expressions. According to the problem description, if there are multiple maximums, the program should return the one that comes first in the order specified. However, the line `print(b[a.index(max(a))])` returns only the first occurrence of the maximum value and does not ensure that it is the earliest in terms of the input order. 

For example, if the inputs are `2.0 2.0 2.0`, all computed expressions will equal 8.0. The order of expressions is such that it should return `x^y^z` (1st) as it's the first one, which the program does. However, if the inputs are given as `2.1 1.6 1.6`, both `x^y^z` and `y^x^z` may be maximized, and if `y^x^z` happens to be computed first or last, the program must ensure that it selects the first one in the order list. 

Thus, I can identify cases (like equal input values) where the program might not return the correct output as specified by the problem, leading to an incorrect result.
