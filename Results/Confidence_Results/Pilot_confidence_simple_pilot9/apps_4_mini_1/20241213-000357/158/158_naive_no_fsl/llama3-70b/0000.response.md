Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the situation where Nikolay has fewer fruits available than the required amounts for the compote according to the specified ratio. Specifically, the requirement is to use exact amounts of fruits in the ratio of 1 lemon: 2 apples: 4 pears.

For example, consider the following test case which will demonstrate the flaw:

Input:
```
1
1
0
```

According to the recipe, to use 1 lemon, Nikolay would need 2 apples and 4 pears. However, in this test case, he has:
- 1 lemon
- 1 apple
- 0 pears

Since he needs 4 pears and has none, he cannot make the compote at all. The expected output is `0`, as he cannot produce any valid combination of fruits that conforms to the recipe.

However, with the current program logic, it would evaluate:
- `min_lemon = min(1, 1 // 2, 0 // 4)`, which results in `min_lemon = min(1, 0, 0)`, giving `min_lemon` as `0`.
- The output would then be `0 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4`, resulting in `0`, which is correct for this case.

This case doesn't lead to incorrect output, but it shows that the reasoning could be misleading when interpreting ratios without enough fruits.

Upon further inspection, the program correctly computes valid outputs for all provided test cases but does not take into account the scenario where fruits are available but do not meet the minimum required to make even a single complete set of the compote. Thus, it still computes correctly for the maximum number based on the available fruits.

However, let's examine the following edge case:

Input:
```
1
2
3
```
Here, the required ratio for at least one lemon is 2 apples and 4 pears, which Nikolay does not have. Thus the expected output is `0`, which the program also handles correctly.

Now, analyzing it further, the case correctly handles situations where the input can yield fruits that follow the 1:2:4 ratio and returns `0` if insufficient fruits are given, leading to no edge cases that lead to incorrect outputs based on available combinatorial logic. 

However, there's still an issue when considering the total output where minor miscalculations could happen in understanding the underlying logic of `0`, which could be confused without strict outputs from fruits and respective exits on count.

Correctness: **True**

The program outputs the correct maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make compote based on the provided input values of lemons, apples, and pears. Thus, upon further review and validations through logical inputs, the program adheres to expected output behavior and produces valid outputs as described in provided test cases across the problem landscape.
