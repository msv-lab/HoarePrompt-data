To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function systematically.

The task is to determine the maximum possible value of mex of an array after allowing any number of operations where you can decrease the values in the array. The mex of an array is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in that array.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads `n` and an array of integers.
   
2. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - The program sorts the array, which is a necessary step for the logic that follows. This helps check for the smallest missing positive integer efficiently.

3. **Calculating MEX**:
   - The variable `mex` starts at 1. The loop iterates through each number in the sorted array, checking:
     - If the current number equals `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1 (indicating that we've found this integer in the array).
     - If the current number is greater than `mex`, it breaks the loop. This is because any subsequent numbers will also be greater than `mex` due to sorting, and we can stop checking further.

### Potential Cases to Consider
To determine correctness, we need to find if there are any cases where this logic doesn't find the correct mex.

- **Case**: An array consisting entirely of the same number larger than 1 (e.g., `2, 2, 2, 2, 2`).
  - For this array, the mex is `1` since `1` is not present and cannot be achieved by any operation since all numbers are `2`.

- **Another Case**: Arrays with gaps in values.
  - For instance, `1, 2, 4`. The expected mex is `3`. The program will correctly compute this since it finds `1` and `2`, and on hitting `4`, it will stop and return `3`.

- **Edge Cases**: Minimum input and large bounds.
  - For an input of `1` (number of elements) and `1` as the array element, the provided code should correctly return `2` as the mex.

### Conclusion
The implementation does indeed compute the maximum possible mex correctly. The logic ensures that any available number can be achieved by reducing larger numbers appropriately. It also handles edge cases effectively.

Thus, I do not find any cases where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program follows the logic of calculating the mex after allowing the right transformations on the input array, thus yielding the correct outputs for the specified problem description.
