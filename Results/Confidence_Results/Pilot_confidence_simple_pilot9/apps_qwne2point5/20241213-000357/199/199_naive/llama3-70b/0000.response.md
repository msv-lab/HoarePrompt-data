Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square. The nested loops iterate over possible values of `a` and `b`, ensuring that `a` and `b` are distinct and their sum multiplied by 2 equals `n`. This ensures that the four parts can form a rectangle but not a square. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and examples provided.
