Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to buy a certain number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars such that the total cost is exactly `n` burles. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Iterative Approach**: The program iterates through possible values of `x` (number of bottles of Ber-Cola), from `0` to `n // a`.
2. **Check Feasibility**: For each value of `x`, it checks if `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`. If it is, it calculates `y` (number of Bars bars) and prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y`.
3. **Return Early**: Once a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, the function returns immediately, ensuring no redundant checks are performed after a solution is found.

Given these steps, the program handles all potential cases correctly. It ensures that if there exists any combination of `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`, it will find and print this combination. If no such combination exists, it will print "NO".

Since the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles all possible inputs as specified, it meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
