Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to buy some number of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly `n` burles. It iterates through possible values of `x` (number of bottles of Ber-Cola) from `0` to `n // a` and calculates the corresponding `y` (number of Bars bars) as `(n - x * a) // b`. If `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and exits the loop. If no such pair `(x, y)` is found, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers and checks all possible combinations to see if they sum up to `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
