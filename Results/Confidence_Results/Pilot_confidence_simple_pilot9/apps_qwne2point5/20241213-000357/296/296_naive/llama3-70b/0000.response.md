Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to generate a sequence of fractions that sum up to \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\) for some values of \(n\). For instance, consider \(n = 4\):

- According to the problem, we need to find fractions \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\).
- The program always prints `YES` and constructs a sequence of 2 fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\), which sums to \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}\), not \(\frac{3}{4}\).

Since the program does not correctly generate the required sequence for \(n = 4\) (or similar cases where the constructed fractions do not sum to \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\)), it is incorrect.
