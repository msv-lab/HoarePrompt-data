Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a greedy approach by placing the fishes in cells with the highest coverage, but it has a logical error in the `coverage` function. Specifically, the calculation of coverage does not account for the correct number of cells covered by the scoop-net when the scoop-net is placed partially outside the pond.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Input**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, `k = 3`
- **Expected Output**: The maximum expected number of caught fishes should be 2.0000000000, as explained in Example 1.

However, the provided program will place the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3) as mentioned in the example, which is correct. But if we analyze the coverage calculation for these positions:

- For cell (2, 1):
  - Coverage: `(min(2 + 1, 3 - 2 + 1) - max(2 - 2 + 1 - 1, 0)) * (min(1 + 1, 3 - 2 + 1) - max(1 - 2 + 1 - 1, 0)) = (2 - 0) * (1 - 0) = 2`
- For cell (2, 2):
  - Coverage: `(min(2 + 1, 3 - 2 + 1) - max(2 - 2 + 1 - 1, 0)) * (min(2 + 1, 3 - 2 + 1) - max(2 - 2 + 1 - 1, 0)) = (2 - 0) * (2 - 0) = 4`
- For cell (2, 3):
  - Coverage: `(min(2 + 1, 3 - 2 + 1) - max(2 - 2 + 1 - 1, 0)) * (min(3 + 1, 3 - 2 + 1) - max(3 - 2 + 1 - 1, 0)) = (2 - 0) * (2 - 0) = 4`

These calculations are incorrect because the scoop-net can cover fewer than the calculated number of cells when placed near the edges of the pond.

A correct solution would involve calculating the actual number of cells covered by the scoop-net for each position and ensuring that the placement of fishes maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. The provided program does not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
