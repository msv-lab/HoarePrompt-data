Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after performing the given operations. 

- The program counts the number of operations that remove stones (`minus_count`) and the number of operations that add stones (`plus_count`).
- If the number of removal operations (`minus_count`) is greater than the addition operations (`plus_count`), the pile can become empty, and the result is `0`.
- Otherwise, the minimal possible number of stones in the pile is the difference between the addition operations and the removal operations (`plus_count - minus_count`).

This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
