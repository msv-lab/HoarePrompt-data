Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the golden system comparison. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a golden system number but does not handle the full comparison logic required. It only returns the decimal value of the input string, which is insufficient to determine which of the two numbers is larger.

For example, consider the inputs "1000" and "0111":
- "1000" in golden system equals approximately \(q^3 \approx 4.236\).
- "0111" in golden system equals approximately \(q^2 + q + 1 \approx 3.236\).

However, the provided program will incorrectly compare these values by simply calculating their decimal equivalents and printing the result, which will print ">". This is incorrect because "0111" is actually greater than "1000" in the golden system.

The program needs to implement a full comparison logic that respects the properties of the golden system, such as comparing the coefficients of the powers of \(q\) in descending order.
