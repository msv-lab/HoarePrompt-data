Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to find the optimal position for the heat source by iterating over a grid of integer coordinates from -1000 to 1000. However, this approach has several issues:

1. **Precision**: The program uses integer coordinates, which means it cannot consider real number positions accurately. This can lead to suboptimal solutions since the actual optimal position might lie between two integer points.

2. **Search Space**: The grid search space (-1000 to 1000) is quite coarse. Given the constraints (coordinates ranging from -1000 to 1000), there could be many more optimal positions that are not checked due to the coarseness of the grid.

To illustrate the issue, consider the sample input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The optimal position, as mentioned in the output, is \((-0.2, 0)\). However, this position is not covered by the grid search because \(-0.2\) is not an integer. As a result, the program might miss the true optimal solution.

Therefore, the program does not guarantee finding the minimum time required to grill \(K\) or more pieces of meat, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
