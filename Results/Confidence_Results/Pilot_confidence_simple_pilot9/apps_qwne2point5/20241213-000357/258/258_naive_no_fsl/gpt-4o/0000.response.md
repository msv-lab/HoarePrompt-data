Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program seems to have an issue with how it calculates the optimal position for the heat source. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to check if a given time `T` allows `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready, but it does not correctly calculate the optimal time `T`. Instead, it appears to be checking if a line segment between two points can cover `K` or more pieces of meat, which is not the intended approach.

The problem requires finding the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready. However, the current implementation in `func_1` does not handle this correctly. It checks if a line segment between two points can cover `K` or more pieces of meat, which is not relevant to the problem statement.

To verify this, consider the sample input provided:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The correct output is 2.4 seconds, as calculated when the heat source is placed at (-0.2, 0). However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
