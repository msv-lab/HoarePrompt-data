Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **LCM Calculation**: The `func_2` function calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Main Logic**: The `func_3` function:
   - Checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, returning 0 immediately if they are.
   - Computes the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the difference.
   - For each candidate \( k \), it calculates the new values \( a' \) and \( b' \) such that \( a' = (a + k - 1) / k \times k \) and similarly for \( b' \).
   - Calculates the LCM for these new values and updates the minimum LCM and corresponding \( k \) if a smaller LCM is found.

This approach ensures that all potential values of \( k \) are checked efficiently, and the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM is returned. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this implementation handles all edge cases and examples correctly.
