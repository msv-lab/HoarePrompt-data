Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines Lara's current position after she has moved k times according to the specified path. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Movement Down**: Lara starts from cell (1, 1) and moves down to cell (n, 1). This covers `n-1` steps.
2. **Snake Movement**: After reaching (n, 1), she starts moving in a snake fashion, first to the right and then up.

The program handles these cases as follows:
- If `k < n - 1`, it means Lara is still in the initial downward movement phase. The position is simply `(k + 1, 1)`.
- For movements beyond `n - 1`, the program calculates the number of complete rows moved in the snake pattern and the remaining steps within the current row.

The logic for determining the row and column after accounting for the full rows and remaining steps is sound. The program correctly handles both even and odd numbered full rows, ensuring the calculations match the described path.

Since the program accurately computes the position for all given test cases and potential edge cases, it meets the problem description for every potential case.
