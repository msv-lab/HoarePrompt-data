Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to store the coordinates of each sofa and the count values.
2. **Sofa Comparison Function (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa by comparing the coordinates.
3. **Loop Through Sofas**: The program iterates through each sofa and uses the `func_1` function to determine if the current sofa matches the required counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). If a match is found, it prints the index of the sofa (adjusted by +1 to convert from 0-based indexing to 1-based indexing) and breaks out of the loop.
4. **Handling No Match**: If no matching sofa is found after checking all the sofas, the program correctly prints `-1`.

Given the logic and implementation, the program handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
