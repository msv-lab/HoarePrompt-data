Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the graph already contains multiple cycles. According to the problem description, the program should output "YES" if it's possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, the current implementation only checks for cycles and does not attempt to remove edges to check if the graph becomes acyclic after removal.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 6
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
1 3
2 4
```

In this case, the graph contains multiple cycles (e.g., \(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 1\)). The program will detect the cycle but will not attempt to remove any edges to see if the graph can become acyclic by removing just one edge. Therefore, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not attempt to remove edges and check the resulting graph.

To fix this, the program needs to implement an additional step to check if the graph remains cyclic after attempting to remove each edge.
