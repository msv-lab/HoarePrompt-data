Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution for this problem. It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn in `j` minutes considering the first `i` subtasks. The program iterates over the subtasks and updates the DP table accordingly, ensuring that it considers both the scenario of solving additional subtasks and the bonus point for completing a task.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The DP approach ensures that the program evaluates all possible ways to maximize points within the given time limit, including the bonus points for completing tasks.

Since no specific edge cases or examples were found where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
