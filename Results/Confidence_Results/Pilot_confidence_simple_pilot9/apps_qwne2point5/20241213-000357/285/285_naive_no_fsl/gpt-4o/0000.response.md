Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than the smallest cost (1234). Specifically, if `n < 1234`, the program will not correctly determine that it's impossible to spend all coins since it starts iterating from 0 houses. For example, if `n = 1233`, the program will immediately return 'NO' without checking other combinations, which is incorrect because it's possible to spend all coins using only computers (1233 / 1234 = 1 with remainder 0).

To fix this, you should add a condition at the beginning of the function to check if `n` is less than the smallest cost before starting the nested loops.
