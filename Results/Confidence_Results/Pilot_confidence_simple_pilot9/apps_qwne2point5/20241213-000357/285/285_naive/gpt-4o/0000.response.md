Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins using only houses, cars, and computers. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the initial game-coin score `n`.
2. **Nested Loops**: It uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (the number of houses, cars, and computers, respectively).
3. **Cost Calculation**: For each combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it calculates the remaining amount after purchasing `a` houses and `b` cars.
4. **Check Remainder**: If the remaining amount is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`), it means the combination is valid, and it returns "YES".
5. **Return "NO"**: If no valid combination is found, it returns "NO".

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There is no scenario where the program would fail to meet the requirements as described.
