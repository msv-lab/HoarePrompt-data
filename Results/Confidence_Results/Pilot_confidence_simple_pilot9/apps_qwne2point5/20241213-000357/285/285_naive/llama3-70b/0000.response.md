Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The program iterates over possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if the equation \(a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n\) holds true for any combination of non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). 

The outer loop runs through possible values of \(a\) (number of houses), the middle loop runs through possible values of \(b\) (number of cars) given the remaining coins after buying houses, and the innermost calculation determines the value of \(c\) (number of computers) given the remaining coins after buying houses and cars. If a valid combination is found, the program prints "YES" and exits. If no valid combination is found after all iterations, it prints "NO".

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
