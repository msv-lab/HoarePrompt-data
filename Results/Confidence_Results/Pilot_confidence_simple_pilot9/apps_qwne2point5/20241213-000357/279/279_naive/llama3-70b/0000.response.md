Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed for each skewer to visit all 2n placements. Specifically, the program simply counts the number of positions where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of `0`s in the sequence `b`. However, this approach does not account for the cyclic nature of the movements and reversals required to ensure each skewer visits all positions.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
1 0 0 0
```
In this case, the permutation `p` is already a valid permutation (1-based index), and the sequence `b` does not require any changes since reversing the skewers in their current state does not help achieve the goal. The program would incorrectly output `1` because it counts the number of `0`s in `b`, but no changes are actually needed.

A correct solution would involve checking the cycle lengths in the permutation and ensuring that each skewer can visit all positions through appropriate reversals and reordering.
