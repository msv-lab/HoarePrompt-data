Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string. The logic in the program increments `ans` every time it encounters a different character from the previous one, which is not always optimal. For example, consider the input string "aaaaa":

- The program will output `ans = 4`, because it increments `ans` for each consecutive 'a', resulting in 4 operations.
- However, the correct answer should be `1` operation, as we can delete the entire substring "aaaaa" in one operation.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not handle all cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
