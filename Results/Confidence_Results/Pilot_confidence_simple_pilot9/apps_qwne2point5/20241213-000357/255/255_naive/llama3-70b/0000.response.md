Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string. The logic in the program increments `ans` whenever it encounters a different character than the previous one, which is not sufficient to handle all cases.

For example, consider the input `bbcc`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to delete the string would be to delete the substring `bb` first, and then delete `cc`, resulting in 2 operations. However, the current program would incorrectly count this as 3 operations because it increments `ans` for each different character encountered.

To fix this, a more complex logic is needed to group consecutive identical characters and then count the groups. Here's a possible corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and s[i] == s[start]:
            i += 1
        ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version iterates through the string and counts the groups of consecutive identical characters, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.
