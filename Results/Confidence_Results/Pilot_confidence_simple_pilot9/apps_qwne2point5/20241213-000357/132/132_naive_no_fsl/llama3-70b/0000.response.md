Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the total number of stones is the same in both visits and whether the two lists are sorted and equal. However, this logic is insufficient to determine if the transformations between the two states are possible under the given constraints.

Consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  2 3 9
  1 7 9
  ```

The program will check if the sums are equal and if the sorted lists are equal. In this case:
- Sum of `x` is `14` and sum of `y` is `17`, so the program will print "No" because the sums are not equal.

However, the correct answer should be "No" because it's not possible to transform the first state to the second state with the given operations (jury members taking or moving one stone).

The program fails to consider the possibility of redistributing stones between piles, which is allowed according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
