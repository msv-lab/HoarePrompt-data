Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Here's why:

1. **Counting Existing Nucleotides**: The program correctly counts the existing nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') and determines the difference from the average count required for each type of nucleotide.

2. **Replacing Question Marks**: The program iterates through the input string `s` and replaces each '?' with the appropriate nucleotide to achieve the required balance. It ensures that only one nucleotide is used per replacement, maintaining the balance across all types.

3. **Validation**: After replacing all '?', the program checks if any nucleotide count is still off. If so, it prints "==="; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

Since the program handles the constraints and requirements accurately without any logical flaws, it works correctly for all valid inputs described by the problem statement.
