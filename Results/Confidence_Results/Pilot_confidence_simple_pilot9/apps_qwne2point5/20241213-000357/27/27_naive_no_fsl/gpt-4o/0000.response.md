Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates all twelve possible expressions, compares them to find the maximum value, and prints the corresponding expression. The program handles all cases as required:

1. It reads three real numbers from the input with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
2. It evaluates all twelve possible expressions.
3. It determines the maximum value among these expressions.
4. It prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value, ensuring that the formatting matches the specified output format.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and produces the expected output for the given examples and any other valid inputs within the specified range, the correctness of the program is True.
