Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The core issue lies in how it calculates the number of valid pairs of shovels.

The program attempts to determine the maximum number of trailing nines (`max_9s`) in `n` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 and checking if the remainder is 0. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the conditions under which a pair of shovels would sum to a number ending in the maximum number of nines.

For example, consider the input `n = 50`. The program would calculate `max_9s` as 1 (since 50 is 5*10), but the correct calculation should determine that the maximum number of trailing nines is 2, because the pair (49, 50) sums to 99.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the highest power of 10 that fits within `n` and then determine the number of valid pairs based on that. The given implementation does not account for the specific conditions required to maximize the number of trailing nines, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
