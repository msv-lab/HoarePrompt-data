Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks if the sum of each pair of shovels ends with the maximum possible number of nines, but it does not handle the case where the maximum number of trailing nines is greater than one.

For example, consider `n = 50`. According to the problem description, the optimal pair would be shovels 49 and 50, whose total cost is 99, ending with two nines. However, the program will not correctly identify this pair because it only checks if the sum ends with a single nine. It does not account for the possibility of sums ending with more than one nine.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the maximum number of trailing nines for the sum and then check pairs to see if they match this condition. The current implementation only checks for sums ending with a single nine, which is insufficient for determining the maximum number of trailing nines.
