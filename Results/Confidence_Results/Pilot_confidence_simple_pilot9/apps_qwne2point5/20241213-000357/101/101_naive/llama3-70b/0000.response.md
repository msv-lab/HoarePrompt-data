Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the smallest square frame that contains all white pixels. Specifically, the logic for determining the boundaries of the smallest frame is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Frame Boundaries**: The program calculates the `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` positions using the positions of the white pixels. However, these values do not necessarily represent the smallest possible square frame that encloses all white pixels. For instance, if the white pixels form a vertical or horizontal line, the current logic will incorrectly expand the frame to include more pixels than necessary.

2. **Frame Size Calculation**: The calculation of `frame_size` as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` is overly simplistic and does not guarantee the smallest possible frame. It merely computes the dimensions of the bounding box, which may not be a square or may include unnecessary extra pixels.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the modified grid, changing black pixels within the calculated frame to `+` symbols. However, this approach does not account for cases where the smallest square frame might not perfectly align with the existing white pixels.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
.w.
...
.w.
```
- **Expected Output**: The smallest square frame that includes all white pixels is of size 1x1. Therefore, the output should be:
  ```
  .w.
  ...
  .w.
  ```
- **Actual Output**: The provided program would incorrectly expand the frame to include more pixels, resulting in an output like:
  ```
  ++++
  +...
  ++++
  ```

This counterexample shows that the program fails to correctly identify the smallest square frame and instead generates an unnecessarily large frame. Hence, the program is incorrect.
