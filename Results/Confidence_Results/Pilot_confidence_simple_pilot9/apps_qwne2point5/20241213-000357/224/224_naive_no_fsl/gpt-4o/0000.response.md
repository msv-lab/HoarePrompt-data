Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the function \( f(p) \) as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function \( f(p) \) is defined based on the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of the prefixes of the permutation \( p \), and the program does not calculate this correctly.

For instance, consider \( n = 6 \):

- For the permutation \([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\):
  - \( g_1 = \text{gcd}(1) = 1 \)
  - \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(1, 2) = 1 \)
  - \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(1, 2, 3) = 1 \)
  - \( g_4 = \text{gcd}(1, 2, 3, 4) = 1 \)
  - \( g_5 = \text{gcd}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 1 \)
  - \( g_6 = \text{gcd}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 1 \)
  
  So, \( f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) = 1 \).

- For the permutation \([2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]\):
  - \( g_1 = \text{gcd}(2) = 2 \)
  - \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(2, 4) = 2 \)
  - \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(2, 4, 6) = 2 \)
  - \( g_4 = \text{gcd}(2, 4, 6, 1) = 1 \)
  - \( g_5 = \text{gcd}(2, 4, 6, 1, 3) = 1 \)
  - \( g_6 = \text{gcd}(2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5) = 1 \)
  
  So, \( f([2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]) = 2 \).

However, the program only calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \), which is irrelevant to the problem. This means the program will not compute the correct value of \( f(p) \) or count the number of permutations with the maximum \( f(p) \).

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to implement the required logic for calculating \( f(p) \) and counting permutations with the maximum \( f(p) \).
