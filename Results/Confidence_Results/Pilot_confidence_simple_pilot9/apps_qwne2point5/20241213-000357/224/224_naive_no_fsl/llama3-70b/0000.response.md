Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the function `func_3` to count the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. The logic in `func_3` seems to be counting permutations based on a misunderstanding of how `f(p)` is calculated. Specifically, the current implementation of `func_3` does not accurately reflect the logic required to maximize the number of distinct GCD values in the prefix sums of the permutation.

To verify this, consider the following counterexample:

For `n = 4`, the maximum value of `f_max(4)` is 2. The correct permutations that achieve this are those where the GCD of the prefix sums is maximized, which involves careful placement of the numbers to ensure the GCDs are distinct. However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect count of permutations.

Since the program fails to correctly count the number of valid permutations for at least one value of `n`, the correctness is False.
