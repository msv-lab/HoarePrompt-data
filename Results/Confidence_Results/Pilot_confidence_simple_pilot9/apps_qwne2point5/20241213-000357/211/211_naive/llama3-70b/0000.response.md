Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the array contains zeros and the sum of elements from the start to the current index becomes zero before reaching the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
5
0 1 -1 2 -2
```

The program should split the array into `YES` with subarrays `[0], [1, -1, 2, -2]`, but the provided solution will incorrectly print `NO` because it checks if the total prefix sum is zero and prints `NO` without considering the requirement for each subarray to have a non-zero sum.
