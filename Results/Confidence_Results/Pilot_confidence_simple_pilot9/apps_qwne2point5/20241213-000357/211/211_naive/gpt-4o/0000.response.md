Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider arrays where no element is non-zero. For example, if the input array consists entirely of zeros, the program will incorrectly output "YES" and a split into two parts, which does not satisfy the requirement that each subarray's sum must be non-zero. 

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:
```
Input:
3
0 0 0

Output:
YES
2
1 2
3 3

Expected Output:
NO
```

In this case, since all elements are zero, no valid split exists that satisfies the condition of having a non-zero sum for each subarray. Therefore, the program should output "NO", but it outputs "YES" and a split, which is incorrect.
