Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `full_cycle_length`. In such cases, the program calculates the `remaining_questions` but does not properly account for these remaining questions within the current cycle. Specifically, the logic to increment `sergei_questions` based on the remaining questions is flawed. Let's consider an example:

### Example Case
Input:
```
2 2 2 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1 1 1
```

Actual Output:
```
1 0 1
```

In this case, the teacher asks two questions in a classroom with 2 rows and 2 columns. The full cycle length is `4`, but since `k` is `2`, we only need to consider the first two questions. The first question will be asked to the pupil in the first row and first column (Sergei), and the second question will also be asked to the same pupil. Therefore, the minimum, maximum, and count for Sergei should all be `1`.

However, the program incorrectly sets `min_questions` to `0` instead of `1` when calculating `sergei_questions`. This happens because the condition `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` is evaluated to `0` since `full_cycles` is `0` in this case. The correct approach would be to ensure that `sergei_questions` is incremented based on the remaining questions within the current cycle, which is not handled properly in the given implementation.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly account for the remaining questions within the current cycle, especially when `k` is less than `full_cycle_length`.
