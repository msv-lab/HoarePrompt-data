Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum possible value of the mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations. 

Consider the input:
```
5
2 2 2 2 2
```

The program sorts the array and iterates through it to find the mex. However, since all elements are 2, the program will set `mex` to 1 as soon as it encounters the first element, which is incorrect. The correct mex value in this case should be 3 because Alyona can decrease each element to any smaller positive integer, allowing for the values 1, 2, and 3 to be present without conflict.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where all elements are the same and ensure that the mex is correctly calculated as the smallest integer not present in the array after possible operations.
