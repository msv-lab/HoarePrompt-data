Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case correctly when `t` is greater than `n` but less than `n + k`. Specifically, the program does not account for the spectators sitting down after reaching `n`.

For example, consider the following input:
- Input: `10 5 12`

According to the problem description, at `t = 12`, the number of standing spectators should be `3` because the 10th spectator is standing and the 7th spectator has sat down. However, the program incorrectly outputs `5`:

```
At t = 12, the program output: 5
Expected output: 3
```

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly handle the transition period after all spectators have stood up and before they start sitting down again. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
