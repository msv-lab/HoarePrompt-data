Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraint that Limak can only move to the South if he is on the North Pole and can only move to the North if he is on the South Pole. Specifically, the program allows Limak to move to the North from the North Pole if the distance exceeds 20,000 kilometers, which violates the problem constraints. For example, if the input is:

```
5
20001 North
10000 East
3500 North
4444 West
4000 North
```

In this case, Limak moves 20001 kilometers to the North from the North Pole, which is invalid since the maximum distance he can travel from the North Pole is 20000 kilometers. The program would incorrectly accept this input as valid.
