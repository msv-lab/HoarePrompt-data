Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding \( m \) and breaks the loop.

Given the problem description and the examples, the program handles all cases correctly. For any \( n \), the program will eventually find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number within the specified range (1 to 1000). Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
