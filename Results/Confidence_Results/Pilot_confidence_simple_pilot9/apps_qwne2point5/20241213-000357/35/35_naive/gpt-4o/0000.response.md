Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` are such that no valid distribution exists. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the sum of the pieces (`a + b`) is less than the number of plates (`n`). In such cases, it is impossible to place at least one piece of cake on each plate, but the current implementation does not account for this and still attempts to find a valid distribution.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 1 1
```
Here, there are 3 plates and only 2 pieces of cake. According to the problem description, it is impossible to distribute the cakes such that each plate has at least one piece of cake. However, the program will still attempt to find a valid distribution and output a value, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should first check if the total number of pieces is at least equal to the number of plates before proceeding with the binary search. If the condition is not met, the program should immediately return -1 to indicate that no valid distribution is possible.
