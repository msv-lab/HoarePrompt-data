Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of divisors of `n`, which does not correctly determine the number of different weights of splits of `n`. 

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the input `8`:

- According to the problem description, the valid splits of `8` are `[4, 4]`, `[3, 3, 2]`, `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `[5, 2, 1]`, etc.
- The weights of these splits are `2`, `2`, `6`, `3`, respectively.
- Therefore, the number of different weights should be `4`.

However, the function `func_1` in the program counts the number of divisors of `n`, which is `4` for `n=8`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the different possible weights of the splits.

A correct solution would involve generating all possible splits and then determining the unique weights of those splits.
