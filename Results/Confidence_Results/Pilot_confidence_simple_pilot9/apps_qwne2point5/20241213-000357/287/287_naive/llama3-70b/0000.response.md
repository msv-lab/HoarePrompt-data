Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of divisors of `n` and uses this count to determine the number of different weights of splits of `n`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for all possible splits of `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 9`. According to the problem description, the possible weights of splits of `9` are:

- Weight 1: `[9]`
- Weight 2: `[4, 4, 1]`, `[3, 3, 3]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
- Weight 3: `[3, 3, 3]` (already counted)
- Weight 9: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

So, there are 5 different weights of splits of `9`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `4` because it only counts the divisors of `9` without considering all possible splits.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to generate all possible splits of `n` and calculate their weights, then count the distinct weights. The current implementation fails to do this.
