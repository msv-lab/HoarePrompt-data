Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to cook the compote according to the given ratio. The program calculates the minimum number of lemons (`a`) that can be used, and then determines the corresponding number of apples (`b // 2`) and pears (`c // 4`) that can be used. The sum of these values gives the maximum total number of fruits that can be used. This logic handles all the given examples and any other potential inputs within the specified range (1 to 1000 for `a`, `b`, and `c`). Therefore, the program is correct.
