Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input string is a palindrome. According to the problem description, if all substrings of a string are palindromes, the output should be `0`. However, the current implementation checks only a few substrings (`s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`) and does not cover all possible substrings of the input string.

For example, consider the input `mommom`. This string is a palindrome, and all its substrings are palindromes. According to the problem description, the output should be `0`, but the current program might not handle this case correctly since it does not check all substrings of the input string.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible substrings of the input string. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
s = input().strip()

max_length = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if not func_1(substring):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

This version of the program iterates over all possible substrings of the input string and finds the longest substring that is not a palindrome.
