Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program accurately determines the outcome of the votes based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. 

Here's why the program works:

- It first calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of upvotes and downvotes by considering the range of possible votes from the unknown voters.
- If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it means that Nauuo will definitely get more downvotes than upvotes, so the program prints '-'.
- If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it means that Nauuo will definitely get more upvotes than downvotes, so the program prints '+'.
- In all other cases, the outcome is uncertain because there are scenarios where the upvotes can be more, less, or equal to the downvotes, so the program prints '?'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases. For example, when there are no unknown voters (z = 0), the program correctly prints the outcome as either '+', '-', or '0' based on the number of upvotes and downvotes. 

When there are unknown voters, the program checks if the outcome is uncertain by considering the range of possible votes, and correctly prints '?' when the outcome is uncertain.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
