Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not correctly calculate the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. The issue lies in the calculation of the count variable and the condition used to populate the ans list.

In the given code, the count variable is incremented until n // 5 ** count >= m. However, this does not correctly calculate the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of n, which determines the number of trailing zeroes.

To correctly calculate the number of factors of 5, we need to sum up the quotients of n divided by powers of 5, i.e., n // 5 + n // 25 + n // 125 +... until the quotient becomes zero.

Moreover, the condition used to populate the ans list, n // 5 ** count < m, is also incorrect. It should be checking the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of n, not the value of n divided by a power of 5.

Here's a counterexample: if we input m = 1, the program should output 5 numbers: 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, because the factorials of these numbers have exactly 1 trailing zero. However, the provided code does not correctly calculate the number of trailing zeroes for these factorials.

A correct solution would involve calculating the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each number n, and checking if it equals m. If it does, we add n to the ans list.

Here is a correct version of the function:

```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    ans = []
    n = 1
    while True:
        factors_of_5 = 0
        temp_n = n
        while temp_n > 0:
            temp_n //= 5
            factors_of_5 += temp_n
        if factors_of_5 > m:
            break
        elif factors_of_5 == m:
            ans.append(n)
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
```

This function correctly calculates the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each number n and checks if it equals m. If it does, it adds n to the ans list. The function stops when the number of factors of 5 exceeds m, because we know that the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of n will only increase as n increases.
