Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program attempts to determine if a given sequence of digits can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. However, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

The program only checks if the total sum of the digits can be divided into two equal parts, and then it tries to divide the sequence into segments with this target sum. This approach is insufficient because it does not consider all possible segment lengths and sums.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the sequence can be divided into segments with a sum that is not equal to half of the total sum. For example, the sequence "350178" can be divided into segments with sums 8 (3+5+0, 1+7, 8), but the program would not detect this because it only checks for a sum equal to half of the total sum (which is 8+8+8 = 24 / 2 = 12 in this case).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should try all possible segment lengths and sums, not just the sum equal to half of the total sum. 

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to correctly solve the problem:
```python
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum):
        segments = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        valid = True
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
            elif curr_sum > target_sum:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid and curr_sum == 0 and segments >= 2:
            return True
    return False
```
This modified program tries all possible target sums and checks if the sequence can be divided into segments with this sum. If it finds a valid division with at least two segments, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
