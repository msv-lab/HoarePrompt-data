Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not fully implement the problem description as it does not account for cases when the grasshopper jumps to the left. It also incorrectly handles cases when the jump size `k` is larger than the distance between the grasshopper and the target.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 3
..G..T
```
The grasshopper can jump from position 2 to position 5, but the code does not consider this possibility because it only checks jumps in the forward direction and with a step size of `k` starting from the grasshopper's initial position.

To correctly solve this problem, a more comprehensive approach would be needed, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible jump sequences from the grasshopper's initial position.

Here's a simplified example of how this could be implemented:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited = {G_pos}
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
            
        for jump in [k, -k]:
            new_pos = pos + jump
            
            if 0 <= new_pos < n and line[new_pos]!= '#' and new_pos not in visited:
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)
    
    print('NO')

func()
```
This code uses a queue to keep track of positions to visit and a set to keep track of visited positions. It iteratively checks all possible jumps from the current position and adds the new positions to the queue if they are within the line boundaries, not blocked by an obstacle, and not visited before. The algorithm stops when it finds the target position or when all reachable positions have been visited.
