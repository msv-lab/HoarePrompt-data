Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the file names are already in the desired format (i.e., integers from 1 to n), but there are files with the same type (either example or regular) that need to be moved to their correct positions.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1
2 1
3 0
4 0
5 0
```
The program will output:
```
5
move 1 1
move 2 2
move 3 3
move 4 4
move 5 5
```
However, this is incorrect because the file with name "3" is a regular test and should be moved to position 3, but the file with name "3" is already occupied by an example test.

A correct solution should handle such cases by temporarily moving the files to a different location, and then moving them to their correct positions. 

Another issue with the program is that it does not check if the file names are already integers from 1 to n before moving them. This can lead to incorrect results if the file names are already in the correct format.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to handle cases where the file names are already in the desired format, and to check if the file names are already integers from 1 to n before moving them. 

The program also does not handle the case when the file to be moved already exists. In this case, the program should first move the existing file to a temporary location and then move the file to be moved to its correct location. 

The program should be modified to handle all these cases correctly. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    temp_name = 'tmp'
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if os.path.exists(str(i)):
            os.rename(str(i), temp_name)
            script.append(f'move {i} {temp_name}')
        os.rename(file, str(i))
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        if os.path.exists(temp_name):
            os.rename(temp_name, str(i))
            script.append(f'move {temp_name} {i}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if os.path.exists(str(i)):
            os.rename(str(i), temp_name)
            script.append(f'move {i} {temp_name}')
        os.rename(file, str(i))
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        if os.path.exists(temp_name):
            os.rename(temp_name, str(i))
            script.append(f'move {temp_name} {i}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
```
This implementation uses a temporary file name to handle cases where the file to be moved already exists. It also checks if the file names are already integers from 1 to n before moving them. 

Note that this implementation assumes that the os module is available, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including renaming files. 

This implementation should correctly handle all cases, including cases where the file names are already in the desired format, and cases where the file to be moved already exists.
