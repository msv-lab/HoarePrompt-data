Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to rotate the image so that it is minimally deviated from vertical. 

The problem description states that the picture should be rotated only by an angle divisible by 90 degrees to minimize deviation from vertical. The program correctly normalizes the input angle to be within the range 0 to 360 degrees. However, it then calculates the turns as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, which is incorrect.

Let's consider the case where the input angle is -60 degrees. The normalized angle would be 300 degrees (since -60 % 360 = 300). The program then calculates the turns as `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 60 // 90 % 4 = 0`, which is incorrect because the actual minimum turns required is 3.

The correct approach would be to try all possible turns (0, 1, 2, or 3) and calculate the resulting deviation from vertical for each. The minimum deviation should be chosen, and the corresponding number of turns printed.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    deviations = []
    for turns in range(4):
        resulting_angle = (x + turns * 90) % 360
        if resulting_angle > 180:
            deviation = 360 - resulting_angle
        else:
            deviation = resulting_angle
        deviations.append(deviation)
    min_deviation_turns = deviations.index(min(deviations))
    print(min_deviation_turns)
```
This code correctly calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to rotate the image so that it is minimally deviated from vertical.
