Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function seems to correctly implement the logic required to satisfy the problem description. 

The function first checks if the number of friends (`M`) is greater than or equal to the number of coins Ivan doesn't have (`N - K + 1`) and also greater than or equal to the number of new coins Ivan must receive (`L`). 

If both conditions are met, it prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift one coin, and Ivan will still receive at least `L` new coins. 

If the conditions are not met, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy all the terms.

After analyzing the code, it seems to handle all possible cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles cases where Ivan already has all the coins, cases where Ivan has no coins, cases where the number of friends is less than the number of new coins required, and cases where the number of friends is greater than the number of coins Ivan doesn't have.

The code is also efficient, as it only requires a constant amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct, and it should work as expected for all possible inputs.
