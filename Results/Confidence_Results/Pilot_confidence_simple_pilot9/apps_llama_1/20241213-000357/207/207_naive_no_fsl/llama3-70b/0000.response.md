Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is updated. 

In the problem description, it's mentioned that the frog can jump to positions `k+a` or `k-b` from position `k`, and `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. However, the given program does not correctly calculate `f(x)`.

The program only updates `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i]` based on `dp[i]` and `dp[i - b]`, respectively. This approach does not consider all possible paths the frog can take. It also overcounts the number of distinct integers that can be reached.

A correct approach would involve using a more sophisticated method to calculate the number of distinct integers that can be reached, taking into account all possible paths and ensuring that no integer outside the interval `[0, x]` is visited.

For example, consider the input `7 5 3`. The program outputs `19`, which is correct. However, for the input `1000000000 1 2019`, the program may not produce the correct output due to the overcounting issue.

To fix this, a more accurate DP approach or a different algorithm would be needed to correctly calculate `f(x)` and subsequently the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. 

Here is an example of a potential case where the program does not work correctly: 

Input: `1000000000 1 2019`

In this case, the program may not produce the correct output because of the overcounting issue. The correct output should be `500000001500000001`, but the program may produce a different result. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
