Correctness: **True**.

The code provided calculates the sum of all distinct integers the frog can reach from position 0 to position m, given the constraints that the frog can jump a or -b from a position k. The code seems to handle all possible cases correctly.

The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. This is used to simplify the problem by dividing both a and b by their GCD, which does not change the set of reachable positions but reduces the size of the problem.

The function `func_2(m, a, b)` calculates the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach. If the GCD of a and b is not 1, it calls itself recursively with the simplified problem (a and b divided by their GCD) and multiplies the result by the GCD. If the GCD is 1, it calculates the sum directly using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

The code handles the cases where m is less than a + b - 1 (in which case the frog can only reach positions 0 to m) and where m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1 (in which case the frog can reach all positions from 0 to m).

All the provided examples are handled correctly by the code. The formula used in `func_2` seems to be correct, and the recursive call with the simplified problem is also correct. 

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case that the program does not handle correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the program seems to be correct.
