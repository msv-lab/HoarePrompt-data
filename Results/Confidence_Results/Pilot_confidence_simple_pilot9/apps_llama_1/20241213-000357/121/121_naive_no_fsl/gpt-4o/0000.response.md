Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The program first checks if the length of the genome is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints '===' and returns, as it is impossible to decode the genome in this case.

2. It then initializes a dictionary to count the occurrences of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the genome.

3. The program checks if the count of any nucleotide type exceeds the target count (n // 4). If so, it prints '===' and returns, as it is impossible to decode the genome in this case.

4. The program then iterates over the genome. For each unrecognized nucleotide ('?'), it finds a nucleotide type with a count less than the target count and replaces the unrecognized nucleotide with that type.

5. The program ensures that the count of each nucleotide type is equal to the target count after decoding.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

- When the genome is already decoded correctly.
- When the genome can be decoded by replacing unrecognized nucleotides.
- When it is impossible to decode the genome (e.g., when the length of the genome is not divisible by 4, or when the count of any nucleotide type exceeds the target count).

The program does not have any obvious bugs or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. The test cases provided also demonstrate the program's correctness.
