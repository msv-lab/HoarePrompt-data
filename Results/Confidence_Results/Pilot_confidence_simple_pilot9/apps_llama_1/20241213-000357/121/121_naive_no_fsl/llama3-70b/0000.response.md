Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the genome decoding problem as described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program starts by counting the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`. It ignores the '?' characters for now.
2. It then calculates the average count of each nucleotide that the decoded genome should have, which is `n // 4`.
3. For each nucleotide, it calculates how many more of that nucleotide are needed to reach the average count by subtracting the current count from the average count.
4. It then iterates over the input string again, replacing '?' characters with the nucleotides that are needed to reach the average count.
5. If there are any remaining nucleotides that need to be replaced (i.e., `count` is not all zeros), it prints '===', indicating that the genome cannot be decoded.
6. If the genome can be decoded, it prints the decoded string.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the input string already has an equal number of each nucleotide, the program will leave it unchanged.
* If the input string has '?' characters, the program will replace them with the necessary nucleotides to achieve an equal count.
* If it's impossible to decode the genome (e.g., if there are too many '?' characters or if the length of the string is not a multiple of 4), the program will print '==='.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
