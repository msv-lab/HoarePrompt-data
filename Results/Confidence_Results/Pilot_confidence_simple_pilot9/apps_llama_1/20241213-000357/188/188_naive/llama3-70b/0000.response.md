Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- The program starts by reading the number of cards, `n`, which is given to be an even number.
- It then reads the numbers on each card and stores them in a list `a`.
- The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each number on the cards.
- It then iterates over the dictionary to find two numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. If such numbers are found, it prints "YES" along with the two numbers. If not, it prints "NO".
- The program's logic is sound, as it correctly identifies when there are two distinct numbers that each appear half the time, which is the condition for a fair game.

The program handles all the cases correctly, including the edge cases where there are no two distinct numbers that appear exactly half the time, or when all cards have the same number. 

Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs and follows the problem description accurately.
