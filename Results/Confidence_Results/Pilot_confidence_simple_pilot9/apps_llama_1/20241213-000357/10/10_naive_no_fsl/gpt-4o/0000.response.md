Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the number of sofas to the left and right of a given sofa. The condition `if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j` only checks if the entire sofa `i` is to the left of sofa `j`, but it does not consider the case where part of sofa `i` is to the left of sofa `j`. 

For example, if sofa `i` is located at `(2, 1, 3, 1)` and sofa `j` is located at `(3, 2, 4, 2)`, sofa `i` should be considered to the left of sofa `j` because `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 >= x1_j`. However, the current program does not count this case.

Similarly, the condition `if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j` only checks if the entire sofa `i` is to the right of sofa `j`, but it does not consider the case where part of sofa `i` is to the right of sofa `j`.

To correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left and right of a given sofa, the program should check if any part of sofa `i` is to the left or right of sofa `j`, not just the entire sofa. 

Here's a correct version of the program:
```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if min(x1, x2) < min(x1_j, x2_j) and max(x1, x2) < max(x1_j, x2_j):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if min(x1_j, x2_j) < min(x1, x2) and max(x1_j, x2_j) < max(x1, x2):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if min(y1, y2) < min(y1_j, y2_j) and max(y1, y2) < max(y1_j, y2_j):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if min(y1_j, y2_j) < min(y1, y2) and max(y1_j, y2_j) < max(y1, y2):
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
```
