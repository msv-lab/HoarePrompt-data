Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the conditions for checking the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

The function `func_1` only checks if the first cell of the given sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first cell of another sofa. However, according to the problem description, a sofa A is considered to be to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that `x_a < x_b`, a is covered by A, and b is covered by B. The same condition applies to the right, top, and bottom.

In the provided code, the function `func_1` does not consider all possible cells of the sofas, it only checks the first cell of each sofa. This is incorrect because a sofa can be to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa even if their first cells do not meet the condition.

For example, consider a case where two sofas have coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2) and (1, 3), (1, 4) respectively. In this case, the second sofa is below the first sofa, but the function `func_1` would not correctly identify this because it only checks the first cell of each sofa.

To correctly implement the conditions, the function `func_1` should check all possible cells of the sofas, not just the first cell. 

Here's an example of how the function `func_1` could be corrected:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            for cell in cells:
                for s_cell in s_cells:
                    if cell[0] < s_cell[0]:
                        left += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[0] > s_cell[0]:
                        right += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] < s_cell[1]:
                        top += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] > s_cell[1]:
                        bottom += 1
                        break
            left = min(1, left)
            right = min(1, right)
            top = min(1, top)
            bottom = min(1, bottom)
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

However, this correction still doesn't handle the case where a sofa can be both to the left and right (or top and bottom) of another sofa. The problem description states that a sofa can be both to the left and right (or top and bottom) of another sofa, but the provided code and the corrected version do not handle this case correctly.

A correct implementation would need to consider all possible pairs of cells between the two sofas and count the number of pairs where one cell is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the other cell. The counts should then be adjusted to ensure that each sofa is only counted once, even if it has multiple cells that meet the condition. 

For example:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            left_to_s = False
            right_to_s = False
            top_to_s = False
            bottom_to_s = False
            for cell in cells:
                for s_cell in s_cells:
                    if cell[0] < s_cell[0]:
                        left_to_s = True
                    elif cell[0] > s_cell[0]:
                        right_to_s = True
                    elif cell[1] < s_cell[1]:
                        top_to_s = True
                    elif cell[1] > s_cell[1]:
                        bottom_to_s = True
            if left_to_s:
                left += 1
            if right_to_s:
                right += 1
            if top_to_s:
                top += 1
            if bottom_to_s:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```
