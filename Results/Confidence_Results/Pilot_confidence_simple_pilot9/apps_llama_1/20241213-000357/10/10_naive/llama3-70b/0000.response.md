Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which only checks if the first cell of the sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first cell of another sofa. However, the problem statement defines the conditions based on the existence of cells that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of each other, not necessarily the first cells.

For example, consider a sofa that spans two cells `(x1, y1)` and `(x1, y2)`, and another sofa that spans two cells `(x2, y1)` and `(x2, y3)`, where `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2 < y3`. In this case, the first sofa is to the left of the second sofa because `(x1, y1)` is to the left of `(x2, y1)`. However, the `func_1` function would incorrectly count this case because it only checks the first cells `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y1)`, which are to the left and right of each other, but it does not check the other cells `(x1, y2)` and `(x2, y3)`.

To correctly implement the logic, the `func_1` function should check all cells of a sofa, not just the first cell. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            for cell in cells:
                for s_cell in s_cells:
                    if cell[0] < s_cell[0]:
                        left += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[0] > s_cell[0]:
                        right += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] < s_cell[1]:
                        top += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] > s_cell[1]:
                        bottom += 1
                        break
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```
However, even with this correction, the program would still not work correctly because it counts the number of sofas that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of a given sofa, but it does not consider the correct definition of "left", "right", "top", and "bottom" according to the problem statement. 

A correct implementation would require a more complex logic to count the number of sofas that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of a given sofa, based on the existence of cells that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of each other. 

For example, to count the number of sofas to the left of a given sofa, the program should iterate over all cells of all sofas and check if there exists a cell that is to the left of a cell of the given sofa. If such a cell exists, the program should increment the count of sofas to the left. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    sofa_cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for (j, s) in enumerate(sofas):
        if i!= j:
            s_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            left_to_s = False
            right_to_s = False
            top_to_s = False
            bottom_to_s = False
            for cell in sofa_cells:
                for s_cell in s_cells:
                    if cell[0] < s_cell[0]:
                        left_to_s = True
                    elif cell[0] > s_cell[0]:
                        right_to_s = True
                    elif cell[1] < s_cell[1]:
                        top_to_s = True
                    elif cell[1] > s_cell[1]:
                        bottom_to_s = True
            if left_to_s:
                left += 1
            if right_to_s:
                right += 1
            if top_to_s:
                top += 1
            if bottom_to_s:
                bottom += 1
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)
```
This corrected version of the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of sofas that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of a given sofa, based on the existence of cells that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of each other.
