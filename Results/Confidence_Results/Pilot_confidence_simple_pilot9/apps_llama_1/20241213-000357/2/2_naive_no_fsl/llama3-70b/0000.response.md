Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly when the input number `x` is a large number, such as `10^18`. The reason is that the program uses a loop that iterates from `1` to `x + 1`, which will cause a memory error or take an extremely long time to run for large inputs. 

Instead, the program should find the maximum sum of digits for numbers less than or equal to `x` in a more efficient way. One approach is to start from `x` and decrement the number until the sum of its digits is maximized.

For example, if the input is `100`, the program should directly compare the sum of digits of numbers like `99`, `98`, `97`, etc., and return the one with the maximum sum, instead of iterating from `1` to `100`. 

The program should also handle the case where there are multiple numbers with the same maximum sum of digits and return the largest one. 

The given program does not handle these cases correctly and is therefore incorrect. 

A correct approach would be to iterate from `x` down to `1` and keep track of the number with the maximum sum of digits. This way, if there are multiple numbers with the same maximum sum of digits, the largest one will be returned. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(x, 0, -1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(i)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
        elif digit_sum == max_sum:
            max_num = max(max_num, i)
    print(max_num)
```
However, even this corrected version is not efficient for very large inputs like `10^18`, and a more efficient algorithm would be needed to handle such cases.
