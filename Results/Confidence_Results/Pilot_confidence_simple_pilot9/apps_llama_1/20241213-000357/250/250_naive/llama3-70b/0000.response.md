Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it adds extra marks that are not necessarily needed to measure the distances x and y. For example, if the input is "4 250 185 230" and the sequence of marks is "0 20 185 250", the program will output "0", which is correct. However, if we add a mark at position 230, it will also be able to measure the distance 230. But the program will add the mark 230 and then add the mark 230 + 185 = 415, which is outside the length of the ruler and also not needed.

Another issue with the program is that it checks all pairs of marks to see if their difference is equal to x or y, which is inefficient and can be improved. It also adds marks to the additional_marks list that may already be present in the original marks, which can lead to incorrect results.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to first check if the ruler already has marks that can measure the distances x and y. If not, it should add the minimum number of marks necessary to measure these distances. This can be done by checking if there is a mark at position x or y, or if there is a mark that can be combined with another mark to measure these distances. 

The issue can be fixed by improving the logic of the program to handle these cases correctly. For example, instead of adding x and y to the additional_marks list if they are not already present, the program could check if there is a mark at position x and y, or if there is a mark that can be combined with another mark to measure these distances. 

The correct program should also handle the case where the marks are not always in ascending order, even though the problem description states that they are. This can be done by sorting the marks before processing them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = sorted(set(map(int, input().split())))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    additional_marks = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    if not need_x and x not in marks:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y and y not in marks:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    if len(additional_marks) == 0:
        print("0")
    else:
        print(len(additional_marks))
        print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
```

This version of the program correctly handles the case where the ruler already has marks that can measure the distances x and y, and it only adds the minimum number of marks necessary to measure these distances. It also handles the case where the marks are not always in ascending order.
