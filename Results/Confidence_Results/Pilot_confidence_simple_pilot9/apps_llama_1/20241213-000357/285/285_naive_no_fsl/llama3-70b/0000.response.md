Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if it's possible to spend all of Kolya's initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's why the code works:

1. It iterates over all possible numbers of houses (`a`) that can be bought, given the initial amount of game-coins (`n`).
2. For each number of houses, it iterates over all possible numbers of cars (`b`) that can be bought, given the remaining amount of game-coins after buying `a` houses.
3. For each number of houses and cars, it calculates the maximum number of computers (`c`) that can be bought, given the remaining amount of game-coins after buying `a` houses and `b` cars.
4. If it finds a combination of houses, cars, and computers that exactly equals the initial amount of game-coins (`n`), it prints 'YES' and exits.
5. If it checks all possible combinations and doesn't find one that exactly equals the initial amount of game-coins, it prints 'NO'.

This program covers all possible cases, as it checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought with the initial amount of game-coins. The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the program only considers whole numbers of houses, cars, and computers, as specified in the problem description. 

The code also uses `exit()` to immediately terminate the program as soon as it finds a valid solution, which makes it more efficient. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
