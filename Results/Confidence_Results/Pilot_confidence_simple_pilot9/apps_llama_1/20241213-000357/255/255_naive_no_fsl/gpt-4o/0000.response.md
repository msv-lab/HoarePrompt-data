Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$. The key to this problem is that we only need to count the number of transitions between different characters in the string, as each group of the same character can be deleted in one operation.

Here's why the program works:

1. The program starts with `operations = 1`, assuming the string is not empty. This is because even if the string consists of a single character, we need one operation to delete it.

2. It then iterates through the string, comparing each character with the previous one. Whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one (`s[i]!= s[i - 1]`), it increments the `operations` counter. This effectively counts the number of transitions between different characters.

3. The program prints the total number of operations, which represents the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string.

All the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. The program handles strings of any length up to 500 characters and correctly counts the minimum number of operations to delete the string.

The program also handles edge cases, such as:

- A string consisting of a single character (e.g., "aaa"). The program correctly outputs 1 operation.

- A string consisting of all different characters (e.g., "abcdef"). The program correctly outputs the number of characters in the string.

- An empty string. Although the problem description does not explicitly mention empty strings, the program will raise an error when trying to access the first character of the string (`s[0]`) if the string is empty. However, since the problem description states that the string has a length of at least 1, this case is not relevant.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
