Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly implements the task described in the problem. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used to cook the compote based on the available number of lemons, apples, and pears.

Here's why the program works correctly:
- It takes the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input.
- It calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of the available lemons, available apples divided by 2, and available pears divided by 4. This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of lemons, apples, or pears.
- It then prints the total number of fruits used, which is the number of lemons plus twice the number of lemons (for apples) plus four times the number of lemons (for pears).

The program handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly:
- For the input `2`, `5`, `7`, it outputs `7`, which is correct because Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
- For the input `4`, `7`, `13`, it outputs `21`, which is correct because Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.
- For the input `2`, `3`, `2`, it outputs `0`, which is correct because Nikolay does not have enough pears to cook any compote.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
