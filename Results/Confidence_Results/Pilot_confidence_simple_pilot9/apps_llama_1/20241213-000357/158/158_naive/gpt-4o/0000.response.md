Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The `func` function takes three inputs, `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote by finding the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the ratio of lemons, apples, and pears is maintained at 1:2:4.

The total number of fruits is then calculated by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and summing these values. This correctly implements the problem description, which requires that the maximum total number of fruits be returned.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the number of apples or pears is not sufficient to maintain the required ratio. In such cases, the program correctly returns 0, indicating that no compote can be made.

For example, if the inputs are 2, 5, and 7, the program correctly returns 7, which is the sum of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. Similarly, if the inputs are 4, 7, and 13, the program correctly returns 21, which is the sum of 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears. If the inputs are 2, 3, and 2, the program correctly returns 0, indicating that no compote can be made.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.
