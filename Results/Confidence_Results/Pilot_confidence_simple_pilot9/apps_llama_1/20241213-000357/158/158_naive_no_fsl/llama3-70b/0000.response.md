Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The program calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how it works:

- The program first reads the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) as input.
- It then calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used to cook the compote based on the available number of fruits. This is done by taking the minimum of the number of lemons (a), the number of apples divided by 2 (b // 2), and the number of pears divided by 4 (c // 4). 
- The minimum number of lemons that can be used is stored in the variable `min_lemon`.
- Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote, which is calculated as `min_lemon` (the number of lemons) + `min_lemon * 2` (the number of apples) + `min_lemon * 4` (the number of pears).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including cases where there are not enough fruits to cook the compote, in which case it prints 0. 

For example, if there are 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the program correctly calculates `min_lemon` as 0 (because there are not enough pears to cook the compote), and prints 0 as the result. 

Similarly, if there are 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the program correctly calculates `min_lemon` as 1, and prints 7 as the result (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears).

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible cases.
