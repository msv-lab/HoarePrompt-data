Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly determines the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations. The program sorts the array and then iterates over it, keeping track of the minimum positive integer (mex) that doesn't appear in the array. If the current number is equal to mex, it increments mex. If the current number is greater than mex, it breaks the loop because all subsequent numbers will also be greater than mex.

The program works correctly for all cases because it takes into account the ability to decrease any element of the array to a smaller positive integer. By sorting the array and iterating over it, the program effectively "compactifies" the array, reducing all consecutive numbers to the smallest possible value. This ensures that the maximum possible value of mex is achieved.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input array is already compactified or when there are duplicate elements in the array. The break statement in the loop ensures that the program doesn't unnecessarily iterate over the rest of the array once it has found a number greater than mex.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
