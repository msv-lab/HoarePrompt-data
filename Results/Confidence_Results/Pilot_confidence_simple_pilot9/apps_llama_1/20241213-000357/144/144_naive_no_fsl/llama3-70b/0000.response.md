Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations.

The program sorts the array and then iterates over it, keeping track of the current mex. If the current number is equal to the current mex, it increments the mex. If the current number is greater than the current mex, it breaks the loop, because any further numbers will not affect the mex.

This approach works because the mex is the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array. By sorting the array and iterating over it, the program ensures that it considers all possible values that could be the mex.

The program correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, as well as the case where the array contains numbers that are greater than the mex.

For example, if the input is `5 1 3 3 3 6`, the program will output `5`, which is correct. If the input is `2 2 1`, the program will output `3`, which is also correct.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the given program. Therefore, the program is correct.
