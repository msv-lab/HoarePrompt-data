Correctness: **False**

The program is trying to find a matrix of size x Ã— y such that a given path can be traversed in the matrix. However, the program has some issues. 

One issue is that it only checks for x and y up to 1000001, which is not sufficient according to the problem description, which states that x and y can be up to 10^9.

Another issue is that it breaks the loop for y as soon as it finds an x * y that is greater than the maximum value in the input list a. This is not correct because it should continue to check for all possible values of y, not just up to the point where x * y is greater than max(a).

Also, the function func_1 only checks if the difference between the current position and the next position is 1, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the path can be traversed in the matrix.

For example, if the input is 2 and the path is 1 10, the program should output YES with x = 4 and y = 3, but the program does not check for these values.

Here is an example case when the program does not work correctly:

Input:
2
1 10

Expected Output:
YES
4 3

But the program does not output this because it only checks for x and y up to 1000001 and it breaks the loop for y as soon as it finds an x * y that is greater than the maximum value in the input list a.

To fix this issue, the program should check for all possible values of x and y up to 10^9 and it should not break the loop for y as soon as it finds an x * y that is greater than the maximum value in the input list a.

Here is the correct version of the code:

```python
def func_1(x, y, a):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)!= 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_val = max(a)
for x in range(1, int(max_val ** 0.5) + 1):
    if max_val % x == 0:
        y = max_val // x
        if func_1(x, y, a):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
        if x!= y and func_1(y, x, a):
            print('YES')
            print(y, x)
            exit()
print('NO')
```

This code correctly checks for all possible values of x and y up to 10^9 and it does not break the loop for y as soon as it finds an x * y that is greater than the maximum value in the input list a. It also correctly checks if the path can be traversed in the matrix by calling the function func_1.
