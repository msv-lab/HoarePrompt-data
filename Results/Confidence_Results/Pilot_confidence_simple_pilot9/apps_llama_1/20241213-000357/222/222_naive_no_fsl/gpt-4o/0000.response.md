Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers and prints the corresponding skewer numbers. 

The approach used in the program is based on the idea that if we turn over every (2k + 1)th skewer, starting from the first one, we can ensure that all skewers are turned over. This is because turning over a skewer also turns over the k skewers on either side of it, resulting in a total of (2k + 1) skewers being turned over in each step.

The program starts from the first skewer and turns over every (2k + 1)th skewer, effectively covering the entire range of skewers. This approach ensures that all skewers are turned over with the minimum possible number of actions.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, including when n is less than or equal to (2k + 1), in which case it simply turns over the first skewer.

After analyzing the program and considering different potential cases, it seems that the program works correctly for all possible inputs and does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled. 

However, it's worth noting that this problem can be solved using different approaches, such as using a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming, but the provided program seems to be a simple and efficient solution. 

Overall, based on the provided program and the problem description, it appears that the program is correct and handles all potential cases as expected.
