Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It uses a greedy approach to find the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program seems to be correct:

1. The program starts from the first skewer and turns it over. It then skips `2 * k + 1` skewers and turns over the next one. This ensures that every skewer is turned over at least once.

2. The program repeats this process until all skewers have been turned over. The use of `while i <= n` ensures that the loop continues until all skewers have been considered.

3. The program prints the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers, which is the length of the `positions` list. It then prints the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over.

The program seems to handle all edge cases correctly, including when `n` is odd or even, and when `k` is 0 or a large number. 

The greedy approach used in the program appears to be optimal because turning over every `2 * k + 1`th skewer ensures that every skewer is turned over at least once, and this is the minimum number of actions needed to achieve this.

In conclusion, based on the provided code and problem description, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
