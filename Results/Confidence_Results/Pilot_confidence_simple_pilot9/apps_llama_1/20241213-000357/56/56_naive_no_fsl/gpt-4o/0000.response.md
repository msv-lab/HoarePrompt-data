Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One issue with the program is that it only considers non-negative integers as possible solutions. However, the problem description allows for negative integers in the sequence.

For example, for the input `1 2`, the program correctly outputs `Yes\n-1 -1`, but this is because the problem description explicitly states that this is a valid solution, not because the program is correctly handling negative integers.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle cases where the input value `n` is very large. The program uses bitwise operations to extract the bits of `n`, but it only checks up to the 60th bit. This means that if `n` is a very large number that requires more than 60 bits to represent, the program will not work correctly.

Finally, the program does not correctly handle cases where the input value `k` is very large. The program uses a while loop to add additional integers to the sequence until its length is equal to `k`, but it does not check if the value `n` can actually be represented as the sum of `k` powers of 2.

For example, for the input `13 100`, the program will output `No`, but this is because it is unable to find a sequence of 100 integers whose sum is equal to `n`, not because it has correctly determined that no such sequence exists.

To fix these issues, the program would need to be modified to correctly handle negative integers, very large input values, and cases where the input value `k` is very large. 

Here's an example of an input where the program does not work correctly: `19 4`. The program should output `Yes\n3 2 1 0`, but it actually outputs `No`.
