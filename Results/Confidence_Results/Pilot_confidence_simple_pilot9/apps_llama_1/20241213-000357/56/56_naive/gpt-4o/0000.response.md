Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to be correct based on the problem description. It first checks if the number of integers (k) is greater than the given number (n), which would be impossible to achieve. Then it uses bitwise operations to extract the bits of the number n. It checks if the number of bits is greater than k, in which case it's not possible to form the required sequence. 

If the number of bits is less than k, it tries to fill the rest of the bits by repeatedly breaking the smallest bit into two smaller bits, which is equivalent to splitting a power of 2 into two smaller powers of 2. This process ensures that the resulting sequence is lexicographically largest.

Finally, the bits are sorted in descending order and returned as the required sequence. 

The program handles all possible cases, including edge cases like when n is 1 and k is 2, where it correctly returns "Yes" with the sequence "-1 -1". 

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
