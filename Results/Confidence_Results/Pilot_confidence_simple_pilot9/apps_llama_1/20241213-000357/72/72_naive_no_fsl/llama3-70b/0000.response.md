Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case when the number of rows is 1 correctly.

When there is only one row, the teacher asks the pupils in the same row repeatedly. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. The calculation of `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` does not take into account the fact that the teacher is asking the same row repeatedly.

For example, if the input is `1 3 8 1 1`, the program should output `3 3 3`, but it outputs `3 2 3`. This is because the program does not correctly calculate the number of times Sergei is asked when there is only one row.

To fix this bug, we need to add a special case to handle the situation when there is only one row. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if n == 1:
        max_asked = k // m + (1 if k % m >= y else 0)
        min_asked = k // m + (1 if k % m > 0 else 0) - (1 if k % m >= y else 0)
        sergei_asked = k // m + (1 if k % m >= y else 0)
    else:
        max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
        min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
        sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
