Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. It does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the points when the area of the triangle is not aligned with the x or y axis.

For example, consider the input `5 6 3`. The area of the triangle should be `10`, but the program will not find the correct points to form a triangle with this area.

The condition `if 2 * area <= n` and `elif 2 * area <= m` are not sufficient to cover all cases. The program also does not consider cases where the points should be at different positions than `(0, 0)`, `(2 * area, 1)`, and `(0, 1)` or `(1, 2 * area)`, `(1, 0)`.

The program only considers two cases where the points are aligned with the x or y axis, but there can be many other cases where the points are not aligned.

The correct approach would be to use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle for any given points, and then try to find three points that satisfy the given conditions. However, the given program does not implement this and therefore is incorrect.
