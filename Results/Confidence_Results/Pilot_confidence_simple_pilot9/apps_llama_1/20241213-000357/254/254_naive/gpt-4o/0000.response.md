Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases because it only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers is 1. However, this is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, there would be at least one lit garland.

For example, if the input is 2 4 6, the program will output 'NO' because the GCD of the three numbers is 2, not 1. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible to find a solution. A more thorough analysis is required to determine whether a solution exists.

Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that the condition `gcd(k1, k2) == 1` or `gcd(k1, k3) == 1` or `gcd(k2, k3) == 1` should be enough to guarantee that there is a solution. 

The provided Python code does not take into account these cases and might incorrectly output 'NO' for some inputs where a solution actually exists. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect. 

It's also worth noting that a correct approach to solve this problem would be to check for the existence of a solution by considering all possible combinations of switching on the garlands. However, the provided code does not implement this approach and relies solely on the GCD condition, which is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of a solution. 

For instance, we can take the input `4 2 3` as an example where `gcd(2,3)=1`. This input will incorrectly output 'YES' by a corrected version of the provided program. The original program will also incorrectly output 'NO' because `gcd(gcd(4,2),3) = gcd(2,3) = 1` but `gcd(4,2)=2`. The program should ideally find all such cases where at least two of the intervals are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1) and return 'YES' immediately for such cases. If no such pair is found, it should return 'NO'.
