Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a solution to compare two numbers, X and Y, represented in different bases. The program defines a helper function `func_1` to convert the digits of a number from a given base to decimal. It then uses this function to convert the digits of both X and Y to decimal, and finally compares the two decimal numbers.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The `func_1` function correctly converts the digits of a number from a given base to decimal. It does this by iterating over the digits, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is the standard method for converting a number from a non-decimal base to decimal.

2. **Comparison**: After converting both X and Y to decimal, the program compares the two numbers using simple conditional statements. If X is less than Y, it prints '<'; if X is greater than Y, it prints '>'; otherwise, it prints '='. This is a straightforward and correct way to compare two numbers.

3. **Handling Inputs**: The program correctly reads the input values for the number of digits and the base of X and Y. It also correctly reads the digits of X and Y and passes them to the `func_1` function for conversion.

4. **Examples**: The provided examples demonstrate that the program works correctly in different scenarios. The program correctly handles cases where X and Y are equal (Example 1), X is less than Y (Example 2), and X is greater than Y (Example 3).

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic for comparing two numbers represented in different bases, and it handles various scenarios as demonstrated by the examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
