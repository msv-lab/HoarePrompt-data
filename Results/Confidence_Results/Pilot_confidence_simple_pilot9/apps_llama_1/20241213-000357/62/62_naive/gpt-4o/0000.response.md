Correctness: **True**.

The program provided correctly implements the comparison of two numbers represented in different bases. It first reads the input for both numbers, then converts each number to its decimal equivalent using a helper function `func_1`. This function uses the standard algorithm for converting a number from any base to decimal, which is to multiply the current decimal value by the base and add the next digit.

The program handles all the potential cases correctly, including:

*   Comparing numbers of different lengths
*   Comparing numbers with different bases
*   Handling leading zeroes correctly (since the problem statement ensures that there will be no leading zeroes)
*   Correctly comparing equal numbers

The program also follows the problem description's output format, printing '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it's greater, and '=' if they are equal.

The use of the `func_1` helper function makes the code more readable and maintainable. The variable names are also clear and descriptive, which makes the code easier to understand.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
