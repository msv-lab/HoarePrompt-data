Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The issue lies in the way `func_2(n)` calculates `f_max_n`. The function `func_2(n)` does not correctly calculate the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`. 

The function `func_2(n)` simply calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers from `1` to `n`, which is not the correct approach to calculate `f_max_n`. The correct approach would be to find the maximum number of distinct GCDs that can be obtained from the prefix of the permutation.

For example, when `n = 4`, the function `func_2(n)` returns `1`, which is incorrect. The correct value of `f_max_n` for `n = 4` is `2`, because there are permutations where the GCD of the prefix changes twice, for example, the permutation `[2, 4, 1, 3]`.

The function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` also seems to be incorrect, as it does not take into account the actual permutation of numbers and how the GCD of the prefix changes. It simply calculates the sum of the previous values in the `dp` array, which does not correctly represent the number of permutations where `f(p)` is equal to `f_max_n`.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
