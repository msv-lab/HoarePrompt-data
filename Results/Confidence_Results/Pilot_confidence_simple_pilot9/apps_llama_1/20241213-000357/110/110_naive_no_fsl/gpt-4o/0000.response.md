Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the greedy strategy to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program works:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.
2. The `coverage` function calculates the number of positions where a fish at cell `(x, y)` can be caught by the scoop-net. This is done by checking how many scoop-net positions can cover the cell `(x, y)`.
3. A priority queue (implemented using a heap) is used to store the cells in the pond, where the priority of each cell is its coverage (i.e., the number of scoop-net positions that can cover it). The cells with higher coverage have higher priority.
4. The program pops the `k` cells with the highest coverage from the priority queue and sums their coverage values. This is the total coverage of the `k` fishes.
5. Finally, the program returns the total coverage divided by the total number of possible scoop-net positions, which is the expected number of caught fishes.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly:

* It correctly calculates the coverage of each cell in the pond.
* It uses a greedy strategy to select the cells with the highest coverage, which maximizes the expected number of caught fishes.
* It handles the cases where the scoop-net can cover only a part of the pond.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

The time complexity of the program is O(n*m*log(n*m)) due to the use of the priority queue, where n and m are the dimensions of the pond. The space complexity is O(n*m) for storing the priority queue.

Note that the program assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)). If the input values are not valid, the program may not work correctly. However, this is not a problem with the program itself, but rather with the input validation.
