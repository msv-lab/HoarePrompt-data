Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. The program simply prints `1/n/2` and `1/n` as the fractions, which does not satisfy the condition `1/n/2 + 1/n = 1 - 1/n`.

For example, when `n = 3`, the program prints `1 1` and `1 3`, which corresponds to the fractions `1/1` and `1/3`. However, `1/1 + 1/3` does not equal `1 - 1/3 = 2/3`.

Another issue with the program is that it does not check if `n` is even or odd. When `n` is even, the program will print `1 n/2` and `1 n`, which corresponds to the fractions `1/(n/2)` and `1/n`. However, `1/(n/2)` is equal to `2/n`, not `1/n/2`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to find the fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n` and also satisfy the conditions `b_i divides n`, `1 < b_i < n`, and `1 <= a_i < b_i`. 

One possible way to solve this problem is to find the divisors of `n` and then try to find a combination of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. The program should also handle the case where `n = 2`, in which case the output should be "NO". 

A possible correct solution would involve iterating over all possible divisors of `n`, checking if the current divisor can be used to form a fraction that is less than `1 - 1/n`, and then recursively trying to find the remaining fractions that sum up to the remaining value. 

Here's an example of a correct solution:

```python
def find_fractions(n):
    def find_divisors(n):
        divisors = []
        for i in range(2, n):
            if n % i == 0:
                divisors.append(i)
        return divisors

    def find_fractions_recursive(n, divisors, current_sum, fractions):
        if current_sum == 1 - 1/n:
            return fractions
        for divisor in divisors:
            for numerator in range(1, divisor):
                new_sum = current_sum + numerator / divisor
                if new_sum <= 1 - 1/n:
                    new_divisors = [d for d in divisors if d!= divisor]
                    new_fractions = find_fractions_recursive(n, new_divisors, new_sum, fractions + [(numerator, divisor)])
                    if new_fractions:
                        return new_fractions
        return None

    divisors = find_divisors(n)
    fractions = find_fractions_recursive(n, divisors, 0, [])
    if fractions:
        print("YES")
        print(len(fractions))
        for fraction in fractions:
            print(fraction[0], fraction[1])
    else:
        print("NO")

n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    print("NO")
else:
    find_fractions(n)
