Correctness: **False**.

This program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases according to the problem description. 

For example, when the input is 6, the program does not print the correct sequence of fractions as described in the problem. The correct sequence for n = 6 is 1/2 and 1/3, as stated in the problem, but the program prints 1/n/2 and 1/n which doesn't make sense in this context.

Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the fractions for other inputs. It always prints '1' as the numerator and either 'n // 2' or 'n' as the denominator, which is not a valid solution to the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of fractions that sum up to 1 - 1/n, where each fraction has a denominator that divides n and a numerator that is less than the denominator. 

For instance, we can use the following approach: 
- If n is even, we can use 1/2 and 1/(2*(n//2)) (1/n) which sums up to 1 - 1/n.
- If n is odd and greater than 2, we can use 1/3, 1/((n-1)//2) and other fractions to sum up to 1 - 1/n, but this requires more complex calculations.

In conclusion, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, so its correctness is False.
