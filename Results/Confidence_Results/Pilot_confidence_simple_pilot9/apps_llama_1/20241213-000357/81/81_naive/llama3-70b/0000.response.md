Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly because it does not consider the case when a ≠ b. The program only checks for pairs (a, b) where a ≤ b, but the problem states that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.

In the given program, the inner loop only runs from `a` to `r + 1`, which means it only checks for pairs where `b` is greater than or equal to `a`. However, it does not check for pairs where `b` is less than `a`.

For example, if the input is `1 2 1 2`, the program will only check for the pair `(1, 2)` but not for the pair `(2, 1)`, which is also a good pair according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program should also check for pairs where `b` is less than `a`, which can be done by running the inner loop from `l` to `r + 1` instead of from `a` to `r + 1`.
