Correctness: **True**.

The given program follows the problem description and handles all the potential cases correctly. It first finds the boundaries of the white pixels, then determines the size of the frame based on these boundaries. If the frame size is larger than the screen size, it prints -1. Otherwise, it constructs the frame by replacing the black pixels on the frame's border with '+' and leaving the white pixels as they are.

The program correctly handles the cases where the frame size is 1, and where the required frame doesn't exist. It also handles cases where the white pixels are not on the same row or column, and where the frame size is larger than the number of white pixels.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It checks for the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which defines the frame's size and position. It then constructs the frame by replacing the appropriate black pixels with '+'.

The provided examples also demonstrate that the program works as expected in different scenarios. Therefore, based on the given code and problem description, the program is correct.
