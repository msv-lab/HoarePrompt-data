Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum size frame that can be drawn around the white pixels. 

In the program, the frame size is determined by the bounding box of the white pixels, which may not be the smallest possible frame. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4 4
w...
..w.
....
....
```
The program will output:
```
w+++
.+..
++++
....
```
However, the smallest possible frame that can be drawn around the white pixels is:
```
w+++
..+.
....
....
```
The program does not handle this case correctly.

Also, the program does not handle the case where the frame size is 1x1 correctly. According to the problem description, if the frame size is 1x1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel. The program should output the original input in this case, but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
