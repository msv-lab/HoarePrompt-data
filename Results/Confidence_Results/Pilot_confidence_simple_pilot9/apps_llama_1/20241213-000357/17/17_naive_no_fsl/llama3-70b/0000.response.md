Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly check if it's possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings. 

The given code only checks if `cnt3 > cnt1`, but this is not sufficient to determine if a regular bracket sequence can be formed. The correct condition should also consider the total number of opening and closing brackets.

For example, if `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`, the code will print `1`, but it's not possible to form a regular bracket sequence because the total number of opening brackets (`cnt3 + cnt4 = 2`) is not equal to the total number of closing brackets (`cnt3 + cnt4 = 2`), and the string ")(" is not a regular bracket sequence.

However, in the context of this specific problem, the condition `cnt3 > cnt1` is indeed insufficient, but the code misses an additional condition: `cnt1 + cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4`. 

A correct code should check both conditions. If either condition is not met, it should print `0`. 

Here is a correct code:
```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 < cnt3 + cnt4 or cnt3 > cnt1 + cnt2:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
```
