Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it checks two conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a regular bracket sequence to be formed from the given strings.

1. `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4`: This condition ensures that the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets, which is a necessary condition for a regular bracket sequence.

2. `cnt2 >= cnt3`: This condition ensures that there are enough strings of the form `()` to "absorb" all the strings of the form `)("`, which is also a necessary condition for a regular bracket sequence. If there are more strings of the form `)(" than `()`, it would not be possible to form a regular bracket sequence.

If both conditions are met, it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by arranging the strings in a way that maintains a balance between opening and closing brackets.

The program checks these two conditions and prints `1` if they are met, and `0` otherwise. Since these conditions are necessary and sufficient for a regular bracket sequence to be formed, the program is correct. 

I have checked the given examples and the program works correctly for all of them. I was also unable to think of any additional example where the program does not work correctly, which further suggests that the program is correct.
