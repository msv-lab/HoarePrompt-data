Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input (6, 3). The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4 as shown in the example in the problem description. The correct steps to transform the equilateral triangle of side length 6 to one of side length 3 are (6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3), which requires 4 steps. 

The issue with the program is that it simply calculates the absolute difference between the start and end side lengths, which does not take into account the fact that the transformation involves multiple steps, each of which can only change one side of the triangle at a time. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a more complex approach that takes into account the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This will ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate throughout the transformation process. 

Here's an example of how the correct solution might look:

- Start with an equilateral triangle of side length x.
- Reduce the length of one side to y, creating a triangle with sides (x, x, y).
- Apply the triangle inequality theorem to determine the minimum length of the other two sides that can be reduced to while keeping the triangle non-degenerate.
- Continue applying this process until all sides have length y.

The given program does not follow this approach and therefore does not produce the correct result for all cases.
