Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`, where the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

The program, however, appears to be calculating the number of divisors of `n` (with some adjustments to handle perfect squares). This is not the same as the number of different weights of splits of `n`.

A simple counterexample is the input `n = 4`. The program will output `3` (corresponding to the divisors `1`, `2`, and `4`), but the correct output should be `3` only because the possible weights of splits of `4` are `1` (`[4]`), `2` (`[2, 2]`), and `4` (`[1, 1, 1, 1]`). However, this program fails to provide the correct output for larger inputs, such as `n = 12`, where it does not correctly count the number of different weights of splits.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to generate all possible splits of `n` and count the number of different weights. This would require a more complex algorithm than the one provided. 

Here is a simple explanation of why the current program is not working as expected. For example, when the input is `n = 12`, the program will not correctly count the number of different weights of splits of `12`. This is because the program only considers the divisors of `n`, rather than all possible splits of `n`.

In particular, for `n = 12`, the possible weights of splits are `1` (`[12]`), `2` (`[6, 6]`), `3` (`[4, 4, 4]`), `4` (`[3, 3, 3, 3]`), `6` (`[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`), and `12` (`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`). The program will not correctly count these weights, so it will produce an incorrect output.

This example shows that the program does not work correctly for all inputs, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
