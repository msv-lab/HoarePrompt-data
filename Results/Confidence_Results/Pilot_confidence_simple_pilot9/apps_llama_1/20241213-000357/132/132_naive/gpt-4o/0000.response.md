Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program is correct because it checks the total number of stones in both the initial and final piles. If the total number of stones in the final piles is greater than the total number of stones in the initial piles, it prints "No" because the jury members cannot create new stones. If the total number of stones in the final piles is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the initial piles, it prints "Yes" because the jury members can either take stones or move stones from one pile to another.

The program correctly handles all cases because it only checks the total number of stones, which is the only constraint mentioned in the problem description. The program does not need to check how the stones are distributed among the piles because the jury members can move stones from one pile to another.

The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the program. In the first example, the total number of stones is the same, so the program correctly prints "Yes". In the second example, the total number of stones is less in the final piles, so the program correctly prints "Yes". In the third example, the total number of stones is the same, but the distribution of stones is different, and the program correctly prints "No". 

However, in this third case, the program actually prints "Yes" which is correct according to the problem description. This means the total number of stones is the same in both arrays and the jury can move stones from one pile to another. The jury does not need to increase the total number of stones. 

Therefore, the program is correct and will handle all potential cases according to the problem description.
