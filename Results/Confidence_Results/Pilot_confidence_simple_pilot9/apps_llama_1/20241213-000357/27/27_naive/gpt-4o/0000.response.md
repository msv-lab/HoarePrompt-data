Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the values of the 12 expressions for the given input numbers x, y, and z, and prints the expression with the maximum value. The expressions are evaluated in the correct order, and the program handles the possibility of multiple expressions having the same maximum value by printing the first one it encounters.

The program uses a lambda function as the key for the max function, which allows it to compare the pairs of values and expressions based on the values. This ensures that the expression with the maximum value is printed.

The use of tuple unpacking to assign the maximum value and the corresponding expression to the variables max_value and max_expr is a nice touch, as it allows the code to be more readable and avoids the need for indexing the tuple.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs. It correctly handles the calculation of the expressions, the comparison of the values, and the printing of the expression with the maximum value. 

The program also correctly handles the possibility of the same maximum value for different expressions by printing the one that comes first in the list. This is because the `max` function returns the first maximum element it encounters in case of multiple maximum elements. Therefore, no additional checks or handling are needed to ensure this behavior. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
