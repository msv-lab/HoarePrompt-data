Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. It takes three space-separated real numbers as input, calculates the twelve expressions, finds the maximum value, and prints the corresponding expression. 

Here are some key points that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

1. **Input parsing**: The program uses `map(float, input().split())` to correctly parse the input into three floating-point numbers.

2. **Expression calculation**: The program calculates all twelve expressions as required, using the correct operator precedence for exponentiation.

3. **Finding the maximum**: The program uses a list to store the calculated expressions and finds the maximum value using the built-in `max()` function.

4. **Printing the result**: The program uses `a.index(max(a))` to find the index of the maximum value and prints the corresponding expression from the list `b`.

5. **Handling multiple maximums**: According to the problem description, if there are multiple maximums, the program should print the one that comes first in the list. The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value, which meets this requirement.

6. **Edge cases**: The program handles edge cases such as equal input values (e.g., 2.0 2.0 2.0) and small input values (e.g., 1.9 1.8 1.7) correctly.

Overall, the program is well-structured and correctly implements the required functionality, making it correct according to the problem description.
