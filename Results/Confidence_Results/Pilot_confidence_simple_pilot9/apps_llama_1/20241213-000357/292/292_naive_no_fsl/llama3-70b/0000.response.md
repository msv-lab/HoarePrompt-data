Correctness: **True**

This code is correct because it accurately implements the described problem logic. Here's why it works:

1. It reads the initial weights of Limak and Bob correctly from the input.
2. It uses a while loop to simulate the years passing, where in each year, Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled.
3. The loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.
4. Once Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's weight, the loop ends, and the number of years that have passed is printed.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, or where Limak becomes larger than Bob after just one year.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, when the input is 4 and 7, the code correctly outputs 2, because after one year, Limak's weight is 12 and Bob's weight is 14, and after two years, Limak's weight is 36 and Bob's weight is 28, so Limak becomes larger than Bob after two years.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem logic and handles all potential cases correctly, so it is correct.
