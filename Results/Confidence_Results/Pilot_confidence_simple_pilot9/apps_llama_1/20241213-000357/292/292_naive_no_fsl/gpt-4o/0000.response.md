Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It simulates the process of Limak and Bob gaining weight over the years, with Limak's weight tripling and Bob's weight doubling each year. The program continues to simulate this process until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, at which point it prints the number of years that have passed.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) from the input.
2.  **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`, which aligns with the problem's requirement that Limak must become strictly larger than Bob.
3.  **Weight Update**: Inside the loop, `a` is tripled and `b` is doubled, simulating the weight gain process described in the problem.
4.  **Year Counting**: The program correctly increments the `years` counter each time the loop iterates, effectively counting the number of years that pass until Limak becomes larger than Bob.
5.  **Output**: Once the loop exits, the program prints the `years` counter, which represents the number of full years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal initially. The provided example inputs (e.g., `4 7`, `4 9`, and `1 1`) demonstrate the program's correctness, as it produces the expected outputs for each scenario.

In the absence of any counterexamples or logical flaws, it can be concluded that the program accurately implements the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
