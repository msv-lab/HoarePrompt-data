Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c, by including all non-negative numbers in sequence b and all negative numbers in sequence c. Since the problem description allows every element to belong exactly to one of the sequences, and the goal is to maximize B - C, including all non-negative numbers in sequence b (which maximizes B) and all negative numbers in sequence c (which minimizes C and thus maximizes B - C) is the optimal strategy. 

In every case, this approach ensures that B - C is maximized, because adding a positive number to B increases B - C, adding a negative number to C decreases C and thus increases B - C, and adding a zero to either sequence does not change B - C. Therefore, the provided program is correct and will work for all potential cases. 

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input sequence, which is efficient given the constraints of the problem. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of lists to store the input sequence. 

Overall, the program is a simple, yet efficient solution to the given problem, and its logic correctly aligns with the problem description, ensuring that it will produce the maximum possible value of B - C for every valid input.
