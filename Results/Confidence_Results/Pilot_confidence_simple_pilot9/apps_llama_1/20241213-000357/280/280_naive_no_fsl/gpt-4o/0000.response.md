Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be a correct solution to the problem. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It reads the initial speed `v1`, final speed `v2`, time `t`, and maximum speed change `d` from the input.
2. It initializes an array `speeds` of size `t` to store the speed at each second.
3. It sets the initial speed `speeds[0]` to `v1` and the final speed `speeds[-1]` to `v2`.
4. It then iterates over the seconds from 1 to `t-1` and calculates the speed at each second. The speed is calculated as the minimum of the previous speed plus the maximum speed change `d`, and the final speed `v2` plus the maximum speed change `d` multiplied by the number of remaining seconds `t-i-1`. This ensures that the speed change between adjacent seconds does not exceed `d` and that the car reaches the final speed `v2` at the end of the time `t`.
5. Finally, it calculates the total distance traveled by summing up the speeds at each second and prints the result.

The program seems to handle all edge cases correctly, including when the initial and final speeds are the same, or when the maximum speed change `d` is 0. The examples provided in the problem description also match the output of the program.

After reviewing the code and trying to think of potential cases where it might not work as expected, I was unable to find any such cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
