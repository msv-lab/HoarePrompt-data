Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

One potential issue with the program is that it only checks for values of `t` less than `mid` down to 1 and greater than `mid` up to 100. However, the problem description does not restrict the value of `t` to be within the range of the given stick lengths.

To fix this issue, the program should check for all possible values of `t` that minimize the cost, not just the ones around the median of the stick lengths. 

Another issue is that the program calculates the cost by summing the minimum of `abs(x - i)` and `abs(x - (i + 1))` for each stick `x`, but this is not the correct way to calculate the cost. The cost should be the sum of the absolute differences between each stick's length and the target length `t`, with the possibility of moving the stick to either `t - 1` or `t + 1` if it is not already within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]`.

For example, if the stick lengths are `[1, 10, 4]`, the program may not find the correct solution because it only checks for values of `t` around the median of the stick lengths, which is 4. However, the correct solution is to set `t` to 3, which would result in a cost of 7 (1 becomes 2, 10 becomes 4, and 4 remains the same). 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
3
1 10 4
```

The program may output `(4, 6)` instead of `(3, 7)`, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
