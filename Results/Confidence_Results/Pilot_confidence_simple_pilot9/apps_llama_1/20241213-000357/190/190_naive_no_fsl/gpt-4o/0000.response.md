Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It iterates through all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100, calculates the total cost of changing the stick lengths to be almost good for each `t`, and keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the stick lengths are already almost good for some `t`, as seen in the second example provided in the problem statement. It also correctly calculates the minimum cost and prints the corresponding `t` value.

The logic of the program is sound, and it does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it fails to handle. The use of floating-point infinity to initialize `min_cost` ensures that the first calculated cost will always be less than it, and the program will correctly update `min_cost` and `best_t` as it iterates through the possible values of `t`.

Overall, the program is well-structured, and its logic is easy to follow. It correctly solves the problem as specified in the problem description, and it does not have any apparent errors or edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
