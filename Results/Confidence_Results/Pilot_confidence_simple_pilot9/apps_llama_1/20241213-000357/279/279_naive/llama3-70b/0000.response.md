Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b that needs to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.

The program simply counts the number of positions in the permutation p that are not equal to i + 1 and the number of zeros in the sequence b. However, this approach is not correct because it does not consider the actual cycles in the permutation and the effect of reversing the skewers.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 3 4 1
1 1 1 1
```
In this case, the program will output 3, but the correct answer is 0 because the given permutation and sequence already satisfy the condition that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.

A correct approach would involve finding the cycles in the permutation and checking if they are of length 1 or if the sequence b has an odd number of 1s. If the cycles are of length 1, it means that the skewers are not being rotated, and if the sequence b has an even number of 1s, it means that the skewers are being reversed an even number of times, which does not change the direction of the skewers.

To fix the program, we need to implement a cycle detection algorithm and check the parity of the number of 1s in the sequence b. Here is an example of a corrected program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0

    visited = [False] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            j = i
            while not visited[j]:
                visited[j] = True
                cycle.append(j)
                j = p[j] - 1
            if len(cycle) == 1:
                ans += 1
            elif sum(b[j] for j in cycle) % 2 == 0:
                ans += 1

    print(ans)
```
