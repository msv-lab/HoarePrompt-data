Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It simply removes the last digit of the number until it becomes divisible by 10^k. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of digits to be removed, as it does not consider the possibility of removing digits from the middle of the number.

A counterexample is when the input is 10203049 and k is 2. The program will remove the last digit (9) and then the next last digit (4), resulting in the removal of two digits. However, the correct answer is 3, as we can remove the digits 2, 0, and 4 to get the number 10009, which is not divisible by 10^2, but we can remove one more digit (0) to get the number 1009, which is also not divisible by 10^2, but we can remove one more digit (9) to get the number 100, which is divisible by 10^2.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to consider all possible ways of removing digits from the number, not just the last digit. This can be done using dynamic programming or a recursive approach.

Here's an example of how to modify the program to get the correct answer:

```python
def min_digits_to_remove(n, k):
    n = str(n)
    min_remove = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << len(n)):
        num = ''
        for i in range(len(n)):
            if (mask & (1 << i)):
                num += n[i]
        if num == '' or (num[0] == '0' and len(num) > 1):
            continue
        if int(num) % (10 ** k) == 0:
            min_remove = min(min_remove, len(n) - len(num))
    return min_remove

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = min_digits_to_remove(n, k)
    print(w)

func()
```

This modified program generates all possible masks for the digits of the number, removes the digits corresponding to the mask, and checks if the resulting number is divisible by 10^k. If it is, it updates the minimum number of digits to remove. Finally, it prints the minimum number of digits to remove.
