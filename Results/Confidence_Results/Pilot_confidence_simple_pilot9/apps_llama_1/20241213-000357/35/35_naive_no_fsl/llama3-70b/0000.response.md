Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example where it fails is when the input is 5 4 6. In this case, the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the conditions is 2, because he can put 2 pieces of the first cake on 2 plates and 3 pieces of the second cake on 3 plates. However, the program will output 1.

The problem with the program is that it doesn't consider all possible combinations of distributing the cakes. It only checks if it's possible to distribute x pieces of each cake to the plates, but it doesn't check if it's possible to distribute the remaining pieces to the remaining plates.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check all possible combinations of distributing the cakes. Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    for x in range(min(a, b, a // (n // 2), b // (n // 2)), 0, -1):
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i * x <= a and (n - i) * x <= b and i + (n - i) == n:
                print(x)
                return


func()
```

This program checks all possible combinations of distributing the cakes and prints the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the conditions.
