Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct and accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts with `curr_lat` set to 90, representing the North Pole, which matches the initial position described in the problem.

2. **Direction Handling**: The program correctly handles the update of `curr_lat` based on the direction of travel ('North' or 'South'). The conversion factor of 111.195 kilometers per degree is used to calculate the change in latitude, which is accurate for the assumptions made about the Earth's shape and size.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: It checks for cases where Limak might be at the North or South Pole and ensures that at these points, he can only travel in the allowed direction ('South' from the North Pole and 'North' from the South Pole). This is a direct implementation of the problem's conditions.

4. **Completion Condition**: The journey's end position is also correctly evaluated. The program checks if after all directions are followed, Limak ends up back at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`), which is a requirement for the journey to be considered valid.

5. **Intermediate Checks**: The program exits and prints 'NO' as soon as any of the conditions are violated, ensuring that it does not continue with an invalid journey. This includes checks for exceeding the Earth's bounds (`curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90`) and incorrect movements at the poles.

Given these implementations, the program should correctly evaluate any input based on the problem's requirements. Without being able to find a specific case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
