Correctness: **True**

The program works correctly because it tries all possible combinations of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and checks if the remaining amount of money can be spent on Bars bars. The loop `for x in range(n // a + 1):` generates all possible numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola that Vasya can buy. Then, the `if` statement checks if the remaining amount of money (`n - x * a`) can be spent on Bars bars, i.e., if it is a multiple of `b`. If it is, the program prints 'YES' and the numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that Vasya should buy. If the program tries all possible combinations and cannot find a way to spend exactly `n` burles, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all possible cases because it tries all possible numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola and checks if the remaining amount of money can be spent on Bars bars. The program does not miss any possible combinations because the loop generates all possible numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola that Vasya can buy, and the `if` statement checks all possible ways to spend the remaining amount of money on Bars bars.

The time complexity of the program is O(n/a), which is reasonable for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000). The space complexity is O(1), which means the program uses a constant amount of space.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient. It handles all possible cases and has a reasonable time complexity.
