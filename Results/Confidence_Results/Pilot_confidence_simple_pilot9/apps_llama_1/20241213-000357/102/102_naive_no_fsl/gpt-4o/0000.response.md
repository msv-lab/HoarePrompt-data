Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it iterates over all possible numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola (x) that can be bought with the given amount of money (n) and checks if the remaining amount of money can be spent on Bars bars (y). The program uses the modulo operator to check if the remaining amount of money is a multiple of the cost of a Bars bar, which is a correct approach to find the solution.

The program covers all possible cases, including the cases where x or y is 0, which are valid solutions according to the problem description. The program also handles the case where it is impossible to spend exactly n burles, in which case it prints "NO".

The program's algorithm is based on the following logic:

- For each possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola (x) from 0 to n/a (where a is the cost of a bottle of Ber-Cola), calculate the remaining amount of money (n - x * a).
- Check if the remaining amount of money is a multiple of the cost of a Bars bar (b). If it is, calculate the number of Bars bars (y) that can be bought with the remaining amount of money.
- If a solution is found (i.e., x * a + y * b = n), print "YES" and the values of x and y, and exit the program.
- If no solution is found after checking all possible values of x, print "NO".

The program's time complexity is O(n/a), which is efficient for the given constraints. The program's space complexity is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description.
