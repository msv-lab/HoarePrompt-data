Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided code is that the function `func_1` is called before it is defined. In Python, you need to define a function before you can use it. This will result in a `NameError` when trying to run the code.

The correct code should define the `func_1` function before the main logic of the program. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all inputs and find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It iterates over possible values of `m` and checks if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. As soon as it finds a non-prime number, it prints the corresponding value of `m` and stops.
