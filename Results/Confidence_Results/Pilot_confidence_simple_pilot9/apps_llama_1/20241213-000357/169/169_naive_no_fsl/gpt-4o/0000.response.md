Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem because it simply simulates the operations starting from 0 stones, whereas the problem asks for the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations. The program should actually consider all possible initial numbers of stones to find the minimum number of stones after operations.

For instance, consider the input "3 \n ---". If Vasya starts with 3 stones, he will end up with 0 stones after the operations. However, if the program starts simulating from 0 stones, it will not be able to perform the three operations of taking a stone. The correct approach would be to try different initial numbers of stones until it finds the minimum number of stones that allows all operations to be performed.

To fix this, the program should start with the minimum possible initial number of stones that would allow all operations of taking a stone to be performed and then adjust from there, as the goal is to minimize the final number of stones after operations. 

Here is a simple, correct implementation in Python:

```python
def min_stones():
    n = int(input())
    operations = input()
    min_stones = sum(1 for op in operations if op == '+')
    minus_count = operations.count('-')
    min_initial_stones = max(1, minus_count - operations.count('+'))
    result = max(0, min_initial_stones + operations.count('+') - operations.count('-'))
    return result

print(min_stones())
```
