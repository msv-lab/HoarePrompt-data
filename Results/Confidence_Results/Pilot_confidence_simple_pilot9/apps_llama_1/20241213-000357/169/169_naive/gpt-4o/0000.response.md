Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that Vasya has a pile of stones and performs n operations, which can either be taking one stone from the pile or adding one stone to the pile. The pile is non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. The task is to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

However, the provided program does not consider the fact that the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking one stone. It simply simulates the operations from the start, assuming an initial number of stones as 0, which may not be the case.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible initial numbers of stones and simulate the operations for each initial number, then return the minimum number of stones that can be achieved. 

Here's an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')
    for initial_stones in range(1, n + 1):
        stones = initial_stones
        for operation in s:
            if operation == '+':
                stones += 1
            elif operation == '-':
                stones -= 1
        if stones >= 0:
            min_stones = min(min_stones, stones)
    print(min_stones)
```
This program iterates over all possible initial numbers of stones and simulates the operations for each initial number. It keeps track of the minimum number of stones that can be achieved and returns this minimum number.
