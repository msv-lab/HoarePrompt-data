Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully checks every possible substring of the input string to see if it's a palindrome. If a substring is found that is not a palindrome, its length is compared to the current maximum length, and the maximum length is updated if necessary. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

- The code iterates over every possible substring of the input string `s`. This is done using two nested loops: the outer loop selects the start index `i`, and the inner loop selects the end index `j` for each substring.
- For each substring `substr` from `i` to `j`, it checks if `substr` is equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). If they are not equal, it means `substr` is not a palindrome.
- If a non-palindrome substring is found, its length is compared to the current `max_len`. If the length of the current substring is greater, `max_len` is updated.
- Finally, it prints `max_len` if any non-palindrome substrings were found; otherwise, it prints `0`.

This approach ensures that the program checks every possible substring and correctly identifies the longest non-palindrome substring(s) according to the problem description. The provided examples ("mew", "wuffuw", "qqqqqqqq") all produce the expected outputs, further confirming the program's correctness.
