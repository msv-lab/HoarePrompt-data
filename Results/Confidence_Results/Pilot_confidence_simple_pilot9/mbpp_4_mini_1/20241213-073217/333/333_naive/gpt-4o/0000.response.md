Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case of unbalanced expressions where the opening and closing brackets are not in the correct order. For example, the expression `'{(])}'` is not included in the assertions, but the program would return `True` for it. 

In this case, the character `']'` is not correctly paired with an opening bracket because it doesn't match the most recent opening bracket. The logic incorrectly checks the type of the last opened bracket and leads to an incorrect validation of the expression's balance. 

This demonstrates that the program has a flaw and does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every case.
