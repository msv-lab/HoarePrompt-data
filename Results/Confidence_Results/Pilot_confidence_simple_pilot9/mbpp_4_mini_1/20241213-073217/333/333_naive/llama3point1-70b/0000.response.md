Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks for balanced expressions containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and verifies that each closing bracket matches the most recently opened one. The algorithm handles all edge cases, including:

1. Expressions with no brackets (returns True).
2. Expressions where brackets are correctly nested (returns True).
3. Expressions where brackets are mismatched or improperly nested (returns False).

Since the program properly covers all scenarios specified in the problem description, I conclude it is correct.
