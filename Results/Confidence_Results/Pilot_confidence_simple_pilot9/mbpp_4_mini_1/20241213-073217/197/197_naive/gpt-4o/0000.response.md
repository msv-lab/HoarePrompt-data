Correctness: **False**. 

The program is supposed to count the occurrences of all elements specified in the `elements` list within the tuple `tup`. However, it fails to handle the case where `elements` contain an item that is not present in `tup`. 

For example, if we test the function with the following input:
```python
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['e']) == 0
```
The expected output should be `0` since 'e' does not appear in the tuple, but the program will still correctly return `0`, illustrating that it handles this case as anticipated. 

However, letâ€™s take a more complex example:
```python
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b', 'e']) == 3
```
In this case, it counts occurrences of 'a' (2 times) and 'b' (1 time), but disregards 'e' (0 times), again returning `3`. 

Thus, the function accurately counts occurrences and deals correctly with elements that do not exist in the tuple. Hence, it works correctly for such cases, and its implementation seems correct.

In conclusion, since all potential scenarios yield the expected outcomes based on the provided description and assertions, I confirm that the code behaves correctly for all provided inputs and beyond.

Correctness: **True**.
