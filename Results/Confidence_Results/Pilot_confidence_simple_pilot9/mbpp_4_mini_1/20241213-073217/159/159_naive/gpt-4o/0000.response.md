Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is intended to compute the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). However, there is a significant issue that arises when the inputs are invalid, such as non-positive values for the radius or height. The volume of a cone cannot be negative or zero when using realistic physical measurements. 

For instance:

1. If we call `func_1(0, 12)`, we should expect the volume to be `0` since a cone with a radius of `0` has no volume. 
2. If we call `func_1(-5, 12)` or `func_1(5, -12)`, these values do not make sense in the context of physical dimensions and should ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is invalid.

The function currently lacks handling for these edge cases, so it does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description in all potential scenarios. Thus, the program is incorrect.
