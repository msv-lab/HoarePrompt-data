To determine the correctness of the provided Python program for checking whether the given number is undulating, let's analyze both the problem description and the program code.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to check if a number is "undulating." An undulating number is typically defined as one where the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. For example, the number `121` is undulating (because 1 < 2 > 1), while `123` is not, as it follows a strictly increasing sequence.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **String Conversion**: The number is converted to a string which is appropriate for digit comparison.
2. **Looping through Digits**: The program iterates through each digit from index `1` to `len(n) - 2`.
3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - It checks if the current digit is part of an increasing or decreasing sequence.
4. **Undulating Check**: If it encounters any digit that disrupts the undulating pattern, it sets the `undulating` flag to `False`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The loop does not consider the first digit (`n[0]`) and the last digit (`n[-1]`). Thus, if there are only two digits (e.g., `12`), it would incorrectly identify them as undulating because there are no comparisons made.
   - If all digits are the same (e.g., `111`), the function will also incorrectly return `True` because the condition will never be violated.

### Counterexamples:
1. Input: `12` (Expecting: `True`, Actual Output: `True`, which is correct)
2. Input: `121` (Expecting: `True`, Actual Output: `True`, which is correct)
3. Input: `111` (Expecting: `False`, Actual Output: `True`, which is incorrect since `111` does not undulate)
4. Input: `123` (Expecting: `False`, Actual Output: `True`, which is incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The logic does not appropriately account for sequences of digits where no undulating pattern exists, particularly with digits that are the same or a strictly increasing/decreasing series. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
