Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input number has only 2 digits. The problem statement implies that undulating numbers must have alternating digits that are unequal, but the function incorrectly returns `False` for inputs with less than 3 digits. 

For example, the input `12` should be considered undulating, as it has two different digits and alternates. However, the program returns `False` for this case, which is incorrect per the typical understanding of "undulating" numbers.

Additionally, the function does not verify if the input number strictly alternates without any repetition after 2 digits when the length exceeds 2. 

Therefore, the provided function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
