To verify the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the problem requirements and the implementation:

### Problem Description:
The function should take a tuple of numbers and return a tuple where each element at index `i` is the product of the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` from the input tuple.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))

# Assertions
assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)
assert func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7)) == (8, 20, 30, 42)
assert func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15)) == (156, 182, 126, 135)
assert func_1((12,)) == ()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Tuple Size Constraints**:
   - The function needs to handle tuples of size 1 (`(12,)` yields an empty tuple `()`), which is correct since there are no pairs to multiply.
   - The function works properly for tuples of size greater than 1, as seen in the provided assertions.

2. **Product Logic Verification**:
   - For a given tuple of size `N+1`, the resulting tuple of size `N` should indeed consist of the product of each consecutive pair as described.
   - The assertions provided match the expected outputs, verifying the multiplication logic for the test cases.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - An edge case could be an empty tuple `()`, which is not handled explicitly in the code but since `len(()) - 1` will be `-1`, the range will be empty and will return an empty tuple. 

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly computes the required products for all potential inputs according to the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all examples considered, including handling the edge cases properly.
