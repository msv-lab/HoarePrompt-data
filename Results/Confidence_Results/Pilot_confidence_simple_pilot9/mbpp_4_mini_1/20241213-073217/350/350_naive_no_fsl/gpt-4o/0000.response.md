To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to check if it accurately finds the last position of an element in a sorted array.

### Analyzing the Program:

The function `func_1` is designed to iterate through the array `arr` from the end to the beginning. It checks if the current element matches `x`. If it finds a match, it returns the index. If the loop completes without finding `x`, it returns `-1`.

### Provided Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` should return `0`. 
   - This is correct because `1` is at index `0`.

2. **Test Case 2:** `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` should return `2`.
   - This is also correct since `1` appears last at index `2`.

3. **Test Case 3:** `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` should return `3`.
   - This is correct as the last `3` is indeed at index `3`.

### Additional Cases to Consider:

To ensure correctness, letâ€™s consider some edge cases not covered by the provided assertions:

1. **Edge Case - Element Not in Array:** 
   - If we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)`, we should expect a return value of `-1` because `4` is not in the array. The function handles this correctly.

2. **Edge Case - Last Element:** 
   - If we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 3], 3)`, we should expect a return value of `3` because `3` is at index `3`, which is also covered by the main logic.

3. **Edge Case - Empty Array:** 
   - If we call `func_1([], 1)`, it should return `-1` since there are no elements in the array. This case is handled correctly by the function.

### Conclusion:

After testing and analyzing the function against several cases, including possible edge cases, the function appears to be correct for every potential case that we've tested. It successfully meets the problem requirements of finding the last position of the element in a sorted array and handles various scenarios appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
