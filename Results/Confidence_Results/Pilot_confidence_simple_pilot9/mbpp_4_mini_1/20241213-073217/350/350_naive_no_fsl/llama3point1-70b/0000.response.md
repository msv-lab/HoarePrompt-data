To determine if the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze the provided function `func_1(arr, target)`:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the last position (index) of a given element (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). If the element is not found, the function should return -1.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) down to 0.
   - For each index, it checks if the current element is equal to the `target`.
   - If a match is found, it immediately returns the current index.
   - If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns -1.

3. **Correctness Checking**:
   - The function correctly identifies the last occurrence of `target` because it scans from the end to the beginning.
   - If `target` is found, it returns the first index that matches (which, due to the reverse iteration, is the last occurrence in the original array).
   - If `target` doesn't exist in the array, the function correctly returns -1.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is empty, the function should return -1, which it does.
   - If the target is not in the array, it returns -1 correctly.
   - If the target is present multiple times, it correctly returns the last index of that target.

After analyzing the logic and considering various edge cases, the function performs correctly in finding the last occurrence of the target in all potential scenarios.

Correctness: **True**  
The function is correct because it effectively finds the last position of an element in a sorted array, handling all specified cases properly, including empty arrays and scenarios where the target is not present.
