Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, and upon finding a match, it returns the index of that element. If the element isn't found, it appropriately returns -1. 

The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:
1. For the array `[1, 2, 3]` and the target `1`, it correctly returns `0`.
2. For `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` with `x` as `1`, it returns `2`, which is the last occurrence of `1`.
3. In the case of `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and the target `3`, it returns `3`, the last position of `3`.

Since I cannot think of any potential edge cases or examples where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.
