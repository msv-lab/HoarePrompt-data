Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. It takes a dictionary and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

### Explanation:
- The function `func_1` uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over all key-value pairs in the dictionary `d`.
- The condition `if v >= n` ensures that only those key-value pairs whose values are greater than or equal to `n` are included in the resulting dictionary.
- The function will work correctly for all integer values of `n`, including negative values, as the comparison will function properly in all numerical scenarios.

Additionally, edge cases such as:
- An empty dictionary will return an empty dictionary, which is correct.
- A dictionary with all values below `n` will also return an empty dictionary, adhering to the requirement.

Since there are no potential cases where the function fails to meet the specified behavior, the program is deemed correct.
