Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly filters the input dictionary `d` based on the condition that the values must be greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The use of dictionary comprehension ensures that only the key-value pairs meeting this condition are retained in the resulting dictionary.

Here is a breakdown of the test cases provided in the assertions:

1. For the input `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` with `n = 170`, the expected output is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`. The function correctly returns this filtered dictionary.

2. For the same input dictionary but with `n = 180`, the expected output is `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`. The function again correctly filters and returns this result.

3. Lastly, with `n = 190`, the expected output is `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`. The function successfully returns this as well.

Since all edge cases and different inputs lead to the expected outputs as per the problem description, the function is considered correct. The function is straightforward for the specified task and robust against different values of `n`. Thus all potential cases yield the correct behavior as described.
