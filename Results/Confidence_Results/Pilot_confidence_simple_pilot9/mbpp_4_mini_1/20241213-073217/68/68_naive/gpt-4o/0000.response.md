Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is designed to return the angle (or phase) of a complex number, but there is an issue with handling complex numbers that are real or purely imaginary:

1. The test cases use the imaginary part as either `1j` (which represents the imaginary number 1) or `2j`. However, there is no test for a purely real number, e.g., `func_1(3, 0)` or a purely imaginary number `func_1(0, -1j)`. 

2. For purely real numbers (e.g., `func_1(3, 0)`), the expected angle should be `0` radians. 

3. In the case of purely imaginary numbers where the imaginary part is negative, the phase should return `-Ï€/2` (or `-1.5707963267948966`), which is also not verified in the provided assertions.

Since there are test cases that are not covered, such as purely real and purely negative imaginary numbers, the function does not handle all potential edge cases as expected from the problem description. Thus, the implementation is incorrect for those cases, leading to False correctness.
