Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality of finding the ASCII value of a single character. The use of the `ord()` function is appropriate for converting a character into its ASCII integer value, and the function correctly specifies that it takes a string input that should be a single character. 

Given that the function does not specify what to do if the input is not a single character (e.g., if the input is an empty string or a string longer than one character), the assumption is that the input will always meet the requirement of being a single character as per the problem description. If the function is called with valid inputs, it will always return the correct ASCII value.

Thus, there are no potential edge cases in the context of the problem description that cause the function to fail; therefore, the function as described should work correctly for any single character input.
