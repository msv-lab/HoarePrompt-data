Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1`, which identifies even numbers from a list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list and checks if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., checks if it is even). The assertions provided also cover different cases, including various inputs:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
2. `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` correctly returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
3. `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` correctly returns `[8, 12]`.

These inputs demonstrate that the function accurately captures even numbers, including zero, and handles a variety of lists. No edge cases where the function would fail to correctly identify even numbers can be identified based on the implementation and the given test cases. Thus, the function works as intended across the provided examples, confirming its correctness against the problem description.
