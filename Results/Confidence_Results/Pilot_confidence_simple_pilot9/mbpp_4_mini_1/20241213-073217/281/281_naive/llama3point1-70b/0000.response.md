Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from the provided list of numbers. The use of a list comprehension with the condition `num % 2 == 0` ensures that only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers) are included in the output list. 

I've considered potential edge cases, such as:
- An empty list: it correctly returns an empty list.
- A list containing only odd numbers: it returns an empty list as well.
- A list with mix of even and odd numbers: it returns only even numbers.

Since the function works as intended for all cases I've considered, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
