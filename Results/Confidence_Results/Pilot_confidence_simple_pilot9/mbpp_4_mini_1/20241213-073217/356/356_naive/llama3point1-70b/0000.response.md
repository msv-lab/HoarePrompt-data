Correctness: **False**.

The provided program only removes spaces `' '` from the input string, but it does not handle other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`'\t'`), newlines (`'\n'`), and other Unicode whitespace characters. For example, if the input string is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the program would return `"HelloWorld\n"` instead of `"HelloWorld"`. This means it does not fulfill the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string. Therefore, it is incorrect.
