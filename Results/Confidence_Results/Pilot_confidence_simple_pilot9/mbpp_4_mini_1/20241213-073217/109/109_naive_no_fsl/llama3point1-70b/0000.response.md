To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze what the function is supposed to do and how it implements that logic.

**Problem Description:** The function should replace the last element of `list1` with all the elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it should assign `list2` to `list1`.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

1. **Non-empty `list1`:**
   When `list1` is not empty, the line `list1[-1:] = list2` is executed. This operation will slice `list1` such that it only retains the last element replaced with the entire `list2`. 
   - For instance, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 5]`, the result will be `list1 = [1, 2, 4, 5]`. 
   - The expected behavior according to the problem description is to replace the last element of `list1` (which is `3`) with the elements of `list2`. This part of the function does not correctly adhere to the problem description.

2. **Empty `list1`:**
   When `list1` is empty, the line `list1 = list2` is executed; however, this does not actually modify `list1` outside the function since lists are mutable, and assignment creates a new local reference. Thus, the original `list1` will remain unchanged, which contradicts the problem description.

**Example Cases:**
- If `list1 = [1, 2]` and `list2 = [3]`, the expected output is `[1, 3]`. However, the program will produce `[1, 2, 3]`, which is incorrect.
- If `list1 = []` and `list2 = [3, 4]`, the expected output is `[3, 4]`. The program will not produce this output because it returns the unchanged empty `list1`.

Given these observations, the program does not comply with the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
