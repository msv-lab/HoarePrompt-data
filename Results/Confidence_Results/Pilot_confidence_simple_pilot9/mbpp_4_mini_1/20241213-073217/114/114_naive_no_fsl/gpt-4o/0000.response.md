Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. It uses the `count` method, which is designed to return the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for the provided test cases:
1. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4)` returns `0` since `4` does not exist in the tuple.
2. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10)` returns `3`, which is the correct count of `10` in the tuple.
3. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8)` returns `4`, which accurately reflects the number of occurrences of `8`.

Given that the function correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple as required by the problem description, I cannot identify any inputs or edge cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, I conclude that this implementation is correct for all potential cases.
