Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method of tuples, which is the appropriate approach for this task. 

The assertions in the code also confirm that the function works as intended for the tested cases:
- It returns `0` when counting the occurrences of `4` (which is not in the tuple).
- It returns `3` for the element `10`, which appears three times in the tuple.
- It returns `4` for the element `8`, which is counted four times.

Since the function correctly handles these scenarios and there are no edge cases identified where it fails to meet the problem description, the function is confirmed to be correct.
