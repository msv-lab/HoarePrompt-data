To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the provided problem description, we need to consider various potential cases including edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The function should multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide this product by the length of the list.

### Analyzing the Program:
The function `func_1` multiplies all the numbers in the input list and then divides the product by the length of the list. 

### Potential Cases:
1. **Normal Case**: Frequent cases such as a list of positive numbers, for example:
   - Input: `[2, 3, 4]` 
   - Calculation: Product = `2 * 3 * 4 = 24`, Length = `3`, Result = `24 / 3 = 8`, which is correct.

2. **Including Zero**: If the list contains a zero, the product will be zero:
   - Input: `[2, 0, 4]`
   - Calculation: Product = `2 * 0 * 4 = 0`, Length = `3`, Result = `0 / 3 = 0`, which is also correct.

3. **Empty List**: An empty list should be evaluated. The program does not handle this case:
   - Input: `[]`
   - Length = `0`, which would lead to a division by zero when attempting to calculate `product / len(numbers)`. This will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

4. **Negative Numbers**: Including negative numbers should still return a valid output:
   - Input: `[-1, -2, -3]`
   - Calculation: Product = `-1 * -2 * -3 = 6`, Length = `3`, Result = `6 / 3 = 2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the edge case of an empty list, as it attempts to divide by zero, which is not allowable in mathematics and will raise an exception in Python. Hence, since it does not cater to all potential cases, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
