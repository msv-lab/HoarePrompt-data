Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from the list `nums` by returning only those numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0`. This means it checks if a number is not divisible by 2, which correctly identifies odd numbers.

To verify:

1. For an input like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `[1, 3]`, which includes all the odd numbers present in the list.
2. For an input like `[2, 4, 6]`, the function will return `[]`, which is correct because there are no odd numbers.
3. For an input of an empty list `[]`, it returns `[]`, which is also correct.
4. For negative numbers, such as `[-3, -2, -1]`, it returns `[-3, -1]`, which includes all the odd numbers.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail in filtering out odd numbers as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct in filtering odd numbers from any list of integers.
