Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly filters odd numbers from the list provided as input. The list comprehension used iterates over each number in `nums` and checks if it is odd by evaluating the condition `num % 2 != 0`. If the number is odd, it is included in the returned list. The program correctly handles all potential input cases, including an empty list or a list with only even numbers, and correctly returns the expected output in each scenario. Since there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, it is deemed correct.
