To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation step by step.

**Problem Description**: The function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

**Provided Program**:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function accepts a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples. 

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The line `zip(*tuples)` effectively transposes the tuples so that it groups corresponding elements together. For example, if the input were `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, `zip(*tuples)` would create the grouped pairs: `[(1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 6)]`.
   - The list comprehension then iterates over each group, calculating the sum of each group and dividing by the number of tuples to find the average.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input tuple is empty, `len(tuples)` will be 0, leading to a division by zero error. We need to check if the function handles this case explicitly.
   - If any of the inner tuples are empty (for example, `((1, 2), ())`), `sum(val)` for that group will also lead to incorrect behavior since the sum of an empty tuple should not contribute to the averaging.
   - If the lengths of the inner tuples differ (e.g., `((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`), `zip` will truncate the output to the shortest tuple, which may not be the intended behavior depending on the problem requirements.

### Testing:
1. **Empty Tuple Case**:
   ```python
   print(func_1(()))  # Expected: [] or appropriate handling of empty input
   ```

2. **Tuple with Empty Inner Tuple**:
   ```python
   print(func_1(((1, 2), ())) # Expected: Error or handling of empty tuple
   ```

3. **Inner Tuples of Different Lengths**:
   ```python
   print(func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))))  # Expected: Not defined behavior
   ```

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program does not handle edge cases, specifically division by zero when provided with an empty input or handling tuples of different lengths. As such, it fails to meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
