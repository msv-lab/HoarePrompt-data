To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the requirements in the problem description and the logic of the implemented function.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a Python function that takes a positive integer \( n \) and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. This means we need to consider the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{i}\) where \( i \) is even.

### Provided Program
```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum
```

### Analysis
1. **Understanding Binomial Coefficients**: The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{i}\) counts the number of ways to choose \( i \) elements from \( n \) elements without regard to the order. 

2. **Looping through Ranges**: The loop runs from \( 0 \) to \( n \) inclusive, which is correct since it needs to calculate all binomial coefficients from \( \binom{n}{0} \) to \( \binom{n}{n} \).

3. **Even Index Check**: The condition `if i % 2 == 0` correctly filters out the even indices. This means only coefficients at indices \( 0, 2, 4, \ldots \) are summed.

4. **Addition of Coefficients**: The use of `sum += math.comb(n, i)` correctly sums the binomial coefficients at even indices.

5. **Return Value**: The return statement correctly returns the total sum.

### Edge Case Check
Let's consider a specific case:

- If \( n = 1 \):
  - The binomial coefficients are:
    - \( \binom{1}{0} = 1 \) (even index)
    - \( \binom{1}{1} = 1 \) (odd index)
  
  The expected sum should be \( 1 \) (only the coefficient at index \( 0 \)). The program returns \( 1 \). 

- If \( n = 2 \):
  - The binomial coefficients are:
    - \( \binom{2}{0} = 1 \) (even index)
    - \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \) (odd index)
    - \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \) (even index)
  
  The expected sum should be \( 1 + 1 = 2 \). The program returns \( 2 \).

- If \( n = 3 \):
  - The binomial coefficients are:
    - \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) (even index)
    - \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) (odd index)
    - \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) (even index)
    - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (odd index)
  
  The expected sum should be \( 1 + 3 = 4 \). The program returns \( 4 \).

### Conclusion
After analyzing various values of \( n \) (including edge cases), the program behaves correctly for all tested inputs. There do not appear to be cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
