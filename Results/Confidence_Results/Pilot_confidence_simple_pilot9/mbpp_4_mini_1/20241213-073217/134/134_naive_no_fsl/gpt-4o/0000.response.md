To determine the correctness of the provided Python function against the problem description of calculating the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \), letâ€™s analyze the program step by step.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The function implemented in the program is:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

This function returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \) for a positive integer \( n \).

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \) is defined as:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
The even index binomial coefficients are those where \( k \) is even (0, 2, 4, ...).

### Checking Binomial Coefficients:
We can sum the even indexed binomial coefficients for some values of \( n \):
- For \( n = 4 \):
  - \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) + C(4, 4) = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \)
- For \( n = 6 \):
  - \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) + C(6, 6) = 1 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 32 \)
- For \( n = 2 \):
  - \( C(2, 0) + C(2, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

### Validation Against Program Output:
The expected results for the provided inputs are:
- \( func_1(4) \) should return 8.
- \( func_1(6) \) should return 32.
- \( func_1(2) \) should return 2.

The outputs from `func_1(n)` match these expected values. 

### Consider Insufficient Logic:
While the outputs for these specific cases are correct, we must investigate if the function can be generalized for all positive integers. The binomial theorem states:
\[
(1 + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k)
\]
The sum of the even indexed coefficients up to \( n \) is actually given by:
\[
\frac{1}{2} [(1 + 1)^n + (1 - 1)^n] = \frac{1}{2} [2^n + 0] = 2^{n-1}
\]
Thus the function does match the logic for the specified requirements for even indexed coefficients, as \( 2^{(n-1)} \) indeed gives the correct sum.

### Edge Cases:
For instance:
- If \( n = 1 \), the even index coefficients sum is \( C(1, 0) = 1 \). However, \( func_1(1) = 1 \), which is again correct.
- For negative integers or zero, the function should not be evaluated since the description specifically states positive integers.

### Conclusion:
Since I can confirm that for the defined cases the code works as expected and generalizes correctly as per the binomial coefficient logic without missing any critical scenarios related to positive integers, I conclude the overall correctness of the function.

Correctness: **True**  
The function correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients as described in the problem statement.
