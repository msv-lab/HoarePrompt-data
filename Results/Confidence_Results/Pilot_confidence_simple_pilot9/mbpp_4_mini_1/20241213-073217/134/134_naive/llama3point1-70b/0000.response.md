To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements:

### Problem Description:
Write a python function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Input Range**: The function is intended to take a positive integer `n`. This setup appears to ignore cases where `n` is zero or negative since such inputs were not specified in the problem description.

2. **Binomial Coefficients**: The function calculates the sum of all binomial coefficients `C(n, i)` for even indices `i`. The range runs from `0` to `n`. This is according to the requirement, as indices `0, 2, 4, ...` can be included if they are less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Summing Logic**: The program seems to correctly sum up the binomial coefficients for even indices. The condition `if i % 2 == 0:` effectively filters out the odd indices.

4. **Even Index Summation**: For example, if `n = 4`, the even index binomial coefficients would be:
   - `C(4, 0)`, `C(4, 2)`, and `C(4, 4)`, which adds to `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`.
   - This computation is correct and handles even indices as specified.

### Potential Issue:
The primary concern that stands out involves the handling of non-positive integers. The original problem statement states "positive integer," and while the function may be a sound implementation for valid positive integers, it does not account for what happens when `n <= 0`:
- If `n = 0` is provided, `math.comb(0, 0)` would return `1`, which could be considered a valid output (although `0` is not strictly positive).
- If a negative integer were input, the function would break, leading to an erroneous situation.

Since non-positive integers are not valid inputs but remain unhandled, the program violates the problem description's implicit contract regarding input validity.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not account for the requirement that `n` should be a positive integer, leading to undefined behavior for non-positive integers (e.g., negative values). A function that correctly handles the input specification is necessary to be deemed correct.
