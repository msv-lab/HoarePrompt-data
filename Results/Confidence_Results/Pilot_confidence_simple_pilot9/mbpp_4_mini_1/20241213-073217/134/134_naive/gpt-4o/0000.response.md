To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both.

### Problem Description
We need a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The even index binomial coefficients for a given `n` are typically represented by `C(n, 0)`, `C(n, 2)`, `C(n, 4)`, etc., and the sum of these coefficients should be computed.

### Provided Program
```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2
```

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Function**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`. 
   - For `n = 2`, it returns `2 ** (2 - 1) = 2 ** 1 = 2`, which matches the assert.
   - For `n = 4`, it returns `2 ** (4 - 1) = 2 ** 3 = 8`, which matches the assert.
   - For `n = 6`, it returns `2 ** (6 - 1) = 2 ** 5 = 32`, which matches the assert.

2. **Correct Calculation of Even Index Binomial Coefficients**:
   - The correct sum of even index binomial coefficients will be the sum of `C(n, 0)`, `C(n, 2)`, ..., which can be computed as `(1 + 1)^n = 2^n` divided by 2, leading to `2^(n-1)`.
   - This means that `func_1(n)` is correctly summing the even indexed binomial coefficients for positive integers `n`.

### Conclusion
All inputs provided in the assertions yield the expected results according to the problem description, and the logic applied in the function aligns with calculating the sum of even index binomial coefficients. Since I cannot find a case where the function does not fulfill the problem requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the sum of the even index binomial coefficients as specified in the problem description.
