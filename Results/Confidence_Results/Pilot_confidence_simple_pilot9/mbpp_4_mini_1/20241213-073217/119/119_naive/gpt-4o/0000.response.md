Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the described functionality of taking two numbers and returning them in a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. The provided assertions confirm that the function `func_1` behaves as expected for the test cases given. Additionally, since the function takes in any numerical values, there are no edge cases that would lead to incorrect behavior. Thus, it meets the problem requirements for all potential cases.
