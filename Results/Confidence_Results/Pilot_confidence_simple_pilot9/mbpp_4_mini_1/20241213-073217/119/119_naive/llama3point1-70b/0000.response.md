Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. It takes in two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number `b` coming first, followed by the first number `a`. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that cause the function to fail in fulfilling the requirement. For any inputs `(a, b)`, the output will always be `(b, a)`, conforming to the problem description. Thus, it behaves correctly for all possible numeric inputs, including negative numbers, zeros, and positive numbers.
