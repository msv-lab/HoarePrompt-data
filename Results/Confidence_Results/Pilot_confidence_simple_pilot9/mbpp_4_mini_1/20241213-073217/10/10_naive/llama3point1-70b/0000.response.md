Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the formula for the volume: 

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \]

In the function `func_1(b, h, l)`, the calculation is performed as follows:

- The area of the triangular base is calculated using `b * h / 2`.
- Then this result is multiplied by the length `l` of the prism (`* l`).

There are no missing edge cases or logic flaws in the function. It handles positive values for base, height, and length as expected, and it adheres to the requirements of the problem description for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. Thus, it is correct for all valid inputs.
