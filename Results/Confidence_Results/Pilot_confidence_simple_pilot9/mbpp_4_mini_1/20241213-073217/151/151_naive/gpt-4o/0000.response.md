Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the nested list, appending elements to a flat list when they are not lists and using recursion to handle elements that are lists. 

The examples provided in the assertions all produce the expected results for the function's behavior. Here are the detailed checks:

1. For the input `[0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]`, the function correctly flattens it to `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]`.
  
2. For the input `[[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]`, the function accurately flattens it to `[10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]`.

3. For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]`, the resulting flat list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]`, which is correct.

No edge cases or scenarios were found during the assessment that would result in incorrect output, such as empty lists or deeper levels of nesting, which the function handles appropriately.

Thus, the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
