Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to extract the rear index (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The logic used in the function `func_1` is straightforward and involves a list comprehension that successfully retrieves the last character of each string in the tuple. 

The assertions provided also validate that the function works correctly for multiple cases:
- For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, it correctly returns `['s', 'r', 's']`.
- For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, it returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`.
- For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, it returns `['a', 't', 'o']`.

Moreover, the function handles the edge case of an empty tuple gracefully, returning an empty list, which is the expected behavior. There are no evident missing logic cases or edge conditions not handled by the implementation.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
