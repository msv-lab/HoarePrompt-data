Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to extract the last character (rear index element) from each string in a given tuple. The use of `s[-1]` correctly accesses the last character of each string. 

Here are the potential edge cases:

1. If the input tuple contains empty strings, the function would raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the last index of an empty string.
2. If the input tuple is empty, it would return an empty list, which is reasonable and valid as there are no strings to extract from.
3. If the strings contain special characters or numbers, the function will still return the last character correctly.

Given the requirement in the problem description, the function does not handle the case of empty strings correctly. For instance, if the input is `("", "hello", "world")`, this would raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the last character of the first string.

Therefore, since there is at least one case where the function does not work as expected, the conclusion is: 

Correctness: **False**
