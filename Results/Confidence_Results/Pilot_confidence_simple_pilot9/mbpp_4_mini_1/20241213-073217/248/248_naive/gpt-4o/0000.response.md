Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. It successfully handles various inputs, including edge cases such as an empty list or lists containing mixed data types. Each call to the function as demonstrated in the assertions produces the expected tuple output based on the given list. Since I cannot identify any input where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
