To analyze the given problem description and program, we first clarify what the Lucas numbers are: 

The Lucas numbers are similar to Fibonacci numbers but start with 2 and 1:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

Now, let's assess the provided program:

```python
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

Now let's check the correctness of this implementation by deriving various cases:

1. **Base Cases**:
    - `func_1(0)` should return `2` (correct).
    - `func_1(1)` should return `1` (correct).

2. **Calculating Higher Values**:
    - `func_1(2)` should return `L(2) = 2 + 1 = 3` (this case is not covered in the assertions; an additional check shows it returns `3`, which is correct).
    - `func_1(3)` should return `L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4` (correct, assertion is valid).
    - `func_1(4)` should return `L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7` (correct, assertion is valid).
    - `func_1(5)` should return `L(5) = L(4) + L(3) = 7 + 4 = 11` (not covered by asserts, but function yields `11` which is correct).
    - `func_1(6)` should return `L(6) = L(5) + L(4) = 11 + 7 = 18` (function yields `18`, correct).
    - `func_1(7)` should return `L(7) = L(6) + L(5) = 18 + 11 = 29` (function yields `29`, correct).
    - `func_1(8)` should return `L(8) = L(7) + L(6) = 29 + 18 = 47` (function yields `47`, correct).
    - `func_1(9)` should return `L(9) = L(8) + L(7) = 47 + 29 = 76` (assertion valid).

Considering these checks, the function successfully computes the Lucas number for all relevant cases mentioned in the problem. There are no failing inputs that contradict the output of the function compared to the Lucas sequence definition.

Since the program adheres to the problem description without missing any potential edge cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
