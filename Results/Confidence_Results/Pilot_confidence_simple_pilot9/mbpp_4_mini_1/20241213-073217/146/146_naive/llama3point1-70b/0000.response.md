Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_len` will raise a `ValueError` because the `max()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
