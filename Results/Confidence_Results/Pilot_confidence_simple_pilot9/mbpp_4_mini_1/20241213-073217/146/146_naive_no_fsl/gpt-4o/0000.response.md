To determine the correctness of the provided Python program `func_1`, which is intended to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, let's analyze its logic and consider edge cases.

The function `func_1` iterates through a list of lists, keeps track of the maximum length encountered so far, and stores the corresponding list. The function returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

Here are the assertions given in the program:
1. `func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])` returns `(3, [13, 15, 17])`
2. `func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]])` returns `(4, [10, 12, 14, 15])`
3. `func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]])` returns `(3, [15, 20, 25])`

Let's analyze the program with potential edge cases:

- **Empty Input:** If we call `func_1([])`, this case should be handled explicitly. The function currently returns `(0, [])`, which is logical behavior for an empty input, but it is not explicitly tested in the assertions.

- **Multiple Lists with the Same Maximum Length:** If the input is `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])`, it returns `(2, [5, 6])`, which correctly returns the last list of the longest length. However, it does not specify which occurrence of the longest list to return if there are ties.

- **Negative and Mixed Values:** If the input is `func_1([[1], [-1, -2], [0]])`, the program will return `(2, [-1, -2])`, which is working correctly for negative values as length calculation doesn't depend on value signs.

- **Nested Empty Lists:** A case like `func_1([[], [], []])` will return `(0, [])`, which is acceptable.

The function seems to behave correctly for the above test cases and adheres to the requirements of the problem description, however, it lacks tests for edge cases such as when there are multiple lists of the same maximum length, which can lead to ambiguity.

Thus, while the function handles a number of important scenarios, it is missing clear requirements or behavior for multiple lists of the same maximum length and it does not handle an empty input explicitly. 

Correctness: **False**
