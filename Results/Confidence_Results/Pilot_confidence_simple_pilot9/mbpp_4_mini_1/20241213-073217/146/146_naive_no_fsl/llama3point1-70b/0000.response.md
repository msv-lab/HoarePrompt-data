Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description, which states to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The issue arises in the case where there are multiple lists of maximum length. The program only returns the first one it finds (`max_sublists[0]`), rather than the full list of maximum length sublists.

For example, consider the input:
```python
func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])
```
This input has two sublists of maximum length: `[3, 4, 5]` and `[6, 7, 8]`. The provided function will only return the first one, which is `[3, 4, 5]`, along with its length (3). According to the problem description, if there are multiple lists of maximum length, the program should return all of them, not just one.

Thus, the function does not produce the correct result for cases where multiple maximum length sublists exist.
