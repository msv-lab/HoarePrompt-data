Correctness: **False**

The provided implementation does not account for leading or trailing spaces in the strings when sorting. Hereâ€™s an example where the code fails:

Given the input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`, the expected sorted output should be:

1. The first sublist should be `[' red ', 'green']` (remains the same since ' red ' is sorted before 'green' with the leading space).
2. The second sublist should ideally be `[' black', 'blue ']` (since ' black' comes before 'blue ' when considering the leading space).
3. The third sublist should be `[' brown', ' orange']` (as ' brown' comes before ' orange' based on the leading space).

However, the assertion in the original code expects:

```python
[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
```

This issue arises because the sorting mechanism does not properly handle the spaces before the strings. Due to this inability to sort strings appropriately when accounting for whitespace, the implementation fails to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the output of the program does not align with every case outlined in the problem description.
