To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

### Problem Description:
The problem requires writing a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function takes `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list containing sublists of strings.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`.
3. For each `sublist`, it sorts the strings in the sublist using `sorted()`, with a custom sort key of `str.lower`, ensuring case-insensitive sorting.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- An empty list of lists: `func_1([])` should return `[]`.
- A list with empty sublists: `func_1([[], []])` should return `[[], []]`.
- A sublist containing mixed case strings: `func_1([['banana', 'Apple', 'cherry']])` should return `[['Apple', 'banana', 'cherry']]`.
- A sublist with only one element: `func_1([['single']])` should return `[['single']]`.
- A sublist with duplicates: `func_1([['apple', 'banana', 'apple']])` should return `[['apple', 'apple', 'banana']]`.

Considering these examples, the code handles each case correctly:
- It returns an empty list for an empty input.
- It retains empty sublists.
- It correctly sorts sublists with mixed case.
- It handles single-element sublists as expected.
- It sorts duplicates appropriately.

Since I could not find any circumstance where the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner and handles various edge cases as expected.
