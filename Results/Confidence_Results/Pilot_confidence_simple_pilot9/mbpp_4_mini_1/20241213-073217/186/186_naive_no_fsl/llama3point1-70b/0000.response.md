To determine the correctness of the provided function against the problem description, we need to analyze what the function is intended to do. Based on the problem statement, we are to extract element-wise operations from two tuples.

The function `func_1` is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

This function uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) on each pair of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Here are a few points to consider for correctness:

1. **Tuple Lengths**: The function uses `zip`, which will take the shortest of the two input tuples. If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, the function will only process elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. This means that information from the longer tuple is ignored, which may not be the desired behavior based on the problem description.

2. **Data Type Requirement**: The bitwise AND operator is generally used with integers. If either of the tuples contains non-integer values (e.g., strings, lists), the function will raise a `TypeError`. The problem description does not specify that both tuples must exclusively contain integers.

### Example Cases:
- **Case with Different Lengths**:
  ```python
  tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
  tup2 = (4, 5)
  # Result: (1 & 4, 2 & 5) => (0, 0)
  # The third element of tup1 is ignored.
  ```

- **Case with Non-Integer Types**:
  ```python
  tup1 = (1, 'a')
  tup2 = (2, 3)
  # This will raise a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'int' and 'str'
  ```

### Conclusion:
Given that the function fails to handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths and does not enforce the type of elements within the tuples, the program does not meet the correctness criteria outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function can result in incorrect behavior or exceptions depending on the input tuples, which does not align with the expectation of correctly handling all potential cases.
