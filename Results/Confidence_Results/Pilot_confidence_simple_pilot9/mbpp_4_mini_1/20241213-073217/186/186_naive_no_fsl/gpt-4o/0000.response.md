To evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the expected behavior based on the provided assertions.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that the function should extract element-wise operations from the two given tuples. Based on the assertions given:
1. `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
3. `assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`

### Function Implementation
The implementation of `func_1` is as follows:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```
The function takes two tuples, zips them together, and applies the bitwise AND (`&`) operation on each pair of corresponding elements from the two tuples. Finally, it returns a new tuple containing the results of these operations.

### Validation Against Assertions
1. For the first assertion:
   - Elements: `10 & 5 = 0`, `4 & 2 = 0`, `6 & 3 = 2`, `9 & 3 = 1` -> Correctness: `(0, 0, 2, 1)`
2. For the second assertion:
   - Elements: `1 & 5 = 1`, `2 & 6 = 2`, `3 & 7 = 3`, `4 & 8 = 0` -> Correctness: `(1, 2, 3, 0)`
3. For the third assertion:
   - Elements: `8 & 7 = 0`, `9 & 13 = 9`, `11 & 14 = 10`, `12 & 17 = 0` -> Correctness: `(0, 9, 10, 0)`

### Testing Edge Cases
- We need to consider scenarios such as:
  - Empty tuples: `func_1((), ())` which should return `()`.
  - Tuples with different lengths: `func_1((1, 2), (3,)) which should raise an error or return an unexpected output since zipping will only process up to the length of the shortest tuple.
  - Negative integers and zero values.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the function against the assertions and considering edge cases:

- The function does not handle the case when input tuples have different lengths and thus will not return the correct result or may raise an error.
- It also does not define how to handle empty tuples, which could lead to an inadvertent output.

As the program does not handle all potential cases as required, the Correctness is **False**.
