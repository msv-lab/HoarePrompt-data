To verify the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we first need to clarify the requirements.

**Problem description:** Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

**Analysis:**
- The function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`.
- It uses `zip` to pair up corresponding elements from both tuples and then performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on each pair.
- The result is returned as a new tuple.

**Potential cases to consider:**
1. Tuples of different lengths: The program does not handle cases where `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths. `zip` stops at the shortest tuple, potentially leading to missing elements from the longer tuple.
    - Example: 
      - `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)`
      - `tup2 = (4, 5)`
      - The result would be `(1 & 4, 2 & 5)` which is `(0, 0)`, but `3` from `tup1` is ignored.
2. Tuples containing non-integer values: The program performs a bitwise AND operation, which is only valid for integers. If any element in the tuples is a non-integer, it will raise a TypeError.
    - Example:
      - `tup1 = (1, 2, 'a')`
      - `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`
      - This would lead to an error since `'a' & 4` is invalid.

Considering these cases, the program incorrectly processes tuples of different lengths and does not account for non-integer elements.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly operate under certain input conditions where the lengths of the tuples differ and when non-integer elements are present. Such cases demonstrate that the program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential inputs.
