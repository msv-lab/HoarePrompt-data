Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where sublists may be empty. For example, if the input is `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])`, the program will attempt to access `sublist[0]` of the first empty sublist, which will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, this case is not handled by the provided code, making the implementation incorrect.
