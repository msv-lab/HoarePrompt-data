Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` is designed to return the first element of each sublist from a list of sublists. However, it does not account for cases where a sublist is empty. For instance, if we test the function with the input `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`, the function will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access `sublist[0]` for the empty sublist. Therefore, the implementation does not handle potential edge cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
