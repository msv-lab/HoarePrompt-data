To determine if the program is correct based on the provided problem description, we will analyze the code step by step to see if it correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. It combines the two lists, sorts them, and then attempts to find the median.

1. **Merging the two lists** - The function merges `list1` and `list2` and sorts the combined list. This approach is fundamentally correct as it allows us to find the median.

2. **Determining the median** - The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which does not seem correct. This is because to find the median in a merged list of size `2 * size`, you would need to consider the indices from `0` to `2*size - 1` (pairs of size). The correct middle indices for a list of even size would be `size - 1` and `size`, not `size - 1` and `size + 1`.

3. **Handling even and odd sizes** - The code is supposed to handle both even and odd cases, but the provided code only tests for `size % 2 == 0`. Given that both lists are the same size and merging them results in an even total size, the odd case is irrelevant here and is not handled properly in context.

For example, consider the following input where both lists are:
- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- `size = 2`

Here, when merged, `merged_list` should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The correct median should then be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

However, due to the logic in the program:
- It calculates `middle_index = 2 - 1 = 1`
- It checks if `size` is even, which it is, and wrongly calculates: `median` as `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2`, which gives `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is correct in this specific case but fails to handle general logic properly as mentioned above.

Now consider:
- `list1 = [1]`
- `list2 = [2]`
- `size = 1`

In this case:
- Merged list is `[1, 2]` and should calculate median as (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
- The code miscalculates `middle_index` and yields incorrect results.

Thus, there are scenarios where the logic of `middle_index` and median calculation based on its value lead to incorrect conclusions.

Due to these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the median for inputs where both lists are of the same size, resulting in "Correctness: **False**".
