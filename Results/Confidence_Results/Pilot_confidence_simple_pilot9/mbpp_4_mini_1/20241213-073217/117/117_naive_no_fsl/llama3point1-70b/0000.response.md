Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list. It uses the `isinstance()` function to check if each element `x` in the list `lst` is of type `int`. The expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` generates a boolean value for each element in the list, and `sum()` counts the `True` values (which correspond to integers).

Here are a few examples to confirm correctness:

1. For the input `lst = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 4.5]`, the program returns `3`, as there are three integers: `1`, `2`, and `3`.
2. For the input `lst = []`, the program returns `0`, correctly indicating that there are no integers.
3. For the input `lst = [None, True, 0, -1]`, the program returns `2`, as `0` and `-1` are integers.

Since all examples I've considered lead to the expected output, the program behaves correctly for all potential cases based on the given problem description.
