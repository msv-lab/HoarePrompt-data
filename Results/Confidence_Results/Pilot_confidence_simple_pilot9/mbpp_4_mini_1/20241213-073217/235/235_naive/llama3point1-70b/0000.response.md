Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It does this by:

1. Converting the integer `n` to its string representation using `str(n)`, which allows iteration over each digit.
2. Using a generator expression to convert each character back to an integer and sum them up with the `sum()` function.

In all cases of non-negative integers (including 0), this program performs correctly. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would lead to incorrect behavior based on the problem description. Since there are no scenarios where the function fails to meet the requirements, the function is correct.
