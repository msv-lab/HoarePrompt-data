Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It utilizes a while loop to extract each digit by taking the remainder of the number when divided by 10 (`n % 10`), adds that digit to the total, and then removes the last digit of the number by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`). 

The provided assertions also correctly test the function with various non-negative integers, yielding the expected results:

- For `345`, the sum of digits is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
- For `12`, the sum of digits is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- For `97`, the sum of digits is `9 + 7 = 16`.

Since there are no inputs specified in the problem description that the implementation fails to handle (e.g., negative integers or non-integer inputs), the implementation appears to correctly adhere to the specified problem requirements for the inputs considered.
