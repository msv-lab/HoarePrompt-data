Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case of the input being zero. According to the problem description, it should sum the digits of a non-negative integer, and the correct output for `func_1(0)` should be `0`. However, the program does not include a test case for this input, so we cannot confirm that it produces the expected result. Without a case for `0`, the program may indeed fail to handle this specific potential input correctly, hence it does not meet the requirements for correctness in every potential case.
