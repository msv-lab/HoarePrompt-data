Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where 'z' appears along with other characters, specifically at the start or the end of a word. According to the problem description, 'z' should be found anywhere in the word except for the first and last character. 

For example, consider the input string `"zoo"`. The program will return `False`, but it should return `False` because 'z' is the first character and should not be counted. However, if the input string is `"abzcd"`, the program will return `True` since 'z' is present in the middle, which matches with the description.

However, there are specific cases I can mention that this program does not meet:

1. An input of a single word like `"zza"` should return `False`, because 'z' is at the start and end.
2. An input of `"azb"` should return `True`, but the program currently behaves as expected in this case. 

Although the second case works correctly, the overall logic of checking multiple words is misleading since it does not establish a boundary check explicitly for edge cases. Thus, there can be multiple scenarios where responses can diverge from expectations.

Since the program's behavior can lead to incorrect assessments of when 'z' is appropriately placed, the program does not implement the required logic correctly. Thus, this inconsistency leads to the conclusion that the code is incorrect based on the requirements given in the problem description.
