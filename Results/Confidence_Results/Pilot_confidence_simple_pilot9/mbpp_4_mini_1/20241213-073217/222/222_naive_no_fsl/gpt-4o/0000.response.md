Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove all lowercase substrings from the given string. It does this by iterating over each character in the input string and keeping only the uppercase characters. The provided assertions confirm that it behaves as expected for various test cases:

1. For the input 'PYTHon', the lowercase 'on' is removed, resulting in 'PYTH'.
2. For the input 'FInD', the lowercase 'n' is removed, resulting in 'FID'.
3. For the input 'STRinG', the lowercase 'in' is removed, resulting in 'STRG'.

Since the function filters the input string by retaining only uppercase letters, it correctly fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description. No potential edge cases or missed logic are apparent. Thus, the function is deemed correct.
