Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the given month number has 31 days or not. It maintains a list of months that contain 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December, represented by their respective month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and checks if the input month number `n` is present in that list. 

Given any valid month number (1 through 12), the function will correctly return `True` for the months with 31 days and `False` for the others (February, April, June, September, November). 

For instance:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February does not have 31 days).
- `func_1(4)` returns `False` (April does not have 31 days).
- `func_1(12)` returns `True` (December has 31 days).

The code handles all relevant cases for valid month inputs, and there is no identified edge case where the program fails to fulfill the specified requirement. Thus, the program is correct.
