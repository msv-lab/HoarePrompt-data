To determine the correctness of the Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(n)` and its behavior.

### Problem Description 
The function is supposed to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The even natural numbers are generated using the formula `2 * i` for `i` starting from 1 upwards.

### Program Analysis
1. **Function Definition**: 
   The function is defined as:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
       cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
       return cube_sum
   ```

2. **Logic Breakdown**:
   - `even_numbers` is a list comprehension that generates the first `n` even natural numbers. For `n=2`, it would yield `[2, 4]`, for `n=3`, it would yield `[2, 4, 6]`, and for `n=4`, it would yield `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
   - The cube of each even number is calculated using `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` and summed up to give the `cube_sum`.
   
3. **Verification of Example Assertions**:
   - For `n=2`: `even_numbers = [2, 4]`, thus `cube_sum = 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`. This matches the first assertion.
   - For `n=3`: `even_numbers = [2, 4, 6]`, thus `cube_sum = 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`. This matches the second assertion.
   - For `n=4`: `even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]`, thus `cube_sum = 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`. This matches the third assertion.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **n=0**: The function does not explicitly handle `n=0`. If `n=0`, `even_numbers` would be an empty list, and the sum of cubes would be `0`, which may or may not be expected based on the problem description.
- **Negative n**: Passing a negative value for `n` would lead to an empty list generation, hence returning a sum of `0`. This could also be considered an edge case, but typically, the context of natural numbers does not allow negative indices.

### Conclusion
Although the function works correctly for the provided assertions, it lacks handling for edge cases such as negative input or `n=0`. Since it does not cover every potential case as required by the problem description, the correctness of the program is affected.

Correctness: **False**
  
The program fails to correctly handle the case when `n=0`, where it potentially could return an undesired output for the cube sum of "first 0 even numbers".
