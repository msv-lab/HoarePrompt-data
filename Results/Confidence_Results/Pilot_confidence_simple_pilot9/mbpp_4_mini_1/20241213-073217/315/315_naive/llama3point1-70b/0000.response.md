Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that the function should add a given tuple to a given list. However, the implementation `input_list + list(input_tuple)` does not modify the original list but instead returns a new list that is the result of adding the two together. This could be an issue if the goal is to modify `input_list` in place.

Consider the following case: 

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (4, 5)
result = func_1(my_list, my_tuple)
print(my_list)  # Expected output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if modified in place
print(result)   # Should show the new list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this case, `my_list` remains unchanged, which indicates that the implementation does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases. This shows that the function does not meet the modification expectation specified by the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
