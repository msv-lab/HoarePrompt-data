Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula holds for all values of degrees, including both positive and negative values. 

For example:
- If `deg` is 180, the function will return \( 180 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \pi \).
- If `deg` is 0, the function will return \( 0 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = 0 \).
- If `deg` is -90, the function will return \( -90 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = -\frac{\pi}{2} \).

In all these cases and others, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements can be identified.
