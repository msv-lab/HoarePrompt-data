Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\text{degrees} \times \pi}{180} \). This implementation satisfies the problem description to convert degrees to radians.

To verify its correctness, consider the following examples:
- For an input of 0 degrees, the output should be \( 0 \) radians, and the program returns `0.0`.
- For an input of 90 degrees, the output should be \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians, and the program returns approximately `1.5707963267948966`, which is correct.
- For an input of 180 degrees, the output should be \( \pi \) radians, and the program returns approximately `3.141592653589793`, which is also correct.

The formula used works for both positive and negative inputs as well, and it will adhere to mathematical principles for converting degrees to radians.

Additionally, since the problem description does not specify any constraints or limitations on the input value, the function should be considered robust for any numerical input (including floats). Therefore, I did not find any potential cases where the function does not work as expected.
