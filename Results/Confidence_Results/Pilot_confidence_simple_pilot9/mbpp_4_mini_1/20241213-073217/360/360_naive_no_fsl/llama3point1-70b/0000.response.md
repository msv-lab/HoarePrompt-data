Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies and returns the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. It uses the built-in `max()` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which effectively determines the list with the highest sum. 

The function will handle various cases appropriately, including:

1. **Single List**: It will return that list as it is the only candidate.
2. **Empty Lists**: If empty lists are present, the behavior of `max()` will raise a `ValueError`, but it doesn't violate the original problem description because it doesn't specify behavior for such cases, usually assuming non-empty inputs.
3. **Negative and Positive Numbers**: The function can correctly evaluate lists containing negative, positive, or mixed numbers to identify the one with the highest overall sum.
4. **Ties**: If there are multiple lists with the same maximum sum, `max()` will return the first one it encounters.

Since I cannot find a case where the code fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the code is correct.
