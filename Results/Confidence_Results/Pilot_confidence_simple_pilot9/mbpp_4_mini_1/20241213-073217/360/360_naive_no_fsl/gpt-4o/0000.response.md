Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find and return the sublist with the highest sum of its elements from a given list of lists. 

**Explanation:**
1. The variable `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity to ensure that any sum of a sublist will be larger.
2. The program iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the current sum, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` accordingly if the current sum exceeds the previous maximum.
3. Finally, it returns the sublist with the highest sum.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected under various scenarios. 

I cannot find an input or edge case where this implementation would fail given the problem description. Thus, the function is correct as it meets the specifications outlined.
