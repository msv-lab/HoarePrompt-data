Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether a given month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) has 30 days or not. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are accurately listed in the `thirty_days_months` array. The check `return month in thirty_days_months` correctly returns `True` if the input month is one of those numbers and `False` otherwise. 

Since all possible inputs (from 1 to 12) are accounted for, and the function produces the correct result for each, the program is correct.
