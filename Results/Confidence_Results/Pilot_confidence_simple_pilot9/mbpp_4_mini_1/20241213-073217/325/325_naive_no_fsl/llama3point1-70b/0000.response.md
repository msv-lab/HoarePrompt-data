Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the edge case of invalid month numbers. According to the problem description, the function should check whether the given month number (from 1 to 12) has 30 days. However, the function will return `False` if an invalid month number (e.g., 0 or 13) is passed, effectively treating those cases as if they had 30 days, which is incorrect behavior.

For example:

- Input: `0` (invalid month) → The function returns `False`, but it should ideally handle this case as invalid input.
- Input: `13` (invalid month) → The same issue as with input `0`.

The function does not handle inputs outside the range of 1 to 12. Therefore, there exists potential cases where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description.
