Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from the given two lists. It does this by converting both lists into sets and then using the intersection operator `&` to find common elements. The resulting shared elements are then sorted and returned as a tuple. 

All assertions provided in the program correctly validate that the function performs as expected and returns the correct shared elements for each test case. Since I cannot find any input or potential case where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
