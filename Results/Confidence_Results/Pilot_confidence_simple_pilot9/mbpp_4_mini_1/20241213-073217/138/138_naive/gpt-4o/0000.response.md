Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements a function that checks if an element is present in an array and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating presence and the index of the element. The use of `enumerate` allows for simultaneous iteration over the index and value of the elements in the array. The function effectively returns `(True, index)` if the element is found, and `(False, -1)` if it is not. The provided assertions confirm that the function works for specific test cases provided in the description, and no edge cases or logical errors were identified.
