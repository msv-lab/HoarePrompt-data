Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element as inputs, checks for the presence of the element in the array, and returns a tuple that indicates whether the element is found (True/False) and its index in the array (or -1 if not found). 

Let's break down the components:

1. **Element Found:** If the element exists in the array, `array.index(element)` returns the index of the first occurrence of the element. The function then returns `(True, index)`, which meets the requirement.

2. **Element Not Found:** If the element does not exist in the array, a `ValueError` is raised when calling `array.index(element)`, which the function catches. In this case, it returns `(False, -1)`, also as specified in the requirements.

3. **Edge Cases:** The code handles:
   - An empty array, returning `(False, -1)` since there are no elements to find.
   - An element that occurs multiple times, returning the index of the first occurrence.
   - Different data types (as long as the element to be found is of the same type as the items in the array).

Given that there are no identified edge cases or scenarios where the implementation deviates from the requirement, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Thus, the code is accurate and works as intended for all potential input cases.
