Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

- The function takes an array `arr` and an element `element`.
- It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which gives both the index and the value.
- If a match is found (i.e., if `value == element`), it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
- If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)` indicating that the element is not found in the array.

The function has been tested with multiple assertions that all produce the expected results, indicating correct behavior for those cases.

Moreover, edge cases like an empty array or the element not being present at all are handled correctly:

1. If the input array is empty, it returns `(False, -1)`, which is the expected behavior.
2. For any element not present in the array, it correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

Since all tested cases and edge cases conform to the problem description, the function is correct.
