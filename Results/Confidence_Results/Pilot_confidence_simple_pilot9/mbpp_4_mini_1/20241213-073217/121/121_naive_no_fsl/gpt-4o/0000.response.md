Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to compute the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number. However, the implementation does not actually calculate the NSW primes; instead, it simply generates a sequence based on a recurrence relation that does not correspond to the definition of NSW primes.

Here are two counterexamples that demonstrate the program's incorrectness:

1. The function should return the 2nd NSW prime, which is 3, but the recursive calculation fails to produce this value:  
   `func_1(2)` should return `3`, but it will return `2` as per the current logic, which is incorrect.

2. The assertion for `func_1(5)` is supposed to check for the 5th NSW prime, which is not confirmed by the function logic, and the expected returned value is known to be `41`. The way the function accumulates values does not correspond to the correct NSW prime values.

Thus, since the function does not correctly compute and return the nth NSW prime number for all n, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
