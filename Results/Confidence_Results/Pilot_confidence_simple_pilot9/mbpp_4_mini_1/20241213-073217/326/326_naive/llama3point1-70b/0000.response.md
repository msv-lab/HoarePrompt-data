The given program aims to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here is the review of the code:

1. The program first sorts the input array `arr`.
2. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity to ensure that any actual difference can be lower.
3. The program then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between adjacent elements.
4. It updates `min_diff` if it finds a smaller difference.
5. Finally, it returns `min_diff`.

However, there are potential cases where the program will not handle correctly:

- If the input array has fewer than two elements (for instance, an empty array or an array with one element), the method will attempt to access index elements which do not exist, leading to an error. The program lacks a check for this scenario, which means it doesn't meet the problem requirements for all potential input cases.

For example:
- Input: `[]` (empty array) should lead to a defined behavior, but the current function would error out.
- Input: `[5]` (only one element) similarly should have defined behavior, but the current implementation doesn't handle it.

Therefore, since the program cannot handle arrays with fewer than two elements appropriately, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
