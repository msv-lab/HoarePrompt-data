To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we analyze the logic of the program and consider any potential edge cases.

The problem description states: "Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array."

Let's analyze the program provided:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

1. The function first checks if there are fewer than 2 elements in the array (i.e., `n < 2`). If this condition is met, it returns `0`. This is a logical choice since if there are fewer than two elements, it is not possible to compute a meaningful difference.

2. The function sorts the array. This is necessary because to determine the minimum difference, the elements should be compared in ascending order.

3. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity, which is also appropriate to ensure that any computed difference will be smaller than this initial value.

4. The function then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each consecutive pair of elements. If any calculated difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`.

5. Finally, it returns `min_diff`.

### Edge Cases

To verify the correctness, consider the following scenarios:

- **Case with negative numbers:** For an array containing negative numbers, such as `(-1, -3, -5)`, the minimum difference should still be computed correctly as `2` (the difference between `-3` and `-1`).

- **Case with duplicates:** For an array with duplicate values, such as `(5, 5, 5)`, the expected output should be `0` since the minimal difference between the elements is `0`.

- **Empty array or single element:** An empty array would lead the function to return `0`, which seems logical, but one might argue it's not clearly defined in the problem statement.

- **Case with only two numbers:** For the input `(8, 3)` with `n=2`, the expected output should be `5`.

Since no errors appear in various cases and edge scenarios, including negative numbers and duplicates, the function appears to fulfill the problem's requirement consistently.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies the minimum difference between any two elements in the array for every potential input case described in the problem statement.
