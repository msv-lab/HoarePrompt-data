Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function `func_1` that checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Logic of the Function**: 
   - The function iterates through the list using a for loop, comparing each element with the next. 
   - If any element is greater than the next one, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
   - If it successfully compares all adjacent elements without finding any out-of-order pairs, it returns `True`.

2. **Test Cases**: 
   - The provided assertions reflect various scenarios:
     - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True` because this list is sorted in ascending order.
     - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False` because `20` is followed by `17`, which is a valid unsorted case.
     - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` also returns `False` as `15` is followed by `14`, indicating another unsorted scenario.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function can handle lists with one element, empty lists, and lists containing duplicate values correctly, as they either trivially satisfy being sorted or do not violate the ordering rule.

Since the function meets the specified requirements for all potential cases based on the problem description, I have concluded that the program is correct.
