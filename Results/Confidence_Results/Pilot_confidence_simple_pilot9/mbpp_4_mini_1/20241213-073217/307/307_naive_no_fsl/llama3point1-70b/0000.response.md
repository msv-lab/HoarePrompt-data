To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem description and the code closely.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

### Code Analysis
The code defines a function `func_1(n)` which:
1. Initiates an index `idx` starting from 1.
2. Enters an infinite loop (`while True:`) where it calculates the triangular number using the formula \( T(idx) = \frac{idx \cdot (idx + 1)}{2} \).
3. Checks if the number of digits in the triangular number (using `len(str(triangular_num))`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. If the condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`.
5. If not, it increments the index and continues.

### Correctness Check
To verify if the program is correct, we need to consider:
- Triangular numbers grow quite rapidly, therefore this approach is feasible.
- The check for the number of digits is appropriate, as it uses the string conversion to assess the number of digits.

#### Edge Cases:
Let's consider a few cases:

1. **n = 1:** The smallest triangular number with 1 digit is 1 (the first triangular number). The function should return 1. (Correct)
2. **n = 2:** The smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (the fourth triangular number). The function should return 4. (Correct)
3. **n = 3:** The smallest triangular number with 3 digits is  105 (the fourteen triangular number). The function should return 14. (Correct)
4. **n = 100:** The function should calculate and return the correct index for the smallest triangular number that has 100 digits.

After considering some smaller and clear cases and the rapid growth of triangular numbers, we can validate that the code correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number for various inputs of `n`. 

The program does take into account the requirement of the number of digits and does not return until it finds a proper triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

### Conclusion
Having checked the growth of triangular numbers and the way the program calculates the required index, there are no corner cases or edge cases that disprove the correctness of the program as described.

Correctness: **True**
