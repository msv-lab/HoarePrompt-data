Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. It first converts the list into a set to remove duplicates, then checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it returns `None`, which is appropriate. If there are two or more unique numbers, it sorts the unique numbers and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number. 

The program handles edge cases effectively, such as when there are fewer than two unique elements.
