Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly finds the second smallest number in the list by first converting the list into a set (to remove duplicates) and then sorting it. The return statement returns the second element of the sorted unique numbers if there are at least two unique numbers; otherwise, it returns `None`. 

I have tested the code with the given assertions and they all pass as expected. For the case `[2, 2]`, there is only one unique number, so it correctly returns `None`. Similarly, for `[2, 2, 2]`, it also correctly returns `None`. 

All edge cases appear to be handled appropriately, and the program behaves as per the problem description for all provided examples. Therefore, there are no inputs that demonstrate the program does not work correctly; thus, the correctness holds true.
