To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the implementation carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the second smallest number in a list. 

### Program Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
```

1. **Extracting Unique Numbers:** The code starts by converting the list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, and then back to a list:
   ```python
   unique_nums = list(set(nums))
   ```

2. **Handling Length Check:** Next, it checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2:
   ```python
   if len(unique_nums) < 2:
       return None
   ```
   If there are fewer than 2 unique numbers, it returns `None`. This is correct since there can't be a second smallest number.

3. **Returning the Second Smallest:** Finally, it sorts the unique numbers and returns the second smallest:
   ```python
   return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
   ```

### Edge Cases:
1. **Input with No Elements:** 
   - If the input list is empty `[]`, the function should return `None`. It does, so this case is handled correctly.

2. **Input with One Element:** 
   - If the input list has one element `[5]`, the function should also return `None`. It does, so this case is handled correctly.

3. **Input with Two Identical Elements:** 
   - If the input list has two identical elements `[5, 5]`, the function should return `None` because there is no second distinct number. It processes this correctly.

4. **Input with Multiple Elements (including distinct values):**
   - For a list like `[3, 1, 2]`, it correctly identifies `2` as the second smallest after sorting.

5. **Input with Negative Numbers:** 
   - For input such as `[-1, -2, -3]`, it should correctly return `-2` as the second smallest.

Upon reviewing these cases, the program appears to handle all variations correctly.

### Conclusion:
I cannot find any potential edge case where the implementation fails to meet the problem description. Thus, the behavior of the function complies with the requirements of finding the second smallest number adequately.

Correctness: **True**
