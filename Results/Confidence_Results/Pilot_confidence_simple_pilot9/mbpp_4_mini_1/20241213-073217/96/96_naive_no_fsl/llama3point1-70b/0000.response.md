Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` accurately checks if all the elements in the given tuple have the same data type. It achieves this by creating a set of the types of each element in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one unique type, resulting in a length of 1. The code will return `True` in this case, confirming that all elements are of the same type.

Potential edge cases:
1. An empty tuple will return `True` since there are no elements to compare, and thus no different types can exist.
2. A tuple with a single element will also return `True`, as there is only one type present.
3. Different types in a tuple (e.g., `(1, 'string', 3.14)`) will yield `False`.

In all cases considered, the code behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I found no examples where the program does not meet the requirements.
