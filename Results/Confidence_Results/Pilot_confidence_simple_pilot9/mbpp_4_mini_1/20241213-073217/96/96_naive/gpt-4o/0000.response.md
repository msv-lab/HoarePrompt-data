Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all the elements in the tuple have the same data type. 

1. If the tuple is empty (`not tup`), it returns `True`, which is reasonable since there are no elements to contradict the assertion of being of the same type.
2. It retrieves the type of the first element and compares it to the type of each subsequent element.
3. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions (`assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))`, `assert func_1((1, 2, '4'))`, and `assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))`) cover cases of tuples with uniform and mixed data types. 

I cannot find a case where the function fails to operate according to the description, meaning it successfully meets the problem requirements for all potential cases. Thus, the implementation can be considered correct.
