Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) using the following formulas:
- The radial coordinate `r` is computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` (i.e., \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)).
- The angular coordinate `θ` is computed using the `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly determines the angle taking into account the signs of both `x` and `y`, thus giving the correct angle in all four quadrants.

The assertions provided in the code also indicate that the function is tested against specific values and returns the expected polar coordinates correctly for those cases. Since I cannot identify any specific case in which the function fails to produce the anticipated output conforming to the provided problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
