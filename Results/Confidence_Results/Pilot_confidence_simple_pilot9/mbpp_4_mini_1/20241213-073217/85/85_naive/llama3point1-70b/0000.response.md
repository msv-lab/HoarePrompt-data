Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by taking the maximum value and subtracting the minimum value. This approach will yield the correct result for all arrays with at least two elements.

However, one important case to consider is when the array contains fewer than two elements. If the array is empty or has only one element, the function will throw an error when attempting to find the maximum or minimum. 

That said, since no input is explicitly stated in the problem description, if we take the assumption that the array will meet the required conditions (at least two elements), the implementation holds.

Thus, under the assumption that input validation is not a part of the requirement and given any valid input array, the function will work correctly as expected to find the maximum difference.
