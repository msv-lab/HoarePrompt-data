Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(length, width)` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the provided `length` and `width`. This behaves as expected according to the problem description. 

1. For any positive values for `length` and `width`, the function will return a non-negative area.
2. If either `length` or `width` is zero, the area correctly computes to zero.
3. If both values are negative, the multiplication will yield a positive area, which doesn't align with the typical geometric interpretation of the area of a rectangle (area cannot be negative), but it is still mathematically correct in the context of multiplication.

However, since the problem does not specify constraints on the input values (e.g., they should be non-negative), the function correctly calculates the area based on the provided inputs regardless of whether they are appropriate in a real-world context. 

Therefore, there are no cases where the function fails to compute the area as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
