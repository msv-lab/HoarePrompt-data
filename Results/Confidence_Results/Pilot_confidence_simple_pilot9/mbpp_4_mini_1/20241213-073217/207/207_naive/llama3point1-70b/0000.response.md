Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(length, width)` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` by the `width`. Given that area is defined as the product of length and width, the implementation satisfies the problem description for all potential inputs, including edge cases such as zero or negative values. 

All possible scenarios work correctly:
- For positive values, it returns the correct area.
- For a length or width of zero, it correctly returns zero as the area.
- For negative values, while a rectangle with negative dimensions is not physically meaningful, the function still returns the product (which could be viewed as an implementation quirk).

As no counterexamples show the code failing to meet the described requirements, it is correct.
