To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its expected behavior.

The problem description states that we need to split a list into two parts based on an integer L, where the first part has a length of L, and the result should be returned as a tuple.

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements this by:
1. Taking a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input.
2. Returning a tuple consisting of two lists: 
   - The first list with the first L elements of `lst` (`lst[:L]`).
   - The second list containing the remainder of the elements (`lst[L:]`).

Now, let's review the test cases in the assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)` returns `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`, which is correct.
2. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2)` returns `(['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])`, which is correct.
3. `func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4)` returns `(['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])`, which is correct.

Next, we should consider edge cases and potential failures:

- What if `L` is 0? The output should be `([], lst)` which is handled correctly.
- What if `L` is greater than the length of the list? For instance, `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` should return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is also handled correctly.
- What if the list is empty? In this case, `func_1([], 0)` should return `([], [])`, which is correct.

Since the program handles all mentioned edge cases correctly, it meets the requirement of the problem description for all possible inputs.

Hence, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **True** 

The implementation correctly splits the list according to the provided integer `L`, handles various edge cases, and returns the expected output.
