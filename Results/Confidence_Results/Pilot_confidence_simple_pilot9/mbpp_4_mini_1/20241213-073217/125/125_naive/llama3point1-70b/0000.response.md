To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function:

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

**Analysis:**
The program is attempting to split the list `lst` into multiple lists by taking every nth element starting from each index from 0 to n-1.

1. When `n` is greater than the length of the list, the program will not generate valid sublists for some or all indices, leading to empty sublists.
2. When `n` is 0, this will cause an error since trying to slice with a step of 0 is not allowed in Python, resulting in a `ValueError`.
3. With `n` equal to 1, it will return a single list containing all elements of `lst`, which is correct as per the problem.
4. For a negative value of `n`, it will effectively result in empty lists since negative strides are invalid in this context.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1:** For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the expected output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`. The program correctly returns that output.
- **Case 2:** For `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 0`, this should raise an error since slicing with a step of 0 is invalid.
- **Case 3:** For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 5`, the expected output should be `[[], [], [], [], []]` since `n` exceeds the length of the list. The program would return this correctly, however, logically it does not address how this should be handled based on the problem description.

Given this analysis, the program fails in the following ways:
- It does not handle the case when `n` is 0, which should not be permissible.
- It doesn't specify how it should behave when the input list is shorter than `n`.

Thus, since the program does not work correctly for all cases based on the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
