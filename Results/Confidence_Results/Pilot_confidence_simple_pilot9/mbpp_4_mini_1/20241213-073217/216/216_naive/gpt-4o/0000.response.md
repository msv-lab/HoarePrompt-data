Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle negative numbers or zero. For example, if the input list is `[-1, 0, 1]`, the sorted list would be `[-1, 0, 1]`, and the function would incorrectly return `False`, even though these numbers are consequently listed. Additionally, input lists containing negative sequences, like `[-3, -2, -1]`, should return `True`, but the current implementation does not account for negativity and would also return `False`. 

Thus, the program fails to recognize lists of consecutive negative numbers, which is a potential case that the problem description does not cover.
