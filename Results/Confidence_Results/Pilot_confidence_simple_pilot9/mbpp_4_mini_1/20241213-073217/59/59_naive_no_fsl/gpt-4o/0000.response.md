Correctness: **True**

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into one list using the `+` operator, and then sorts this combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function. The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works for various test cases, including handling duplicates and mixed orderings within the input lists.

Given the logic of how list concatenation and sorting work in Python, and seeing no potential edge cases or issues in the provided examples, it's reasonable to conclude that the function meets the problem's requirements comprehensively.

Thus, since all potential cases I considered operate correctly according to the problem description, the program is correct.
