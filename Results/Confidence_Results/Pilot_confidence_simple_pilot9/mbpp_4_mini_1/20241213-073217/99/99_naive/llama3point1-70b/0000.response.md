Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. The logic used in the function iterates through the string using a step of 2, which effectively selects characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). 

For any input string, this approach will accurately return a string consisting of characters from even indices only. For example:
- If the input is `"abcdef"`, the output would be `"ace"`, which correctly omits characters at indices 1, 3, and 5.
- For an empty string `""`, it correctly returns `""`.
- For a string with one character `"a"`, it returns `"a"`.

Since the function meets all requirements of the problem description for every potential input, the correctness is validated as true.
