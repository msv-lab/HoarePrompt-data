Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(num1, num2)` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only by using the XOR operation (`^`) between the two numbers. The result of `num1 ^ num2` will have a bit set to 1 at positions where the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ. The `bin()` function converts this result into a binary string, and `count('1')` counts the number of set bits (differing bits). 

If the count of differing bits is exactly 1, it returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic accurately meets the problem description, and I cannot think of a case where it would fail to satisfy the requirement of determining whether two numbers differ at one bit position only. Examples such as `(4, 5)` (binary `100` and `101`, differ at one bit) will return `True`, while `(4, 6)` (binary `100` and `110`, differ at two bits) will return `False`. 

As all potential cases I can think of are handled correctly, the program is deemed correct.
