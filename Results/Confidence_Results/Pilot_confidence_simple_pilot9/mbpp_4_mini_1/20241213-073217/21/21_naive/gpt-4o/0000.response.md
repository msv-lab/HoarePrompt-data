Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1(lst)` is defined to find the smallest number in a list using Python's built-in `min` function; however, the problem description lacks clarity regarding whether the input list can be empty. The program does not handle the case of an empty list, which would raise a `ValueError`. For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the program would fail. Therefore, since the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, it is deemed incorrect.
