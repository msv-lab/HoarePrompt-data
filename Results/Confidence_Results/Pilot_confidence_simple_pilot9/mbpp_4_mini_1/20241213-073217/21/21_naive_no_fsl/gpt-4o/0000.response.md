Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements a function `func_1(lst)` that returns the smallest number in a list. It uses the built-in `min()` function which handles various cases appropriately.

Here are some test cases considered:

1. `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` correctly returns `1`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` correctly returns `1`.
3. `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` correctly returns `45`.

Additionally, the following edge cases do not cause failures:

- It can handle negative numbers, for example, `func_1([-1, -100, 0])` would return `-100`.
- It works with a single element list like `func_1([5])`, which would return `5`.
- It can handle an empty list, though in practice the `min()` function would raise a `ValueError`. If the program was intended to handle empty lists gracefully, it would need to be modified for that case.

Considering the general behavior on the input lists and provided examples, the function behaves correctly in the tested scenarios. Since I cannot find any failure case that contradicts the problem description, the program is considered correct.
