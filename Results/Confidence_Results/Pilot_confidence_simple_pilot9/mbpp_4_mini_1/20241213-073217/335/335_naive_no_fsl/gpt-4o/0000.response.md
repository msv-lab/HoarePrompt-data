Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly handles the case where the substring occurs multiple times within the main string. According to the problem description, it should return the first occurrence and its positions. However, the program doesn't account for scenarios where multiple occurrences exist and only considers the first match. 

For example, suppose we input the string `'python python programming'` with the substring `'python'`. The current implementation would only return the position of the first occurrence (`(0, 6)`), but the problem description does not mention any specific handling or constraints on multiple occurrences (and doesn't explicitly clarify that it must only return the first). 

Thus, if we were to test a case like:
``` 
assert func_1('python python programming', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6) 
```
This works according to the current implementation. However, if we test:
```
func_1('python python programming', 'python') 
```
There are indeed two occurrences (indices 0-6 and 7-13), but the function only returns the first, leading to ambiguity in the problem description's handling of multiple matches.

This oversight presents a situation where the description is not fully addressed and may lead to confusion depending on how substring occurrences are interpreted, hence resulting in correctness **False**.
