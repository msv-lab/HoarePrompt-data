Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the substring in the string. According to the problem description, it should find all occurrences and their positions, but the provided implementation only finds the first occurrence. For example:

```python
string = "ababcabc"
substring = "abc"
```

In this case, "abc" occurs multiple times, but the function will only return the position of the first occurrence (which is at index 2). The expected output should ideally include all occurrences and their respective positions, but the given implementation fails to do so. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
