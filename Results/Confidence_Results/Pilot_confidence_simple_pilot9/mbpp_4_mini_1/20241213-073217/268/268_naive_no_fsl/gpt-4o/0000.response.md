To determine the correctness of the provided program `func_1`, I'll analyze the implementation based on the problem description, which states the function should return the maximum of the n-th column in a given matrix represented as a list of lists.

The implementation of `func_1` is as follows:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
```

Now, let's consider a few potential edge cases:

1. **Out of index bounds**: If `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in `matrix`, this will raise an `IndexError`.
   - Example: `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 3)` will fail because there is no 4th column (index 3).

2. **Empty Matrix**: If the input matrix is an empty list, trying to access any column will also raise an `IndexError`.
   - Example: `func_1([], 0)` will fail due to the empty matrix.

3. **Non-integer Column Index**: If `n` is provided as a non-integer type (e.g., a string), it will raise a `TypeError`.
   - Example: `func_1([[1, 2, 3]], "1")` will fail because you cannot use a string as an index.

Given the analysis, the implementation does not handle these edge cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle situations where the requested column `n` is out of bounds, the matrix is empty, or `n` is not an integer.
