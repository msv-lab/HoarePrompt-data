To determine the correctness of the provided program against the specified problem description, let's analyze the code and its functionality.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) and returns the maximum value from the n-th column of that matrix.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Indexing**: The program uses `row[n - 1]` to access the n-th column. This works under the assumption that `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 1, it accesses the first column, which aligns with typical column indexing in programming languages.

2. **Column Existence**: The program does not check if the n-th column exists in each row. If `n` is greater than the number of columns in any of the rows, it will raise an `IndexError`. For example:
   - Input: `matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], n = 3`
   - This will cause an error because there is no third column.

3. **Empty Matrix**: The function does not handle the case where the matrix is empty. If `matrix` is empty, calling `max()` on an empty iterable will also raise a `ValueError`.

4. **Negative Values for n**: If `n` is negative, `row[n - 1]` will access invalid indices, which could also lead to an error.

Given these considerations, we can establish potential edge cases where the program will fail:

- If `n` is out of bounds (greater than the number of columns or less than 1).
- If the matrix is empty.
- If `n` is negative.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle edge cases properly and will fail under certain conditions. Thus, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly for cases such as an empty matrix or when `n` is beyond the number of columns in the matrix.
