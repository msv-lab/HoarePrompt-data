Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the implementation uses `set(lst)` which converts the list into a set, effectively removing all repeated elements and resulting in the sum of all unique elements, rather than the sum of non-repeated elements. 

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements are `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and their sum should be `20`, but the code will sum all unique elements, yielding `21` (`1+2+3+4+5+6`). 

This discrepancy means that the function does not fulfill the requirement as stated in the problem description.
