To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to take in two tuples and return a tuple containing the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses `zip()` to pair the elements of the two tuples. This effectively means it will iterate over the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` simultaneously.
2. It uses a generator expression to subtract each element in `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1`.
3. The result is converted back to a tuple before being returned.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Tuples of Different Lengths**: If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, `zip()` will stop creating pairs when the shortest tuple is exhausted. This means that elements in the longer tuple that do not have corresponding pairs won't be included in the result. This behavior may not adhere to a strict interpretation of "subtract elements by index," which implies that both tuples should be of equal length.
- **Empty Tuples**: If both tuples are empty, the result will also be an empty tuple, which is correct. However, if one is empty and the other is not, it won't match an expected behavior of element-wise subtraction.

### Testing the problem:
- Example 1: `func_1((3, 5), (1, 2))` should return `(2, 3)` and it does.
- Example 2: `func_1((3, 5), (1,))` would return `(2,)`, while the intended behavior may be to indicate an error since the lengths do not match.
- Example 3: `func_1((), ())` correctly returns `()`.
- Example 4: `func_1((2,), (1, 3))` would return `(1,)`, again ignoring the unmatched value.

### Conclusion:
The implementation does not handle the scenario where tuples are of unequal lengths explicitly by raising an error or providing a meaningful result. By simply ignoring the excess elements does not adhere strictly to a conceptual expectation of element-wise operation when the sizes differ.

Thus, given the identified issue:

Correctness: **False** 

This is because the program does not correctly handle tuples of different lengths, which violates the requirement as inferred from the problem description.
