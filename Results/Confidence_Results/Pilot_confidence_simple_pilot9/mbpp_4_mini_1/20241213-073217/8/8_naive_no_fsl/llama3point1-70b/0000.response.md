To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its behavior against the problem description, which states that it should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Finding Occurrences:**
   - `first_occurrence` correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of `char`.
   - `last_occurrence` correctly identifies the index of the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Conditional Logic:**
   - If both occurrences are found, the code checks if they are the same. 
     - If they are the same, it replaces only one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
     - If they are different, it constructs a new string excluding both the first and last occurrences.

3. **Returns the Original String:**
   - If `char` is not found in the string, it simply returns the original string.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case with No Occurrences:**
   - Input: `func_1("hello", "x")` should return "hello" as "x" is not found.

2. **Case with Only One Occurrence:**
   - Input: `func_1("hello", "h")` should return "ello" since "h" is both the first and last occurrence.

3. **Case with Multiple Occurrences:**
   - Input: `func_1("hello world hello", "h")` should return "ello world ello" since both "h"s need to be removed.

4. **Same Character as First and Last:**
   - Input: `func_1("aaaaa", "a")` should return "aaa" because both the first and last "a" are removed.

5. **All Occurrences Should Be Different:**
   - Input: `func_1("abcabc", "a")` should return "bcab" with both "a"s being removed.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the above scenarios, the program works correctly for all tested cases. The logic implemented sufficiently handles the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The provided function correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string and handles potential edge cases as expected per the problem description.
