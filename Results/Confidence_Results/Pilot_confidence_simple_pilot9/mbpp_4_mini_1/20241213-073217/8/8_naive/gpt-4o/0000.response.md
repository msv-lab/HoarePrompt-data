To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string, and to consider edge cases that might not be accounted for.

Here’s a breakdown of the function:

1. **Finding Indices**:
   - The program uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(ch)` for the last occurrence of the character.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If either index is -1 (meaning the character does not exist in the string), or if the first and last indices are the same (meaning the character appears only once), the function returns the original string.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - When both occurrences are valid and different, it constructs the new string by slicing and concatenating segments of `s`.

**Potential Issues**:
- If the input string is empty (i.e., `s = ""`), this will call `find()` and `rfind()` which will both return -1, causing the function to return the empty string. This seems reasonable but is worth noting.
- If the character `ch` does not appear in the string, the function again returns the original string which is expected.
- If the character only appears once (as stated), it returns the original string as well, which matches the requirement.
- The slicing logic seems correct for removing the character based on the found indices.

**Test Cases**:
- Checking a case with no occurrences:
  - Input: `func_1('hello', 'x')` – Expected Output: `'hello'`. The program appropriately handles this.
  
- Checking a case with multiple occurrences:
  - Input: `func_1('racecar', 'r')` – Expected Output: `'aceca'`. The program would return `'aceca'`, which is correct.

Based on the above analysis, the function appears to satisfy the problem statement under all checked scenarios.

However, upon deeper inspection, there still seems to be a condition that it does not handle correctly:
- If the input string has no occurrences of `ch`, such as `func_1('hello', 'x')`, the requirement does not specify that the original string should be returned without changes since the expectation is to remove both occurrences. The program returns the original string in such cases.

This leads to observing that there exists at least one case (i.e., when the character is absent) where the output does not align with the described functionality of "removing first and last occurrences".

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
