The provided function `func_1` does not seem to be directly related to the problem of calculating the number of ways to paint bricks based on the given conditions. Instead, it seems to be a utility function for managing input/output buffering. Therefore, we will focus on extracting the precondition based on the variables in the main problem description rather than this function.

Here is the extracted precondition:

**Precondition: **n** is an integer representing the number of bricks, **m** is an integer representing the number of different colors available, and **k** is an integer representing the number of bricks with a color different from the color of the brick to the left (with the first brick not counted). All values satisfy 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.
