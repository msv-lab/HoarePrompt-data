Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout` and 'sep' set to `b' '`, `at_start` is `False`, the strings `str(n)` and `str(k)` have been written to `sys.stdout` separated by a space `b' '`, and `b'\n'` has been written to `sys.stdout`. After executing the if statement, `kwargs` no longer contains the key 'flush'.***
