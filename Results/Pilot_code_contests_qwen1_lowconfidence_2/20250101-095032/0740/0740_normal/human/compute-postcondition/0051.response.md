Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), `x` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `counter` is initialized appropriately based on the elements in `x`, `res` is incremented by 1 if either (1) `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]` when `counter[i][1] != -1`, or (2) `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]` when `counter[i][1] == -1`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `res` is incremented by 1 in both cases.***
