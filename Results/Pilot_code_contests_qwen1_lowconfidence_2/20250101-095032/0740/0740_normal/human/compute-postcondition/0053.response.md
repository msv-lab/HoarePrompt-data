The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially incremented by 1 in the precondition, it is already incremented once. Now, it is incremented again by 1. Therefore, `res` is now incremented by 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is incremented by 2**
