Postcondition: ***`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least two elements, and `i` is an index within the bounds of the outer list of `counter`. The variable `res` is increased by 1. Specifically, if `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1, then `res` is incremented by 1 based on whether `counter[i][0]` is -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`, or `counter[i + 1][0]`. No other changes occur in the list `counter` or the variable `res` under other conditions.***
