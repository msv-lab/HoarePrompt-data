The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. In the initial state, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, and `sep` is set to `b' '`. No variables are updated by this code, only an action is performed.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout`, 'sep' set to `b' '`, `at_start` is `False`, and `x` is `n`. A space character (encoded in bytes) is written to `sys.stdout`.**
