Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\).
   - `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout`, 'sep' set to `b' '`, and `x` is `n`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - Initially, `x` is set to `n`.

4. **Analyzing the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `n`.
   - Since the loop iterates over `args`, it will now move to the next element in `args`, which is `k`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `x` will be updated to the next element in `args`, which is `k`.
   - `at_start` remains `False` as the loop has already started and will continue to the next element.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `args` remains the same: a tuple containing `n` and `k`.
   - `kwargs` remains the same: a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout`, 'sep' set to `b' '`.
   - `x` is now `k`.
   - `at_start` remains `False`.

**State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout`, 'sep' set to `b' '`, `x` is `k`, `at_start` is `False`**.
