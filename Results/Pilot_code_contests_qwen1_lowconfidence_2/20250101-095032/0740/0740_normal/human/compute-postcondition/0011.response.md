Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout` and 'sep' set to `b' '`, `x` is `k`, `at_start` is `False`. Since the `if` condition `not at_start` is true (given in the precondition), the `if` part applies and no changes are made to the variables as they are already in the specified state. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
