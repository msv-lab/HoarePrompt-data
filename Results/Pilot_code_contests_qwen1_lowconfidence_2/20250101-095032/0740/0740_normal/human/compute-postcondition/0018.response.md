The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The previous value of `at_start` was also `False`, so this assignment does not change its value. The values of `x` and the string `str(n)` being written to the file are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `x` is `n`, and the string `str(n)` is written to the file.**
