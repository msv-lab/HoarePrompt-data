Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`.
   - `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout` and 'sep' set to `b' '`.
   - `x` is currently `k`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - The string `str(k)` has been written to `sys.stdout`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `args`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `k`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `x`:**
   - Since `x` is iterating through the elements of `args`, and the previous value of `x` was `k`, the next value of `x` will be the first element of `args` (which is `n`).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `x` will be updated to the first element of `args`, which is `n`.
   - The variable `at_start` remains `False` as it does not change within the loop.
   - No changes are needed for `args` or `kwargs` as they remain the same.

5. **Final State:**
   - `x` will be `n`.
   - `at_start` remains `False`.
   - The string `str(n)` will not have been written to `sys.stdout` yet because the loop has not executed fully yet.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout` and 'sep' set to `b' '`, `x` is `n`, `at_start` is `False`**.
