Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `x` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `counter` is the same as before, `res` is the original value of `res` plus 1, and `i` is `i_curr + 1`. This holds true whether `counter[i][0]` is `-1` or not since there is no else part provided and the postcondition for the if part does not depend on the value of `counter[i][0]`.***
