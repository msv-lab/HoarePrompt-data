Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\).
   - `x` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`.
   - `counter` is initialized appropriately based on the elements in `x`.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if either (1) `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]` when `counter[i][1] != -1`, or (2) `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]` when `counter[i][1] == -1`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 in both cases.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

3. **Current State Before Loop Execution:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 in both cases.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, `i` should become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - `res` should still be incremented by 1 in both cases as per the condition.

6. **Final States:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 in both cases.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and `res` is incremented by 1 in both cases**.
