Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout`, 'sep' set to `b' '``, and `x` is `n`. If `at_start` is `True`, the overall state remains unchanged. If `at_start` is `False`, a space character (encoded in bytes) is written to `sys.stdout`***.
