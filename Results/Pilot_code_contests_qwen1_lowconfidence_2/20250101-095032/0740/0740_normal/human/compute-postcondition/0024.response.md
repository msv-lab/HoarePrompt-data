The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `args`, which is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^5, and `kwargs`, which is a dictionary with the following possible keys: 'sep' (default value is b' '), 'file' (default value is sys.stdout), 'end' (default value is b'\n'), and 'flush' (default value is False). 

Based on the provided information, there are no specific return values mentioned, implying the function may perform some operation but does not explicitly return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `args` containing two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^5, and a dictionary `kwargs` with default values for 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'.**
