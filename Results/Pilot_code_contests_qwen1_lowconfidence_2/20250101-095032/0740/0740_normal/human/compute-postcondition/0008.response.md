The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This does not affect the values of `args`, `kwargs`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `at_start` and keeps the unchanged values of `args`, `kwargs`, and `x`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout`, 'sep' set to `b' '`, and `x` is `n`, `at_start` is `False`**
