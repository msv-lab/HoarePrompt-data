`res` is incremented by 1 because of the line `res += 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), `x` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `counter` is initialized appropriately based on the elements in `x`, `res` is the count of unique elements in `x` plus 1, `i` is 1, the current value of `counter[i][0]` is not -1, the current value of `counter[i][1]` is not -1, and `(counter[i + 1][0] == -1 or counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1])`**
