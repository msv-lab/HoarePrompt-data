Postcondition: ***`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least two elements, and `i` is `k + 1`. `res` is incremented by 1 if either `counter[k][0]` equals -1, `counter[k][0]` is greater than `counter[k + 1][0]`, or `counter[k][0]` is greater than `counter[k + 1][1]`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
