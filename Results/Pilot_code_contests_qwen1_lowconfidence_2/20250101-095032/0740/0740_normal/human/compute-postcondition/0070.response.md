Postcondition: ***`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains at least two elements, and `i` is an index such that `counter[i + 1][0]` is equal to -1. If `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, then `res` is increased by 1. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the list `counter` or the variable `res` under other conditions.***
