The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was incremented from its previous value, the updated value of `res` is one more than its previous value. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), `x` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `counter` is initialized appropriately based on the elements in `x`, `res` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0.**
