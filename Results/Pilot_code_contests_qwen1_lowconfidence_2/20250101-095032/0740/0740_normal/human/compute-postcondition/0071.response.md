Postcondition: ***`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains at least two elements, and `i` is an index such that `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1. After the execution of the if-else block, `res` is increased by 1 if `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]` (if the if condition is true), or `counter[i + 1][0]` (if the else condition is true). In both cases, `counter[i + 1][0]` and `counter[i + 1][1]` remain not equal to -1, and no other changes occur in the list `counter` or the variable `res` under other conditions.***
