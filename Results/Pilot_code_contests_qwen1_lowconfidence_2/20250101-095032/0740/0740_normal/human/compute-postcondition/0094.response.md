Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `x`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), and `x` is a list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq n\) for each \(i\) from 1 to `k`. After executing the function, the program state will be such that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `counter` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the first and last occurrence index of each element in `x`. The function then calculates and returns the count (`res`) of unique elements in `x` based on specific conditions involving the indices stored in `counter`. The final value of `res` reflects the number of times certain conditions are satisfied throughout the iterations of the loops.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `x` contains only one unique element, `res` will be 1 since there will be no elements that satisfy the conditions in the second and third loops.
- If `x` contains consecutive unique elements, `res` will increment for each pair of consecutive elements that do not have any other elements between them or are the last element in `x`.

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not explicitly handle the case where `counter` might contain tuples with `-1` values for both elements, which could occur if an element in `x` does not appear again in the list. This should be considered as a valid edge case.
