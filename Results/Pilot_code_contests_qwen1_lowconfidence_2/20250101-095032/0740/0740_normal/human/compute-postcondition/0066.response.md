Postcondition: **`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains at least two elements, and `i` is an index such that `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1. After the execution of the if-else block, `res` is increased by 1 if `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`. If `counter[i][0]` does not meet this condition, the postcondition remains unchanged. Additionally, `counter[i + 1][0]` and `counter[i + 1][1]` remain not equal to -1.**
