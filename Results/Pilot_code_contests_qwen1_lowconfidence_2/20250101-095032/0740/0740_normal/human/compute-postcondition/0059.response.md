Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `res` is incremented by 2. If `counter[i][0]` is not -1, and either `counter[i + 1][0]` is -1 or greater than `counter[i][1]`, `res` is incremented by 2 again. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `counter[i][0]` is -1, `res` is 2.***
