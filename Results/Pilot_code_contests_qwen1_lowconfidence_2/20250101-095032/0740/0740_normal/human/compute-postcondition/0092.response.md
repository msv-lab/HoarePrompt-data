The function `func_2(res)` is called, which means `res` is incremented by 1 for every iteration where the specified conditions within `func_2` are met. However, the exact behavior of `func_2` is not defined in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change we know for certain is that `res` is incremented.

Given the initial state where `counter` is a list of lists, each inner list has at least two elements, and `i` is `n`, and `res` is incremented by 1, the output state is:

Output State: **`counter` is a list of lists, each inner list has at least two elements; `i` is `n`; `res` is incremented by 1.**
