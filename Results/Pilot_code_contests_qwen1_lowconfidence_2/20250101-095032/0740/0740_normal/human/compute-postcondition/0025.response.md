Functionality: **This function accepts a tuple `args` containing two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), and a dictionary `kwargs` with optional keys for `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints the values of `n` and `k` to the specified output stream (`file`), separated by a space (`sep`), followed by a newline (`end`). If `flush` is set to `True` in `kwargs`, it flushes the output stream. The function ensures that only valid `kwargs` keys are considered, and any remaining keys in `kwargs` are ignored after processing.**

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `args` always contains exactly two integers. If `args` contains fewer than two integers or more than two integers, the function will raise an error.
- The function does not check if `file` is a valid file-like object. If `file` is not a valid file-like object, the function may raise an error.
- The function does not handle the case where `sep` is not a string. Although `str(x)` is used to convert `x` to a string, `sep` is directly written to the file without conversion. If `sep` is not a string, it may cause a TypeError.
- The function does not handle the case where `end` is not a byte string. Since `file.write` is called with `end`, it should be a byte string, but the function does not enforce this.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid `kwargs` keys other than ignoring them. This could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid keys are passed.
