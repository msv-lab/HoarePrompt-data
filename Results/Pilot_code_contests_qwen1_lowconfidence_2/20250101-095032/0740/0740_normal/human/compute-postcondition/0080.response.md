Postcondition: ***`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least two elements, and `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is within the bounds of the outer list of `counter`. If `counter[i][0]` equals -1 or if `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`, then `i` is updated to `i + 1` and `res` is incremented by 1. If `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `i` and `res`.***
