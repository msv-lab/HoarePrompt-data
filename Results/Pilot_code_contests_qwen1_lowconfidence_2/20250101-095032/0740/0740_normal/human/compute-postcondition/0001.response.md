The code pops the 'sep' key from the kwargs dictionary with a default value of `b' '` and assigns it to the variable `sep`. Similarly, it pops the 'file' key from the kwargs dictionary with a default value of `sys.stdout` and assigns it to the variable `file`. The values of `args` and the remaining keys in `kwargs` are not affected.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5, `kwargs` is a dictionary with the key 'file' popped and set to `sys.stdout`, the key 'sep' popped and set to `b' '`, and the keys 'end' and 'flush' remain unchanged with their default values `b'\n'` and `False` respectively.**
