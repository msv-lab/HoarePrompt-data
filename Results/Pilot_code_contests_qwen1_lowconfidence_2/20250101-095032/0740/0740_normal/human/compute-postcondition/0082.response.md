Postcondition: ***`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least two elements, and `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is within the bounds of the outer list of `counter`. After the execution of the if-else block, `res` is incremented by 1 if either `counter[i][0]` equals -1, `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`. If none of these conditions are met, `res` remains unchanged.***
