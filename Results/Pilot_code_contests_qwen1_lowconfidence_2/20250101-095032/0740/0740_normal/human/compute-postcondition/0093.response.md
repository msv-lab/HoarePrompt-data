The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x`. 

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^5.
- `x` is a list of k positive integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ n for each i from 1 to k.

Based on the given constraints, the function does not have any specific return conditions mentioned directly in the prompt. However, we know that the function will process the parameters according to their constraints. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `x`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers within specified ranges, and `x` is a list of positive integers also within specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `x`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^5, and `x` is a list of k positive integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ n for each i from 1 to k.**
