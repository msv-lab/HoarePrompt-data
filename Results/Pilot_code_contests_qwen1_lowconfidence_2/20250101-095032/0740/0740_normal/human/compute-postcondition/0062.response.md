Postcondition: ***`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains at least two elements, and `i` is an index such that `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1.***

This postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the condition from the if statement, specifying that `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1 after entering the if condition.
