`res` is incremented by 1. Initially, `res` is incremented by 1 in both cases, so it is already incremented once before this line of code. After executing `res += 1`, `res` will be incremented by 1 again. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is incremented by 2**
