`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `counter[i + 1][0]` remains unchanged and is not equal to -1. The other variables and their conditions are also unaffected.

Output State: **`counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1, `counter` is a list of lists where each inner list has at least two elements, and `i` is an index within the bounds of the outer list of `counter`; `res` is incremented by 1**
