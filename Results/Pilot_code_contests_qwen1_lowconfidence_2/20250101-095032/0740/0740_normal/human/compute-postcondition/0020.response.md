The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` impacts the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the key `'end'` and writing its corresponding value to `file`. The initial state has `kwargs` with `'file'` set to `sys.stdout` and `'sep'` set to `b' '`. The value of `'end'` is set to `b'\n'` (the default end value for `write`).

After executing the code, the `kwargs` dictionary no longer contains the key `'end'`, and the value `b'\n'` is written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout` and 'sep' set to `b' '`, `at_start` is `False`, the strings `str(n)` and `str(k)` have been written to `sys.stdout` separated by a space `b' '`, and `b'\n'` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
