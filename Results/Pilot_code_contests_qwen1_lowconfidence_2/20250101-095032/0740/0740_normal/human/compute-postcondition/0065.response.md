`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `counter[i + 1][0]` is not affected and is not equal to -1, and the value of `counter[i + 1][1]` is not affected and is not equal to -1. The value of `counter[i][0]` remains either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1, `counter[i + 1][1]` is not equal to -1, `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`**
