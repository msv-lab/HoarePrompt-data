The variable `at_start` is reassigned to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout` and 'sep' set to `b' '`, `x` is `k`, `at_start` is `False`, and the string `str(k)` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
