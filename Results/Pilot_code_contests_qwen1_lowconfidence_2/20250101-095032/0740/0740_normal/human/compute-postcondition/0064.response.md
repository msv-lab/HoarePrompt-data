Postcondition: **`counter` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains at least two elements, `i` is an index such that `counter[i + 1][0]` is not equal to -1 and currently, the value of `counter[i + 1][1]` is not equal to -1. Additionally, either `counter[i][0]` is equal to -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`.**
