The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `sep`. Since no other operations are performed on `sep` or any other variables in the given code snippet, the only change is that `sep` is written to the file. 

The output state is:
Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `x` is `n`, `sep` is written to the file**
