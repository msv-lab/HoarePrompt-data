The given code is a docstring and does not perform any operations that would change the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5, and kwargs is a dictionary with the following possible keys: 'sep' (default value is b' '), 'file' (default value is sys.stdout), 'end' (default value is b'\n'), and 'flush' (default value is False).**
