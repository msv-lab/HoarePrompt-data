The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. According to the initial state, `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'sep' set to `b' '`, so `sep` is `b' '`. This write operation does not change the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `x`, or `at_start`. 

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`, `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'file' set to `sys.stdout`, 'sep' set to `b' '`, `x` is `k`, `at_start` is `False`**
