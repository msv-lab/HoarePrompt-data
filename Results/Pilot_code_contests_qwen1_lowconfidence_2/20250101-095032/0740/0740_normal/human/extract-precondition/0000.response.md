Precondition: **args is a tuple containing two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5, and kwargs is a dictionary with the following possible keys: 'sep' (default value is b' '), 'file' (default value is sys.stdout), 'end' (default value is b'\n'), and 'flush' (default value is False).** 

However, based on the problem description and the context, this function does not seem to be part of the solution for counting the number of valid scenarios for Alice. It appears to be a separate function that simply prints values to a stream, which is not related to the logic required to solve the given problem.
