The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `x`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), and `x` is a list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq n\) for each \(i\) from 1 to `k`. After executing the function, the program state will be such that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `counter` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the first and last occurrence index of each element in `x`. The function then calculates and returns the count (`res`) of unique elements in `x` based on specific conditions involving the indices stored in `counter`. The final value of `res` reflects the number of times certain conditions are satisfied throughout the iterations of the loops.
