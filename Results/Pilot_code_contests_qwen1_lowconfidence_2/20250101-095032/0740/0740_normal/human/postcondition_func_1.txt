This function accepts a tuple `args` containing two integers `n` and `k`, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), and a dictionary `kwargs` with optional keys for `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints the values of `n` and `k` to the specified output stream (`file`), separated by a space (`sep`), followed by a newline (`end`). If `flush` is set to `True` in `kwargs`, it flushes the output stream. The function ensures that only valid `kwargs` keys are considered, and any remaining keys in `kwargs` are ignored after processing.
