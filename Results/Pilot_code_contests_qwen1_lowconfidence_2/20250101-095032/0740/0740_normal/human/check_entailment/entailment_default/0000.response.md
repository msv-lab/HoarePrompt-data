Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Scenarios**: The code attempts to count valid starting and ending positions for Alice's token, but it does not correctly account for all possible movements and scenarios. Specifically, the logic for determining valid pairs `(i, j)` is flawed and does not consider all valid moves Alice can make.

2. **Misinterpretation of Conditions**: The conditions for counting valid scenarios are not correctly interpreted. For instance, the code does not properly handle the cases where Alice can move her token to an adjacent cell between questions, which is crucial for ensuring she can consistently answer "NO".

3. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The function `func_2` is used to print the result, but the actual logic to compute the result is flawed. The variables `n` and `k` are not used effectively, and the calculation of `res` does not accurately reflect the number of valid scenarios.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
