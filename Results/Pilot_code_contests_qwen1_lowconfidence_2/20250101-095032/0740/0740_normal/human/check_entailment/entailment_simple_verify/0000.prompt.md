You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with n cells. There are n cells labeled from 1 through n. For each i from 1 to n-1, cells i and i+1 are adjacent.

Alice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is. 

Bob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers x_1, x_2, …, x_k in order. In the i-th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell x_i. That is, Alice can answer either "YES" or "NO" to each Bob's question.

At most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.

You are given n and Bob's questions x_1, …, x_k. You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. 

Let (a,b) denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell a and ends at cell b. Two scenarios (a_i, b_i) and (a_j, b_j) are different if a_i ≠ a_j or b_i ≠ b_j.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5) — the number of cells and the number of questions Bob asked.

The second line contains k integers x_1, x_2, …, x_k (1 ≤ x_i ≤ n) — Bob's questions.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Examples

4 8
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1


Output


0


Input


100000 1
42


Output


299997

Note

The notation (i,j) denotes a scenario where Alice starts at cell i and ends at cell j.

In the first example, the valid scenarios are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5). For example, (3,4) is valid since Alice can start at cell 3, stay there for the first three questions, then move to cell 4 after the last question. 

(4,5) is valid since Alice can start at cell 4, stay there for the first question, the move to cell 5 for the next two questions. Note that (4,5) is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.

In the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.

In the last example, all (i,j) where |i-j| ≤ 1 except for (42, 42) are valid scenarios.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Logic for Valid Scenarios**: The program attempts to count valid starting and ending positions for Alice's token. However, the logic for determining valid scenarios is flawed. Specifically, the conditions used to increment the `res` counter do not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions used to check if a scenario is valid are overly restrictive and do not account for all possible valid moves. For example, the condition `if counter[i + 1][0] == -1 or counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]:` is not sufficient to ensure that Alice can move to an adjacent cell after answering "NO" to all questions.

3. **Example Counterexample**: Consider the input `n=5, k=3` with Bob's questions being `x = [5, 1, 4]`. According to the problem statement, the valid scenarios are `(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)`. However, the provided program counts fewer scenarios than this. For instance, the scenario `(2, 3)` is not correctly identified as valid by the program.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly track the positions where Alice can move her token and ensure that the conditions for valid scenarios are accurately checked. A more detailed and accurate implementation is needed to handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
