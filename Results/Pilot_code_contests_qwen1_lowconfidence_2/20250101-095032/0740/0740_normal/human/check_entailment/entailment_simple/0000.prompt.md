You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with n cells. There are n cells labeled from 1 through n. For each i from 1 to n-1, cells i and i+1 are adjacent.

Alice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is. 

Bob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers x_1, x_2, …, x_k in order. In the i-th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell x_i. That is, Alice can answer either "YES" or "NO" to each Bob's question.

At most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Note that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.

You are given n and Bob's questions x_1, …, x_k. You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. 

Let (a,b) denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell a and ends at cell b. Two scenarios (a_i, b_i) and (a_j, b_j) are different if a_i ≠ a_j or b_i ≠ b_j.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5) — the number of cells and the number of questions Bob asked.

The second line contains k integers x_1, x_2, …, x_k (1 ≤ x_i ≤ n) — Bob's questions.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions.

Examples

Input


5 3
5 1 4

4 8
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1


Output


0


Input


100000 1
42


Output


299997

Note

The notation (i,j) denotes a scenario where Alice starts at cell i and ends at cell j.

In the first example, the valid scenarios are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5). For example, (3,4) is valid since Alice can start at cell 3, stay there for the first three questions, then move to cell 4 after the last question. 

(4,5) is valid since Alice can start at cell 4, stay there for the first question, the move to cell 5 for the next two questions. Note that (4,5) is only counted once, even though there are different questions that Alice can choose to do the move, but remember, we only count each pair of starting and ending positions once.

In the second example, Alice has no valid scenarios.

In the last example, all (i,j) where |i-j| ≤ 1 except for (42, 42) are valid scenarios.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
