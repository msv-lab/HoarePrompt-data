Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to calculate the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Scenarios**:
   - The code uses a `counter` list to track the first and last occurrence indices of each cell in `x`. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that Alice can move her token to adjacent cells between questions.
   - The logic for counting scenarios does not properly handle the movement of the token to adjacent cells, which is crucial for determining valid scenarios where Alice can answer "NO" to all questions.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem Constraints**:
   - The problem requires counting scenarios where Alice can avoid answering "YES" to any of Bob's questions. The current implementation does not consider the adjacency constraint and the ability to move to adjacent cells.
   - The logic provided in `func_1` does not reflect the dynamic nature of Alice's movements and does not correctly compute the number of valid scenarios.

3. **Lack of Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when Alice starts at the boundary cells (1 or n) and needs to move to adjacent cells.
   - It also does not consider scenarios where Alice might start in the middle and needs to move to both adjacent cells to avoid answering "YES".

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem, leading to incorrect results for various test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
