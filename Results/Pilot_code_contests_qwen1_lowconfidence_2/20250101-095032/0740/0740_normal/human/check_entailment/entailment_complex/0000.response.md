Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not consider the possibility that Alice might move her token to an adjacent cell before answering the first question or after answering the last question. This means the code only considers movements within the bounds of Bob's questions, which is not comprehensive.

To illustrate this, consider the following case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  5 3
  5 1 4
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  9
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The code might incorrectly output a lower number because it does not account for the scenarios where Alice moves her token before the first question or after the last question.

For instance, in the given example, the valid scenarios include moving the token before the first question or after the last question, such as starting at cell 1 and ending at cell 2, or starting at cell 4 and ending at cell 5. The code should account for these scenarios to ensure correctness.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it fails to consider all possible movement scenarios as per the problem description.
