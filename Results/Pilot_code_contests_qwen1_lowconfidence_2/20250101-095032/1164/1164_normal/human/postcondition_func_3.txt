The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it prompts the user to input some text, which is then returned by the function. This means that after the function executes, the program will have received user input, which can be stored in a variable or used further in the program. Potential edge cases include the user pressing Enter without typing anything, resulting in an empty string being returned. There is no explicit handling for non-string inputs, although the `input()` function inherently provides a string.
