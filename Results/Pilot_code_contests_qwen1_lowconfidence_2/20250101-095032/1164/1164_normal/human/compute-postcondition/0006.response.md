`l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is a divisor of `n`, and `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1. The value of `i` is 1 (as stated in the initial state), so `l` will be updated to include `i`.

Therefore, the updated list `l` will contain `[1]`, and the other variables (`n`, `i`) retain their initial values as per the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list containing `[1]`, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `n`, and `(n // i != i)`**
