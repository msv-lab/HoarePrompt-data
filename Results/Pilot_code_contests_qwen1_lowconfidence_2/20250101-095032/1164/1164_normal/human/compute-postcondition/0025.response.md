Functionality: **The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n`. It achieves this by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`. For each number `i`, if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`), both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list `l`. If `i` is equal to `n // i`, it means `i` is a perfect square root of `n`, and it is only added once. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square, ensuring that the divisor is not duplicated. No other edge cases are explicitly handled within the function, but it naturally works correctly for all positive integers.**
