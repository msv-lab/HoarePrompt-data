The code appends `n // i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2 (since `sqrt(2) + 1` is approximately 2.414, which when converted to an integer is 2). 

Initially, `l` is `[2]`. After the code runs, `l` will become `[2, n // 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `l` is a list containing `[2, n // 2]`**
