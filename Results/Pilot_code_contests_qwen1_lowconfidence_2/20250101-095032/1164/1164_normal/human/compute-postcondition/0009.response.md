Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` starts at 1; `l` is a list. If `n % i == 0`, then `l` will contain either `[n // i]` if `n // i` equals `i`, or `[1, n // i]`. Since there is no else part, the list `l` remains unchanged in other cases.***
