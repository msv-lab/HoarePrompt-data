Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `l` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- For each `i`, if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`), it appends both `i` and `n // i` to the list `l`.
- Since the loop checks divisibility up to the square root of `n`, all factors of `n` are considered.
- If `n // i == i`, it means `i` is a perfect square root of `n`, and only `i` is appended once.
- Otherwise, both `i` and `n // i` are appended, ensuring all unique pairs of divisors are included.

### Final State:
After the loop completes all iterations, `l` will contain all unique divisors of `n` because every factor pair `(i, n // i)` is added to the list exactly once. Thus, the final output state is that `l` contains all unique divisors of `n`.
