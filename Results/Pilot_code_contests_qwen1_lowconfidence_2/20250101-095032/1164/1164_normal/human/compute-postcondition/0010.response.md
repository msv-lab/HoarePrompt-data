Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1.
   - `i` starts at 1.
   - `l` is a list.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` (exclusive).

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `n % i == 0`, then `l` will be updated based on the value of `n // i`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently at some value `k` where `1 â‰¤ k < int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - `l` contains either `[n // k]` if `n // k` equals `k`, or `[1, n // k]`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k + 1`.
   - The new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

6. **Condition Check for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `k + 1` is still less than `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.

7. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `l` remains the same unless the condition `n % (k + 1) == 0` is met, in which case it will be updated accordingly.

Given the above reasoning, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `i` is now `k + 1`.
- `l` remains unchanged unless the condition `n % (k + 1) == 0` is met.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we'll keep it in terms of `k`:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is `k + 1`; `l` is a list.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration (you can replace `k` with any valid value):

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `l` is a list.**

To generalize:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is `k + 1`; `l` is a list.**

If we need a specific example, we can say:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `l` is a list.**
