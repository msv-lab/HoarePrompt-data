The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 3, the list `l` will now contain the value 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition regarding `l` (whether it contains `[2, n // 3]` or `[2]`) also remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 3; `l` is a list containing `[2, 3]` if `n` is divisible by 3, otherwise `[2, 3]`**
