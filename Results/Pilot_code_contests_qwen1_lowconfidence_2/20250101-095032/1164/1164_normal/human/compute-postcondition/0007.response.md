`l.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is a divisor of `n` and `(n // i != i)`, this means `n // i` is another divisor of `n` different from `i`. The list `l` initially contains `[1]`, and since `i` is 1, `n // 1` is simply `n` itself. However, the condition `(n // i != i)` ensures that `i` is not equal to `n`, meaning `n` is not added to the list again.

Therefore, the list `l` now contains `[1, n // i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `l` is a list containing `[1, n // i]`**
