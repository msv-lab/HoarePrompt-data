The code `l.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is initially 3, `n // i` will be `n // 3`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `l` is a list containing `[2, 3]` if `n` is divisible by 3, otherwise `[2, 3]`.

Since `l` is `[2, 3]` regardless of whether `n` is divisible by 3 or not, the value of `l` before appending is `[2, 3]`. After appending `n // 3` to `l`, the list `l` will become `[2, 3, n // 3]`.

The updated values of the variables are:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1.
- `i` remains 3.
- `l` is now `[2, 3, n // 3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 3; `l` is `[2, 3, n // 3]`**
