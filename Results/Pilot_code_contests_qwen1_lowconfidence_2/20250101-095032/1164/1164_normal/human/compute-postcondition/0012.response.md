`l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `l`. The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1, and the value of `i` remains 2. Therefore, the list `l` now contains the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `l` is a list containing [2]**
