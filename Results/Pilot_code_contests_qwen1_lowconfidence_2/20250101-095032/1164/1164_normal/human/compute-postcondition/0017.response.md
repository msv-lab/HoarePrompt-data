`l.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list `l`. Since `i` is 3, appending 3 to `l` means `l` becomes `[2, n // 3, 3]` if `n` is divisible by 3, or `[2, 3]` otherwise. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 3; `l` is either `[2, n // 3, 3]` if `n` is divisible by 3, or `[2, 3]` otherwise.**
