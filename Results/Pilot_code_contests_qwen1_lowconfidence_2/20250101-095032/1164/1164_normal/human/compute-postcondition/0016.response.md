Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is a list. Depending on the value of `n` and `i`, `l` could be either `[2]` or `[2, n // 2]`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.

4. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `3` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - The condition for the list `l` remains the same as it depends on the values of `n` and `i` which haven't changed yet.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` is still a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `l` is still a list. It will remain `[2]` if `n % 3 != 0` or `[2, n // 3]` if `n % 3 == 0`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 3; `l` is a list. If `n` is divisible by `3`, then `l` is a list containing `[2, n // 3]`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing `[2]`**.
