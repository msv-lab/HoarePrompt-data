`l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n // i`, appending `i` to the list `l` means that `l` now contains `[n // i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `l` is an empty list plus the element `n // i`; the current value of `i` is equal to `n // i`**
