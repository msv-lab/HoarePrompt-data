According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the range function used in the `for` loop. The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) the value of `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1. This ensures there is at least one value for `i` to iterate over.

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `math.sqrt(n) + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `math.sqrt(n)` must be at least 0. Since `n` is a positive integer, `math.sqrt(n)` is at least 1, making `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` at least 2.
2. `i` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.

Therefore, the initial state should be adjusted to ensure the loop can start executing properly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1, `i` starts at 1, and `l` is an empty list**
