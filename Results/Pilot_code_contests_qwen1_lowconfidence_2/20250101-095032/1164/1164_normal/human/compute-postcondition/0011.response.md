`l.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` or the condition that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1, nor does it change the value of `i`. The list `l` now contains the element 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is greater than 1; `i` is 2; `l` is a list containing 2.**
