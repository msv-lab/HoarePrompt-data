You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

You have to construct two sequences of integers b and c with length n that satisfy:

  * for every i (1≤ i≤ n) b_i+c_i=a_i 
  * b is non-decreasing, which means that for every 1<i≤ n, b_i≥ b_{i-1} must hold 
  * c is non-increasing, which means that for every 1<i≤ n, c_i≤ c_{i-1} must hold 



You have to minimize max(b_i,c_i). In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences b and c.

Also there will be q changes, the i-th change is described by three integers l,r,x. You should add x to a_l,a_{l+1}, …, a_r. 

You have to find the minimum possible value of max(b_i,c_i) for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1≤ n≤ 10^5).

The secound line contains n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (1≤ i≤ n, -10^9≤ a_i≤ 10^9).

The third line contains an integer q (1≤ q≤ 10^5).

Each of the next q lines contains three integers l,r,x (1≤ l≤ r≤ n,-10^9≤ x≤ 10^9), desribing the next change. 

Output

Print q+1 lines.

On the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ q+1) line, print the answer to the problem for the sequence after i-1 changes.

Note

In the first test:

  * The initial sequence a = (2, -1, 7, 3). Two sequences b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,2,2,-2) is a possible choice. 
  * After the first change a = (2, -4, 4, 0). Two sequences b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,-1,-1,-5) is a possible choice. 
  * After the second change a = (2, -4, 6, 2). Two sequences b=(-4,-4,6,6),c=(6,0,0,-4) is a possible choice. 
Program:
```
def func_8(n):
    global prime
    prime = [True for i in range(n + 1)]
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if prime[p] == True:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    f = []
    for p in range(2, n):
        if prime[p]:
            f.append(p)
    return f
```
