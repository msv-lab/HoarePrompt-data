The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `p`, both of which are integers greater than 1. It computes and returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \). This computation is performed using the built-in `pow` function in Python, which efficiently calculates the modular exponentiation. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that both `n` and `p` are greater than 1. If either `n` or `p` is less than or equal to 1, the behavior of the function is undefined because the preconditions are not met. The function does not handle these cases, and the use of `pow` with the third argument (for modulus) ensures that the result is always an integer within the range of 0 to \( p-1 \).
