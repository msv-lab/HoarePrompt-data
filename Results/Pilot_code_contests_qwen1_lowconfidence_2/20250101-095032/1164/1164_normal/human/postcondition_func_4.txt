The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer value representing the number of elements in a sequence. It then returns this integer value. This integer is expected to be used as the size of the sequence that the calling code will subsequently handle. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code; however, it is assumed that the user will provide a valid integer input, and the function will behave as expected. If the user were to input a non-integer value, the `input()` function would raise a `ValueError`, which is not handled within this function.
