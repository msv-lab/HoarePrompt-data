The function `func_6` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). It performs the following actions:

1. It first takes the absolute values of `x` and `y`.
2. If the minimum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` is 0, it returns the maximum of the absolute values of `x` and `y`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result.

The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns either the maximum value between the absolute values of `x` and `y` (if the minimum of the absolute values is 0) or the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the minimum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` is 0 and returns the maximum value between them.
- The function correctly calculates the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; however, it is worth noting that the function assumes the inputs are valid integers within the specified range.
