The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. These integers are derived from the space-separated integers returned by `func_4()`, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This process transforms the string output of `func_4()` into a list of integers. Potential edge cases include `func_4()` returning an empty string or non-space-separated integers, which would result in an empty list or a ValueError, respectively. If `func_4()` fails to return a string at all, the function will also raise a TypeError.
