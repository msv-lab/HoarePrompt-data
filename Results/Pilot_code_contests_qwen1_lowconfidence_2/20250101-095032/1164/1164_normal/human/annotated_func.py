#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1, and p is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \) where \( n \) is an integer greater than 1 and \( p \) is an integer greater than 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `p`, both of which are integers greater than 1. It computes and returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \). This computation is performed using the built-in `pow` function in Python, which efficiently calculates the modular exponentiation. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that both `n` and `p` are greater than 1. If either `n` or `p` is less than or equal to 1, the behavior of the function is undefined because the preconditions are not met. The function does not handle these cases, and the use of `pow` with the third argument (for modulus) ensures that the result is always an integer within the range of 0 to \( p-1 \).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information provided about the variables in the function signature for `func_2`. The function `func_4` is assumed to exist and return a string containing space-separated integers, which are then converted to a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`.
def func_2():
    return map(int, func_4().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated integers returned by `func_4()` into a list using `map(int, ...)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. These integers are derived from the space-separated integers returned by `func_4()`, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This process transforms the string output of `func_4()` into a list of integers. Potential edge cases include `func_4()` returning an empty string or non-space-separated integers, which would result in an empty list or a ValueError, respectively. If `func_4()` fails to return a string at all, the function will also raise a TypeError.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_3` are provided or defined within the snippet. The function does not take any parameters and it returns a list of integers obtained from `func_4()`.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_4().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from calling `func_4().split()` and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by calling `func_4()`, which presumably returns a string. This string is then split into substrings using the `split()` method, and each substring is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting map object is then converted to a list. If `func_4()` returns an empty string, the resulting list will also be empty. If `func_4()` returns a string with multiple substrings separated by whitespace, the resulting list will contain multiple integers. If `func_4()` returns a string with non-integer values, those substrings will not be included in the final list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters or return any value, which suggests it is not directly related to solving the given problem. However, for the context of the problem, we assume it is part of a larger program and should be ignored for the precondition extraction.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns the user's input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it prompts the user to input some text, which is then returned by the function. This means that after the function executes, the program will have received user input, which can be stored in a variable or used further in the program. Potential edge cases include the user pressing Enter without typing anything, resulting in an empty string being returned. There is no explicit handling for non-string inputs, although the `input()` function inherently provides a string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, but based on the context, the function reads an integer input which represents the number of elements in the sequence (n).
def func_5():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user representing the number of elements in the sequence
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer value representing the number of elements in a sequence. It then returns this integer value. This integer is expected to be used as the size of the sequence that the calling code will subsequently handle. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code; however, it is assumed that the user will provide a valid integer input, and the function will behave as expected. If the user were to input a non-integer value, the `input()` function would raise a `ValueError`, which is not handled within this function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func_6(x, y):
    x = abs(x)
    y = abs(y)
    if (min(x, y) == 0) :
        return max(x, y)
        #The program returns the maximum value between x (which is the absolute value of its original value) and y (which is the absolute value of its original value), given that the minimum of x and y is 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is the absolute value of its original value, `y` is the absolute value of its original value, and neither `x` nor `y` is zero
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). It performs the following actions:

1. It first takes the absolute values of `x` and `y`.
2. If the minimum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` is 0, it returns the maximum of the absolute values of `x` and `y`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result.

The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns either the maximum value between the absolute values of `x` and `y` (if the minimum of the absolute values is 0) or the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the minimum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` is 0 and returns the maximum value between them.
- The function correctly calculates the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; however, it is worth noting that the function assumes the inputs are valid integers within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_7(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                l.append(i)
            else:
                l.append(i)
                l.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer; `l` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n`.
    return l
    #`The program returns the list 'l' containing all unique divisors of the positive integer 'n'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n`. It achieves this by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`. For each number `i`, if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`), both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list `l`. If `i` is equal to `n // i`, it means `i` is a perfect square root of `n`, and it is only added once. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is a perfect square, ensuring that the divisor is not duplicated. No other edge cases are explicitly handled within the function, but it naturally works correctly for all positive integers.
