The function `func_5` accepts five parameters: `n` (an integer representing the index of the current node), `d` (a dictionary mapping some nodes to lists of child nodes), `v` (a list of booleans used as a visited flag), `a` (a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the sum of values added to node `i` and its descendants), and `c` (an integer representing the initial value to add to the current node). The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree structure defined by `d`, marking nodes as visited in the `v` list. For each node, it calculates the sum of the values of its unvisited children and updates `a[n]` to this sum. If `n` is not in `d` or if `x` (the list of child nodes) is an empty list, `a[n]` remains unchanged and equals the original value. The function returns the updated value of `a[n]`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that `n` is a valid index within the bounds of `a` and `v`. If `n` is out of bounds, this would lead to an IndexError. This edge case should be handled externally before calling the function.
2. The function also assumes that `d` and `v` are correctly initialized and that `a` is a list of appropriate length. If these assumptions are not met, the behavior of the function could be unpredictable.
3. The function does not check if `c` is an integer. While the annotation suggests that `c` is an integer, the function itself does not enforce this constraint, which could lead to type-related issues.
4. The function updates `a[n]` in place, which means that if the function is called multiple times with the same `n`, the result might be incorrect if the previous state of `a[n]` is not preserved. This is because `a[n]` is directly modified during the DFS traversal.
5. The function does not handle the case where `v` might contain elements that are not booleans. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `v` is not properly initialized.
