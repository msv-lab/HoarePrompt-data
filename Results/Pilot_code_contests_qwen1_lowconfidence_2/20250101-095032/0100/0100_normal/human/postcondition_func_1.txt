The function `func_2` takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It accomplishes this by calling another function `func_3()`, which presumably returns a string. This string is then split into a list of substrings, and each substring is converted to an integer. The function does not handle any potential errors during the conversion process, such as non-integer values in the string. Therefore, if `func_3()` returns a string containing non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code that need to be considered specifically, as the core functionality is straightforward.
