The function `func_4` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no parameters accepted by the function. This function does not perform any validation on the input to ensure it is indeed an integer. Therefore, if the user enters something other than an integer, the program will raise a `ValueError`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has stored the integer input provided by the user in the return value.
