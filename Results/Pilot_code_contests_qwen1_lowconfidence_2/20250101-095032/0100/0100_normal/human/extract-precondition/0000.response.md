Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and mod is a positive integer.** 

Note: The provided function `func_7` does not seem to directly relate to the problem description. It appears to be a helper function for calculating factorials modulo some number, which is not used in the given example solution for the problem. The precondition I have provided is based on the variables `n` and `mod` in the function signature.
