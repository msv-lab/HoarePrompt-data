The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the results of `func_4()` and `func_2()` to initialize `n` and `a` respectively. It then performs a series of operations on the list `a` and prints intermediate and final results. Here is a detailed breakdown of the function's final state after it concludes:

1. It initializes `n` using the result of `func_4()` and `a` using the result of `func_2()`.
2. It prints `1 1` and calculates `x` as `n - a[0] % n`.
3. It updates `a[0]` to `a[0] + n - x`.
4. If `n > 1`, it iterates over the list `a` starting from index 1 and constructs a new list `b` where each element `b[i]` is calculated as `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, then updates `a[i]` to `a[i] + b[i - 1]`.
5. It prints the elements of `b` as a space-separated sequence.
6. If `n == 1`, it prints `1 1` and `0` without modifying `a`.
7. If `n > 1`, it prints `1 n` and then iterates over `a` to negate each element.
8. Finally, it prints the negated list `a`.

Edge cases:
- If `n <= 1`, the function handles it by printing `1 1` and `0` without further modifications to `a`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `n > 1` by updating `a` and `b` accordingly.
