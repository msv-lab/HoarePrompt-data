The function `func_3()` accepts no parameters and simply returns the input provided by the user through the `input()` function. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the user's input as a string. There are no additional actions performed by the function. This means that if the user provides any input (such as a number, a word, or a combination of characters), the function will return exactly that input without any modification. No edge cases are handled within the function itself; it relies solely on the user-provided input.
