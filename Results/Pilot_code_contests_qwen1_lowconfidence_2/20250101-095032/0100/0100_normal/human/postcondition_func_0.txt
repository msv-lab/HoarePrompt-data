The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns a map object. This map object contains integers derived from splitting a string returned by `func_3()` and converting each resulting substring into an integer. If `func_3()` returns an empty string, the map object will also be empty. However, if `func_3()` returns a string containing multiple substrings separated by whitespace, these substrings will be converted to integers and included in the map object. There is no explicit handling for non-integer substrings in the split string; such cases would raise a `ValueError`.
