The code `print(2, n)` prints the integer `2` followed by the value of `n`. The value of `n` is the return value of `func_4()`, and it is stated that the current value of `n` is greater than 1. The print statement does not change the value of `n` or any other variables; it only outputs the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()` and is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`, and the print statement outputs `n - x`; the output is `2` followed by the value of `n`.**
