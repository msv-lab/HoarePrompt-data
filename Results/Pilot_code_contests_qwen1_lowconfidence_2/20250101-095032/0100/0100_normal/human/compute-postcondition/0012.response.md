According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n`. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`.
- `b` is a list containing the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- `x` is `n - 2`.
- `a[i]` is `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the values of `i` and ensure the conditions for the loop continue to be met.

1. **Increment `i`:** Since the loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
2. **Check the condition for the loop:** The loop continues as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x + 1`, which means `i` was equal to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `n`.

Given that `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, and the modified `a[i]`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but no such modification is specified in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`; `b` is a list containing the value `a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`; `x` is `n - 2`; `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`; `i` is `n`**
