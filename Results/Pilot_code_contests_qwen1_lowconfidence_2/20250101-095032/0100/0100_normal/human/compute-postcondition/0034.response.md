The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `a` is `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies `-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. 

Based on the provided information, there are no specific cases mentioned for the return values. Therefore, we need to infer that the function might return a single value or possibly a tuple containing multiple values based on the problem's context, but since no specific return values are given, we can only describe the input parameters.

Given the lack of explicit return details, the most accurate description would be:

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers, and the length of the list `a` is `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`), and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies `-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.**
