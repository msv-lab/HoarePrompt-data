Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is as follows:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is the return value of `func_2()` and `a[0] + n - (n - 2) = a[0] + 2`.
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `x` is `n - 2`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   b.append(a[i] % n * (n - 1))
   ```

3. Let's break down the impact of this code:
   - `b` is an empty list initially.
   - The code appends a value to `b`.
   - The value being appended is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

4. Analyze the expression `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`:
   - Since `a[0] + n - (n - 2) = a[0] + 2`, we know that `a[0] = 2 - n + (n - 2) = 0`. So, `a[0] = 0`.
   - However, the index `i` in `a[i]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` without knowing `i`. But regardless of the value of `i`, the expression simplifies to `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

5. The impact on the variables:
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `a` remains the return value of `func_2()`, but its specific contents are not changed by this line.
   - `b` now contains the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
   - `x` remains `n - 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `b` is a list containing the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `x` is `n - 2`**.
