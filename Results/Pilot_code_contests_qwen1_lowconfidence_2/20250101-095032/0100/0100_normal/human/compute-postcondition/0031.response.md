`a[i]` is assigned the value `-a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the code updates `a[2]` to `-a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a[0]` is the negation of its original value, `a[1]` is updated to `-a[1]`, `a[2]` is `-a[2]`, `x` is a value that allows `a[0] + n - x` to be a valid index, `i` is 2**
