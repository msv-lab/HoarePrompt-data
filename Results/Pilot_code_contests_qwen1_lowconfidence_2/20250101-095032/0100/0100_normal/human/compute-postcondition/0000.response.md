The code snippet `n = func_4()` assigns the return value of `func_4()` to `n`. Since `func_4()` is not defined in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact value that `n` will take. However, we know that initially, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`. After executing `n = func_4()`, the value of `n` will be whatever `func_4()` returns, and this value will still satisfy the condition `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()` and satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000**
