The code `print(*a)` prints the elements of the list `a`. However, the list `a` does not undergo any changes in this line of code. The other variables remain unchanged as well.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- Each element `a[i]` is the negation of its original value if `i < n`
- `x` is a value that allows `a[0] + n - x` to be a valid index
- `i` is `n-1`

The output of `print(*a)` will simply print the elements of `a`. Since no variables are updated or changed, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, each element `a[i]` is the negation of its original value if `i < n`, `x` is a value that allows `a[0] + n - x` to be a valid index, `i` is `n-1`**
