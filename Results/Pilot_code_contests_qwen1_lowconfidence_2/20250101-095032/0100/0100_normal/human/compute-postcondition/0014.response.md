The code `a[i] += b[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding the value of `b[i - 1]` to it. Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`
- `x` is `n - 2`
- `i` is `n`

First, let's determine the value of `b[i - 1]`. Since `i` is `n`, `i - 1` is `n - 1`. So, `b[i - 1]` is the second element of the list `b`, which is `(a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)`.

Next, the code updates `a[i]` by adding this value to `a[i]`. Since `i` is `n`, the updated value of `a[n]` is `a[n] + (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`; `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`; `x` is `n - 2`; `i` is `n`; `a[n]` is `a[n] + (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)`**.
