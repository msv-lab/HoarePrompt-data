`a[i]` is incremented by `b[i - 1]`. Given that `b` is a list containing the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, the value of `b[i - 1]` is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`. Therefore, `a[i]` becomes `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`. The values of `n`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`; `b` is a list containing the value `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`; `x` is `n - 2`; `a[i]` is `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`**
