The code `print(1, 1)` simply prints the numbers 1 and 1 as a space-separated sequence. Since the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are not directly modified by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`. `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1), ..., (a[1] + a[1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`, and `x` is `n - 2`. The output of `print(*b)` will be the elements of `b` printed as a space-separated sequence. If `n <= 1`, the variables retain their original states and no new values are assigned. The condition `n == 1` is met.**
