Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, and after the loop, `a[i]` for each valid index `i` is updated such that `a[i] = a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`; `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1), ..., (a[1] + a[1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`; `x` is `n - 2`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, so for each `i` in this range, `b.append(a[i] % n * (n - 1))` and `a[i] += b[i - 1]`.
- After the loop completes, `a[i]` for each valid index `i` will be updated according to the formula `a[i] = a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` because `b[i - 1]` will always be `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- `b` will contain the values computed during each iteration, starting from `a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)` and ending with `(a[1] + a[1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)`.
- `x` remains `n - 2` as it is not affected by the loop.
- The loop will execute at least once if `n > 1`, and if `n == 1`, the loop does not execute, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
