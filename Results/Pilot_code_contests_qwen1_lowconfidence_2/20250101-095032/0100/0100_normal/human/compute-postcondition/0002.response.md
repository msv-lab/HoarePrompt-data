The code snippet prints the numbers 1 and 1. This does not change the values of the variables `n` and `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()` and satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`; the program prints 1 and 1.**
