The code `b = []` initializes an empty list `b`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or the print statement's output, which was already determined in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()` and is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`, and the print statement outputs `n - x`; the output is `2` followed by the value of `n`; `b` is an empty list.**
