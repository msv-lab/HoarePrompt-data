Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop.

### Initial State
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`
- `x` is `n - 2`
- `i` is `n`

### Key Update Operation
The code `a[i] += b[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding the value of `b[i - 1]` to it.

### Value of `b[i - 1]`
Given `i = n`, then `i - 1 = n - 1`. Therefore, `b[i - 1]` is the second element of the list `b`, which is `(a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)`.

### Updated `a[i]`
The updated value of `a[n]` is `a[n] + (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)`.

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.

### Current Iteration State
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`
- `x` is `n - 2`
- `i` is `n`

### Next Iteration
For the next iteration of the loop, `i` should be set to `1` because the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.

Since the loop condition is `i < n`, and we are starting a new iteration, the updated state will be:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`
- `x` is `n - 2`
- `i` is `1`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` is greater than 1; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`; `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`; `x` is `n - 2`; `i` is `1`**.
