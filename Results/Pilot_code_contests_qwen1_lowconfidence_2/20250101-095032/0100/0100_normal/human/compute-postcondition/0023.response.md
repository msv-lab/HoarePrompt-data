The code `print(0)` simply prints the number 0. It does not assign any new values to variables or change the existing ones. Since the precondition states that `n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`, and `b` is a list constructed from `a` according to certain conditions, these values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`, `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1), ..., (a[1] + a[1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`, and `x` is `n - 2`.**
