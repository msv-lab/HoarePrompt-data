The code `print(*b)` prints the elements of list `b`. Since `b` is defined as a list containing the values calculated from `a`, let's break down the changes to `a` first.

From the initial state:
- `a[i]` for each valid index `i` is updated such that `a[i] = a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1), ..., (a[1] + a[1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`.

After the loop, the value of `a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated. However, the exact values of `a[i]` before and after the loop are not specified, but we know they follow the formula `a[i] = a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`. The list `b` is constructed using these updated values.

Since the exact values of `a` are not given, let's denote the updated values of `a` as `a_i'` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `b` is derived from these updated values.

The print statement will output the elements of `b` separated by spaces. Since the exact values of `a_i'` are not specified, the output will be in terms of the updated values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1), ..., (a[1] + a[1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`, and `x` is `n - 2`. The output of `print(*b)` will be the elements of `b` printed as a space-separated sequence.**
