Postcondition: ***`n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`. If `n <= 1`, the variables retain their original states and no new values are assigned. If `n == 1`, `b` is a list containing the values `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), (a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1), ..., (a[1] + a[1] % n * (n - 1)) % n * (n - 1)]`. If `n > 1`, each element `a[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, and `b` is updated accordingly. The output of `print(*b)` will be the elements of `b` printed as a space-separated sequence.***
