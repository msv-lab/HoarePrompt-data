The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is the return value of `func_4()`
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `x` is `a[0] % n`
- The print statement outputs `n - x`

The code snippet updates the first element of list `a`:
```python
a[0] += n - x
```

From the initial state:
- `x = a[0] % n`
- Therefore, `n - x` is printed, which means `n - (a[0] % n)`

After executing `a[0] += n - x`, the first element of `a` will be updated to:
- `a[0] = a[0] + (n - (a[0] % n))`

Since `a[0] % n` is equivalent to `x`, we can rewrite the equation as:
- `a[0] = a[0] + (n - x)`

Therefore, the new value of `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`.

The output state remains as:
- `n` is the return value of `func_4()`
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, but its first element is updated to `a[0] + n - x`
- The print statement outputs `n - x`

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`, and the print statement outputs `n - x`.**
