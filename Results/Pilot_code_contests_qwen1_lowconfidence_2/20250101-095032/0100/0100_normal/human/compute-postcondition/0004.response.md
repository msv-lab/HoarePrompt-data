`n - x` is calculated and printed. From the initial state, `x` is defined as `a[0] % n`. The print statement outputs the value of `n - x`.

Since `n` is the return value of `func_4()` and `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, and given that `x` is `a[0] % n`, the value of `x` is derived from these functions. However, the exact values of `n` and `a` are not specified, so we can only express `n - x` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `x` is `a[0] % n`, and the print statement outputs `n - x`.**
