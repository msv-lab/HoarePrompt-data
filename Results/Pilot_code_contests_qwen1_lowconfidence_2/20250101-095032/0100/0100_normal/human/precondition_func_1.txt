None of the variables (n, a) are mentioned in the function signature of `func_2`, and thus no direct information about their types or values can be inferred from `func_2` itself. However, based on the problem description, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
