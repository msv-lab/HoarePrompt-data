Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'.
   - `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, with `power[0]` being `0`, and `power[pos]` being non-zero.

2. The code snippet updates `power[pos]` and `pos` as follows:
   ```python
   power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
   ```

3. Let's analyze the update step-by-step:
   - `power[pos]` is set to `0`.
   - The new value of `pos` is calculated using the expression `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

4. Break down the expression:
   - `(field[pos] == '>')` evaluates to `True` if `field[pos]` is '>', otherwise `False`.
   - `2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1` evaluates to `1` if `field[pos]` is '>', otherwise `-1`.
   - The term `power[pos]` is non-zero, so multiplying `power[pos]` by `1` or `-1` changes its sign.

5. Putting it together:
   - `power[pos]` is updated to `0`.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + 1` if `field[pos]` is '>', or `pos - 1` if `field[pos]` is '<'.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power[0]` is `0`, `power[pos]` is `0`, `pos` is updated to `pos + 1` if `field[pos]` is '>', or `pos - 1` if `field[pos]` is '<'.**
