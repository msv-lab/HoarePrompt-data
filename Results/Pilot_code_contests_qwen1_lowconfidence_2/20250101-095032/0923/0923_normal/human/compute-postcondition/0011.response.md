The code `print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')` checks the condition `0 <= pos < n`. If the condition is true, it prints 'INFINITE', otherwise it prints 'FINITE'. This does not change any variables but evaluates the condition using the current values of `pos` and `n`.

- If `0 <= pos < n` is true, then `pos` is within the bounds of `n`, and the output will be 'INFINITE'.
- If `0 <= pos < n` is false, then `pos` is outside the bounds of `n`, and the output will be 'FINITE'.

Since no variables are updated, the only thing that changes is the print statement based on the condition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted with all elements set to `0`, `pos` is `n`, the printed value is 'FINITE' if `pos` is not in the range `[0, n)` and 'INFINITE' if `pos` is in the range `[0, n)`.**
