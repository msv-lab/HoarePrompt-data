Let's go through the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'.
   - `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, with `power[0]` being non-zero.
   - `pos` is `0`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The first part of the assignment updates `power[pos]` to `0`.
   - The second part updates `pos` using the formula `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

Since `pos` is initially `0`, let's evaluate the second part of the assignment:
   - `field[pos]` (where `pos` is `0`) will be `field[0]`.
   - If `field[0]` is `'>', (2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1) * power[0]` evaluates to `(2 * 1 - 1) * power[0] = 1 * power[0] = power[0]`.
   - If `field[0]` is `'<'`, (2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1) * power[0] evaluates to `(2 * 0 - 1) * power[0] = -1 * power[0] = -power[0]`.

Therefore:
- `power[0]` is set to `0`.
- `pos` is updated to `0 + (value based on field[0]) * 0 = 0`.

Since `power[0]` is set to `0`, the second part of the assignment does not change the value of `pos`.

**Output State:**
- `n` remains an integer read from input.
- `field` remains a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'.
- `power` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, with `power[0]` now being `0`.
- `pos` remains `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted with `power[0]` being `0`, `pos` is `0`.**
