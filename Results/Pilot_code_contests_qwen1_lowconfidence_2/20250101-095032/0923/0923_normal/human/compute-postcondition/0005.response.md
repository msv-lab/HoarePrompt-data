Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is an integer read from input
   - `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'
   - `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, and `power[0]` is non-zero
   - `pos` is 0

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
   ```

3. Break down the code:
   - `power[pos]` is set to 0.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

4. Since `pos` is initially 0, let's evaluate the second part of the assignment:
   - `field[pos]` is `field[0]`.
   - `(field[0] == '>')` will be either `True` or `False`.
   - If `field[0] == '>'`, then `(field[0] == '>')` is `True`, which is `1`.
   - If `field[0] == '<`, then `(field[0] == '>')` is `False`, which is `0`.
   - `2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1` will be `1` if `field[0] == '>'` and `-1` if `field[0] == '<`.
   - Therefore, `pos` will be updated to `0 + 1 * power[0]` if `field[0] == '>'` or `0 + (-1) * power[0]` if `field[0] == '<`.

5. Since `power[0]` is non-zero, let's denote it as `p` (where `p != 0`).

6. So, `pos` will be updated to `p` if `field[0] == '>'` or `-p` if `field[0] == '<`.

7. After executing the code, the updated states are:
   - `power[0]` is now `0`
   - `pos` is either `p` or `-p` depending on the value of `field[0]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted with `power[0]` being 0, `pos` is `power[0]` (which is 0) plus `2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1` times `power[0]` (which results in either `p` or `-p`)**.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted with `power[0]` being 0, `pos` is either `power[0]` + `2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1` \* `power[0]` (which results in either `p` or `-p`) where `p` is the original value of `power[0]`**.
