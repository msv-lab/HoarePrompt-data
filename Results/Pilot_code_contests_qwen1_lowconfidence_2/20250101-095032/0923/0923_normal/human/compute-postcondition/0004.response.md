Let's break down the conditions for the loop to execute at least once:

The loop condition is:
\[ 0 \leq pos < n \text{ and } power[pos] \neq 0 \]

Currently, we have the following state:
- `n` is an integer read from input
- The string `field` is the input string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'
- `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted
- `pos` is 0

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the loop condition with `pos` set to 0.

1. **Condition 1: \(0 \leq pos < n\)**

   - With `pos` being 0, this condition is already satisfied because \(0 \leq 0 < n\) as long as `n > 0`.

2. **Condition 2: \(power[pos] \neq 0\)**

   - Currently, `pos` is 0, so the condition checks if `power[0] \neq 0`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `power[0]` must be non-zero. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `power[0]` is not zero.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is an integer read from input
- The string `field` is the input string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'
- `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, and `power[0]` is non-zero
- `pos` is 0

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer read from input, the string `field` is the input string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted and `power[0]` is non-zero, `pos` is 0**
