Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step-by-step:

### Given Information:
- The `while` loop condition is `0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
  - `n` is an integer read from input.
  - `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'.
  - `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, with `power[0]` being 0.
  - `pos` is either `power[0]` + `2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1` \* `power[0]`, resulting in either `p` or `-p`, where `p` is the original value of `power[0]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `power[0]` = 0.
   - `pos` is calculated as `0 + 2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1` * 0, which simplifies to either `0` or `-0`, meaning `pos` is `0`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `0 <= pos < n` and `power[pos] != 0`.

3. **Current State**:
   - `0 <= pos < n` means `pos` is within the bounds of the list `power`.
   - `power[pos] != 0` must hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `power[pos]` must be non-zero at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `pos` is `0`, the condition becomes `power[0] != 0`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Initially, `power[0]` was set to `0`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `power[0]` must be non-zero at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `power[0]` is non-zero.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted with `power[0]` being non-zero, `pos` is `0`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0` holds true for the next iteration.
