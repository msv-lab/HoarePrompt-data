To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The loop condition is:
```
while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `0 <= pos < n`: This ensures that `pos` is within the bounds of the list `power`.
   - `power[pos] != 0`: This checks that the element at position `pos` in the `power` list is not zero.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` remains an integer read from input.
   - `field` remains a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'.
   - `power` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, with `power[0]` now being `0`.
   - `pos` remains `0`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions must hold true:
     - `0 <= pos < n` should still be true.
     - `power[pos] != 0` should still be true.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The first condition (`0 <= pos < n`) is already satisfied since `pos` starts at `0` and `n` is read from input.
   - To satisfy the second condition (`power[pos] != 0`), `power[pos]` must be non-zero.

5. **Considering the Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `pos` will increment (if it hasn't reached the end of the list yet).
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `power[pos]` is non-zero for at least one value of `pos` within the bounds.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `power[pos]` must be non-zero. Since `pos` starts at `0` and we need to ensure that `power[pos]` is non-zero, the state must be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

### Output State:
State: **`n` remains an integer read from input, `field` remains a string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', `power` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, with `power[0]` now being `0`, and `power[pos]` must be non-zero**.

Note: The exact value of `pos` for which `power[pos]` must be non-zero is not specified, but it must exist within the range `0 <= pos < n`.
