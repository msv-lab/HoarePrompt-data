The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, a string, and a list of integers. The constraints are that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, the string has a length of `n` and consists only of the characters '<' and '>', and the list contains `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

Based on the given information, there are no specific return cases mentioned, so we can infer that the function's return value is not explicitly stated beyond the parameter definitions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n`, a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>', and a list of `n` integers, and return some unspecified result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>', and a list of `n` integers, and returns an unspecified result based on these inputs.**
