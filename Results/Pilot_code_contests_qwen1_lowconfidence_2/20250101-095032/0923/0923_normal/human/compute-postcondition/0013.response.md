Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>', and a list of `n` integers. It simulates a movement on a string where each character represents a direction ('<' for left, '>' for right), and the integer values in the list represent the power of each step. The function iterates through the string, updating the position and power according to the direction indicated by each character. If the position becomes out of bounds or the power becomes zero before the end of the string, the function prints 'FINITE'. Otherwise, it prints 'INFINITE' after processing the entire string. This behavior accounts for potential edge cases such as reaching the end of the string or having a power of zero before completing the traversal.**
