The code `n = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, the input must be an integer within this range. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only say that `n` is now an integer read from input.

The string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>' remains unchanged, and the list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, the string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>' remains unchanged, and the list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, remains unchanged.**
