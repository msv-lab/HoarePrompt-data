The code `power = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `power`. 

In the initial state, `n` is an integer read from input, the string `field` is the input string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', and the list of `n` integers remains unchanged.

After executing the code, `n` and `field` remain unchanged, but `power` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted. The initial list of `n` integers is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, the string `field` is the input string of length `n` containing only '<' and '>', and `power` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted.**
