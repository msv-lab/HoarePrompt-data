Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not handle the case where the grasshopper enters into an infinite loop. The output hints confirm that the program should check if the grasshopper's position has repeated, indicating a loop, but the current implementation only checks if the position is within bounds and if the power is non-zero. For the example:

```
Input:
3
>><
2 1 1
```

The grasshopper's path is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> ..., which indicates an infinite loop. However, the program incorrectly outputs "FINITE". Therefore, the program needs to detect such loops to correctly determine if the jumps are finite or infinite.
