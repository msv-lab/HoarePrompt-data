Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip and the power is still non-zero. According to the problem description and the output hints, the program should stop and print "FINITE" if the grasshopper jumps out of the strip, regardless of whether the power is zero or not. However, the current implementation updates the power to zero inside the loop, which means the program will incorrectly print "INFINITE" in cases where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip but the power is non-zero.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
&gt;&lt;&lt;
1 2 3
```
In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0 and jumps to the right with a power of 1, moving to position 1. From position 1, it jumps left with a power of 2, moving to position -1, which is out of bounds. Since the power is 2 (non-zero), the grasshopper should print "FINITE", but the current code will incorrectly print "INFINITE" because it updates the power to zero when the position goes out of bounds.
