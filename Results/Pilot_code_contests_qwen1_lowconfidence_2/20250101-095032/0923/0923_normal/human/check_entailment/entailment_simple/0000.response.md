Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the length of the strip.
   - It then reads a string `field` consisting of characters '<' and '>' indicating the direction of the jump from each cell.
   - Finally, it reads a list of integers `power` indicating the length of the jump from each cell.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program initializes the position `pos` to 0, representing the starting cell.
   - It uses a `while` loop to simulate the grasshopper's jumps as long as the current position `pos` is within the bounds of the strip (`0 <= pos < n`) and the jump length `power[pos]` is non-zero.
   - Inside the loop, the program updates the current position `pos` according to the direction specified by `field[pos]`. A '>' character means a positive jump, and a '<' character means a negative jump. The update formula `pos = pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` correctly computes the new position.
   - Once the grasshopper either jumps out of the strip or all jumps are completed (i.e., `power[pos]` becomes 0), the loop exits.
   - After the loop, the program checks whether the grasshopper is still within the strip. If `0 <= pos < n`, it prints "FINITE", indicating that the grasshopper eventually stops. Otherwise, it prints "INFINITE", indicating that the grasshopper continues jumping indefinitely.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the grasshopper might jump out of the strip by checking the bounds `0 <= pos < n` inside the loop.
   - It correctly sets `power[pos]` to 0 after each jump, ensuring that a cell is not reused for further jumps.
   - The logic accounts for both positive and negative jumps, covering all possible directions specified in the input.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary cases, the program is correct.
