Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to handle situations where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip but then jumps back into it, creating an infinite loop. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 2 1
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0, jumps 2 cells to the right (position 2), then 1 cell to the left (position 1), and finally 2 cells to the left (which would take it out of bounds if the code was correctly implemented). However, the current code does not check if the grasshopper has already visited a cell with a zero power before, which could indicate an infinite loop. 

The provided code updates the power to zero upon visiting a cell but does not keep track of which cells have already caused the grasshopper to exit the strip, leading to potential infinite loops not being detected. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
