Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the length of the strip (`n`), the direction string (`field`), and the list of jump lengths (`power`). These inputs match the problem's constraints and format.

2. **State Initialization**: The variable `pos` is initialized to 0, representing the starting position of the grasshopper.

3. **Loop Execution**: The while loop runs as long as the grasshopper's position is within bounds (i.e., `0 <= pos < n`) and there is still some power left to jump (`power[pos] != 0`). For each iteration:
   - The current jump power is set to 0 to prevent revisiting the cell.
   - The new position is calculated based on the direction (`'>'` for right, `'<'` for left). The expression `(2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1)` effectively converts the direction to a +1 or -1 multiplier.

4. **Termination Condition**: If the loop exits because the position goes out of bounds or the jump power is 0, the program prints "FINITE". Otherwise, if the loop would theoretically run indefinitely without exiting due to these conditions, it prints "INFINITE".

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all specified edge cases:
   - If the grasshopper jumps out of bounds, it prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper reaches a cell with zero power, it also prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper continues to jump within bounds and never hits a zero power or out-of-bounds condition, it would theoretically print "INFINITE", but since the loop will eventually terminate (as per the problem constraints), it will print "FINITE".

Given that the program accurately simulates the grasshopper's movement according to the problem's rules and constraints, and it properly handles all edge cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
