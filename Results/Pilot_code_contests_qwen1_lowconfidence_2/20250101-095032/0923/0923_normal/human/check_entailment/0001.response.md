Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error that causes it to misidentify some infinite loops as finite. Specifically, the program sets `power[pos]` to 0 after processing each jump, which can prematurely terminate the loop in some cases where the grasshopper should continue jumping indefinitely.

Consider the following example:
```
3
>>>
1 1 1
```
In this case, the grasshopper should theoretically jump forever because each jump will move it to the right and the boundary conditions are never met. However, the current implementation will incorrectly identify this as a finite sequence because once `pos` reaches 3 (which is out of bounds), the loop will exit even though the grasshopper would continue jumping inside the strip.

To fix this, we should remove the `power[pos] = 0` line to allow the grasshopper to continue jumping as long as it stays within the strip boundaries. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = 0
    visited = set()
    
    while 0 <= pos < n and pos not in visited:
        visited.add(pos)
        (power[pos], pos) = (power[pos], pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])
    
    print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')
```

With this modification, the program correctly identifies whether the grasshopper will continue jumping forever or stop at some point.
