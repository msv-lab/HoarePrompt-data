Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the grasshopper might enter into a loop, which would make the jump infinite. In the provided example:

```
Input:
3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1

Output:
FINITE
```

However, the correct output should be `INFINITE` because the grasshopper's path is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> ..., indicating an infinite loop. The program checks if the current position is within bounds but does not check for repeated positions, which is necessary to detect an infinite loop.
