The function takes two integers `r` and `c` as input, representing the dimensions of a 2D array. It first checks if both `r` and `c` are 1. If so, it prints `0` and ends. Otherwise, it swaps `r` and `c` if `c` is 1. Then, it creates a 2D list `l` with `r` rows and `c` columns, where each element is the product of corresponding elements from two lists: `b` (containing integers from 1 to `r + c`), and `b` shifted by `r`. Finally, it prints the 2D list either row-wise or column-wise depending on the initial value of `c` (whether it was swapped). If `c` was not swapped, it prints the list row-wise; otherwise, it prints the list column-wise. The function does not return anything.
