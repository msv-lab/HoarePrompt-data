`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, so `l[i][j]` refers to `l[1][1]`. The value of `s` is initially the string representation of `l[1][0]` followed by a space, which is `s = str(l[1][0]) + ' '`. Therefore, `s` will now be the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `l[1][1]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` must be greater than 0, `s` is `str(l[1][0]) + ' ' + str(l[1][1])`, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1**
