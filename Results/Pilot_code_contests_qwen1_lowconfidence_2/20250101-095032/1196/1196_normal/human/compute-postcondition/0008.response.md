Postcondition: ***`r` and `c` are integers within the range 1 to 500, and `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1. If `c` equals 1, then `r` becomes the original value of `c`, `c` becomes the original value of `r`, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, the values of `r`, `c`, and `flag` remain unchanged.***
