Postcondition: **`r` is the original value of `c`, `c` is the original value of `r`, `flag` is still `True`, `l` is a 2D list with `r` rows and `c` columns where each element is the product of `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `0 <= j < c` and `0 <= i < r`, `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`**
