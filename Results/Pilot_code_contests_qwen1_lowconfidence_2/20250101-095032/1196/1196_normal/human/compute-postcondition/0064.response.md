`s` is initially defined as `str(l[1][0]) + ' ' + str(l[1][1])`. The code `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` adds `str(l[i][j]) + ' '` to the existing value of `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `str(l[i][j])` is equivalent to `str(l[1][2])`.

Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `l[1][0]` and `l[1][1]`, they remain as they are. However, `s` is updated to include `str(l[1][2]) + ' '`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` must be greater than 0, `s` is `str(l[1][0]) + ' ' + str(l[1][1]) + str(l[1][2]) + ' '`, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1**
