According to the given for loop, the loop will iterate based on the value of `c`. The loop can only execute if `c` is greater than 0. Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `j` is initially set to 0, but this is the starting point of the loop.
- `c` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `s` is an empty string, and its value does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `l` is the original 2D list, and its value does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `flag` is `False`, and its value does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `i` is 1, and its value does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `c` must be greater than 0.

State: **`j` is 0, `c` must be greater than 0, `s` is an empty string, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1**
