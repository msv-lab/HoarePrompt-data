The code snippet `s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '` impacts the variable `s`. It appends the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space to `s`. However, the initial values and conditions for `l`, `i`, and `j` are not provided. Given the initial state that `j` is 0 and `c` must be greater than 0, we can only state that `j` is updated (if it was part of an array access), but its exact value remains unchanged from the initial state because no direct assignment to `j` is made in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 0; `c` must be greater than 0; `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` must be greater than 0; `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space.**
