According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `c`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `c` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `c`. Given that `j` is currently 1, `c` must be greater than 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this:

- `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
- `c` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`j` is 2, `c` must be greater than 1**
