`s` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The value of `i` is 1, and since `l` is a 2D list with `r` rows and `c` columns, `l[i][j]` refers to the element at the second row (since indexing starts at 0) and zeroth column (as `j` is 0). The value of `s` was originally `val + ' '`.

Therefore, the new value of `s` will be `val + l[1][0] + ' '`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is the original value, `r` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is the original value and must be greater than 0, `flag` is still `True`, `l` is a 2D list with `r` rows and `c` columns, `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 0, `s` is `val + l[1][0] + ' '`**
