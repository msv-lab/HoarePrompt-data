According to the given for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(r):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's analyze the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is `c-1`
- `c` is the original value of `c` (which is `r`)
- `s` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the `i-th` row of the `2D` list `l` separated by spaces
- `l` is the original `2D` list
- `flag` is `False`
- `s` is printed

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition `i < r` must still hold true. This means that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. The new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Given that `j` is `c-1` and `c` is `r`, `j` remains unchanged within the loop since it is only initialized at the start and not modified inside the loop.

The state of `s`, `l`, and `flag` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not mentioned here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`j` is `c-1`, `c` is `r`, `s` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the `(i_prev + 1)-th` row of the `2D` list `l` separated by spaces, `l` is the original `2D` list, `flag` is `False`, `s` is not yet printed**
