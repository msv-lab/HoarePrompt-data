The initial value of `l[i][j]` is \((b[i] \times b[r + 1])^2\). After executing `l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]`, the new value of `l[i][j]` will be \((b[i] \times b[r + 1])^2 \times (b[i] \times b[r + 2])\). This simplifies to \((b[i]^2 \times b[r + 1] \times b[r + 2])^2\).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` must be at least 1, `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < r - 1\), `l[i][j]` is \((b[i]^2 \times b[r + 1] \times b[r + 2])^2***
