Postcondition: ***`r` and `c` are integers within the range 1 to 500. If `r` is 1 and `c` is 1, then `r` remains 1 and `c` remains 1. Otherwise, `r` is the original value of `c`, `c` is the original value of `r`, and `flag` is still `False`. If `flag` is `False`, the output is the formatted printing of all elements in `l` row by row. If `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list with `r` rows and `c` columns where each element is the product of `b[i] * b[r + j]` for all `0 <= j < c` and `0 <= i < r`, `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is `c-1`, and `s` is the concatenation of all elements in the 2D list `l` across all columns, separated by spaces.***
