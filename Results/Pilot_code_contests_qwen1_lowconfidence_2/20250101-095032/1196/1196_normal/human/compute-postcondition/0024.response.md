According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `c`. If `j` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 1, and it must still be less than `c`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the provided information that are affected by the loop, we only need to update the state of `j`.

State: **`j` is 1, `l[i][0]` is updated to `l[i][0] * (b[i] * b[r])`**
