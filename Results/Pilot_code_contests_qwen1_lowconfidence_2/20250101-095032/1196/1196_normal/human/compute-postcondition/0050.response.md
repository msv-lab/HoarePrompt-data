`s` is a string that gets appended with the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The value of `i` is not specified, but since `j` is `r-1`, the code is appending the element at row `i` and column `r-1` of the 2D list `l` to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `r-1`, `c` is `r`, `s` is the original string plus the string representation of `l[i][r-1]` followed by a space, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `s` is not yet printed**
