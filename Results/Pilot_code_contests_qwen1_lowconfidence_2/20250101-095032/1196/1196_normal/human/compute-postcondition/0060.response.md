`s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. The value of `i` is 1 and the value of `j` is 0. Therefore, `s` will now include the string representation of `l[1][0]` followed by a space. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `c` must be greater than 0, `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[1][0]` followed by a space, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1**
