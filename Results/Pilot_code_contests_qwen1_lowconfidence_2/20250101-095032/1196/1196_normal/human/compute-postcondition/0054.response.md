`s` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. Given that `j` is `0`, the value of `l[i][j]` is the same as `l[i][0]`. The previous value of `s` is `the original string plus the string representation of `l[i][r]` followed by a space`. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be the original string plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][r]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`j` is `0`, `c` is `r`, `s` is the original string plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][r]` followed by a space, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `s` is not yet printed**
