Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is `r-1`
- `c` is `r`
- `s` is the original string plus the string representation of `l[i][r-1]` followed by a space
- `l` is the original 2D list
- `flag` is `False`
- `s` is not yet printed

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `c-1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `r-1`.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented from `r-1` to `r-1 + 1`, which means `j` should be `r`.
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, the loop will continue as long as `j < c`.

Given that `c` is `r`, and `j` is currently `r-1`, the next value of `j` will be `r`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` will be `r` (since it will be incremented from `r-1` to `r`).
- All other variables (`c`, `s`, `l`, `flag`, and whether `s` is printed) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is `r`, `c` is `r`, `s` is the original string plus the string representation of `l[i][r-1]` followed by a space, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `s` is not yet printed**
