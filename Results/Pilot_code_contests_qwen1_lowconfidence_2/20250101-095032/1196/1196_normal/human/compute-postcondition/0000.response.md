The code reads two integers separated by a space from the user input and assigns them to the variables `r` and `c`. Since the initial values of `r` and `c` are specified as integers between 1 and 500, after executing the code, these values will be updated based on the user input.

Output State: **`r` is the first integer input by the user, `c` is the second integer input by the user, and both are within the range 1 to 500.**
