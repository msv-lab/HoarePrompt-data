`s` is updated by adding the string representation of `l[i][j]` (which is `l[i][1]` since `j` is 1) followed by a space. The initial value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space. Therefore, the new value of `s` is the concatenation of its original value plus the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space. The values of `j` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `c` must be greater than 0; `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space**
