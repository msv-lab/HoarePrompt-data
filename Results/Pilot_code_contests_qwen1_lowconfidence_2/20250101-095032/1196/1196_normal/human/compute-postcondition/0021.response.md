The code `l[i][j] *= b[i] * b[r + j]` updates the value of `l[i][j]` by multiplying it with the product of `b[i]` and `b[r + j]`. However, the initial state does not provide the dimensions and values of `l`, `b`, and `r`. Since the initial state only mentions that `j` is `c - 1` and `c` must be greater than 0, we know that `j` is now `c - 1` and no other variables are updated. 

Output State: **`j` is `c - 1`**
