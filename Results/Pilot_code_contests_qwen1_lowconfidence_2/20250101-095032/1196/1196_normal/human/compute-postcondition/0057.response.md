According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `r`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `j` is 0
- `c` is `r`
- `s` is printed
- `l` is the original 2D list
- `flag` is `False`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < r` must still be true. Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, for the first iteration, `i` is 0 and the loop executes. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` must be 1.

So, `i` is increased by 1, making it 1, and the condition for the loop to continue (`i < r`) remains valid as long as `r` is greater than 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`j` is 0, `c` is `r`, `s` is printed, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1**
