Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `c` must be greater than 0
- `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[1][0]` followed by a space
- `l` is the original 2D list
- `flag` is `False`
- `i` is 1

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `c`.
2. **Current State**: `j` is 0 and `c` must be greater than 0. This means the loop can potentially execute if `c > 0`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `j`**: Since `j` starts from 0, it will increment by 1 in each iteration.
2. **New Value of `j`**: After the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
3. **Check Condition**: For the loop to continue executing, `j < c` must hold true. Since `j` is now 1, the condition becomes `1 < c`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` will be 1.
- `c` must still be greater than 0 (as it did before).
- `s` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations modify `s`.
- `l` remains the original 2D list because no operations modify `l`.
- `flag` remains `False` because no operations modify `flag`.
- `i` remains 1 because the loop does not affect `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 1, `c` must be greater than 0, `s` is an empty string plus the string representation of `l[1][0]` followed by a space, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1**
