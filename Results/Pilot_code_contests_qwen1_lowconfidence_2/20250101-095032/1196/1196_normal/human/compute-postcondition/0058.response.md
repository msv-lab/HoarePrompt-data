`s` is assigned an empty string `''`. The value of `s` changes, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0; `c` is `r`; `s` is an empty string; `l` is the original 2D list; `flag` is `False`; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` is `r`; `s` is an empty string; `l` is the original 2D list; `flag` is `False`; `i` is 1**
