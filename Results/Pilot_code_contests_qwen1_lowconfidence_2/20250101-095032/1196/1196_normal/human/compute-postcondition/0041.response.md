Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs based on the variable `j` and `c`.
   - The loop condition is `j < c`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `c` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `c`.
   - Currently, `j` is 0, so for the next iteration, `j` needs to be 1.
   - Since `c` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged.
   - `s` will be updated in the loop body, but we only need to consider its initial state for the next iteration, which is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space.

Based on these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `j` needs to be 1.
- `c` must still be greater than 0.
- `s` remains as the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space.

So, the final state is:
State: **`j` is 1, `c` must be greater than 0, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by a space**.
