`s` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `l[i][j]` followed by a space. From the initial state, `j` is equal to `r`, so `l[i][j]` is equivalent to `l[i][r]`. Therefore, `s` is updated by appending the string representation of `l[i][r]` followed by a space. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `r`, `c` is `r`, `s` is the original string plus the string representation of `l[i][r]` followed by a space, `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `s` is not yet printed**
