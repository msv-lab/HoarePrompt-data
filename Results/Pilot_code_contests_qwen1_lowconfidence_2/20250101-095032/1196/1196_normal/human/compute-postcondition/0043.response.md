According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `c`. If `j` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `c` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. Also, `c` must still be greater than 0 to allow the loop to continue.

Let's break down the relevant states:
- `j` must be 2.
- `c` must still be greater than 0.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, but it is mentioned that `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space. Since the loop body is omitted, we do not change this state.

State: **`j` is 2, `c` must be greater than 0, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the string representation of `l[i][0]` followed by the string representation of `l[i][1]` followed by a space**
