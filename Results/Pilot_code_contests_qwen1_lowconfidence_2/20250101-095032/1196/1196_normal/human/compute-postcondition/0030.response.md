Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `c` must be at least 1
   - `i` is within the range `0 <= i < r - 1`
   - `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(c):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `c-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `j` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - The condition `0 <= i < r - 1` remains unchanged as it does not depend on `j`.
   - `c` must still be at least 1.
   - `l[i][j]` is updated to `b[i] * b[r + j]` for the new value of `j`.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `c` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is still within the range `0 <= i < r - 1`.
   - `l[i][j]` is updated to `b[i] * b[r + j]` for `j = 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`j` is 1, `c` must be at least 1, `i` is within the range 0 <= i < r - 1, `l[i][j]` is `b[i] * b[r + j]` for `j = 1`**
