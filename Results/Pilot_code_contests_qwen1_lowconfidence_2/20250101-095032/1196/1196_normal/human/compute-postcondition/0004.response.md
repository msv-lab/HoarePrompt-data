The variable `flag` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `r` or `c`. The preconditions that `r` and `c` are integers within the range 1 to 500, and that `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the first integer input by the user, `c` is the second integer input by the user, and both are within the range 1 to 500; `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1; `flag` is False**
