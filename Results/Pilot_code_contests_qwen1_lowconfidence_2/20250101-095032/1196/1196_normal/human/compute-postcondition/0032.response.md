Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `c` must be at least 1
   - `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < r - 1\)
   - `l[i][j]` is \((b[i] \times b[r + 1])^2\)

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `c - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `c`.
   - Given that `j` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `c` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `c` must remain at least 1 or greater to allow the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` remains within the range \(0 \leq i < r - 1\).
   - The value of `l[i][j]` will be updated to \((b[i] \times b[r + 1])^2\) with `j` being 2.

5. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `c` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < r - 1\).
   - `l[i][j]` is \((b[i] \times b[r + 1])^2\) with `j` being 2.

State: **`j` is 2, `c` must be at least 1, `i` is within the range \(0 \leq i < r - 1\), `l[i][j]` is \((b[i] \times b[r + 1])^2\) with `j` being 2**
