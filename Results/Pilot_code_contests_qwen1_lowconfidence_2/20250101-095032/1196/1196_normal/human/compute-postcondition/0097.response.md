Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes all iterations.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(r):
    s += str(l[i][j]) + ' '
```

### Variables and Initial States:
- `total` is the original value
- `r` is the original value and must be greater than 0
- `i` is `r`
- `c` is the original value and must be greater than 0
- `flag` is still `True`
- `l` is a 2D list with `r` rows and `c` columns
- `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`
- `j` is 2
- `s` is an empty string

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop runs `r` times.
- During each iteration, the value of `i` ranges from `0` to `r-1`.
- For each iteration, `s` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `l[i][j]` (where `j` is `2`) followed by a space.

### After the Loop Executes All Iterations:
- After the loop completes, `i` will have the value `r`.
- `s` will be the concatenation of the string representations of `l[i][2]` for all `i` from `0` to `r-1`, each followed by a space.

### Final Values:
- `total` remains the original value because the loop does not modify it.
- `r` remains the original value because it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` will be `r` after the loop.
- `c` remains the original value because it is not modified within the loop.
- `flag` remains `True` because the loop does not change its value.
- `l` remains the same 2D list.
- `b` remains the same list containing integers from `1` to `r + c`.
- `j` remains `2` because it is not modified within the loop.
- `s` will be the concatenation of `str(l[i][2]) + ' '` for all `i` from `0` to `r-1`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`total` is the original value, `r` is the original value and must be greater than 0, `i` is `r`, `c` is the original value and must be greater than 0, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a 2D list with `r` rows and `c` columns, `b` is a list containing integers from 1 to `r + c`, `j` is 2, `s` is the concatenation of the string representation of `l[i][2]` for all `i` from 0 to `r-1`, each followed by a space.**
