According to the given for loop, the loop can execute based on the variable `j` and `c`. Specifically, the loop will run as long as `j` is within the range defined by `c`.

Given the initial states:
- `j` is `c-1`
- `c` is `r`
- `s` is ''
- `l` is the original 2D list
- `flag` is `False`
- `s` is not yet printed

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. For the loop to run, `j` must be less than `c` at the start. Given that `j` is initially set to `c-1`, the loop will not execute because `j` equals `c-1`, which means it's already at the upper limit of the range defined by `c`.

To allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust the initial value of `j` to be less than `c`. Since `c` is equal to `r`, we can adjust `j` to be `r-1` or any value less than `r`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`j` is `r-1`, `c` is `r`, `s` is '', `l` is the original 2D list, `flag` is `False`, `s` is not yet printed**
