The code sets `flag` to `True`. This changes the value of `flag` from `False` to `True`. The other variables (`r`, `c`) retain their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`r` is the first integer input by the user, `c` is the second integer input by the user, and both are within the range 1 to 500; `r` is not equal to 1 or `c` is not equal to 1; `flag` is True, and currently, `c` equals 1**
