Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when \( r = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \). According to the problem description, the output for this case should be `0` because there are no diverse matrices of size \( 1 \times 1 \). However, the program incorrectly prints a \( 1 \times 1 \) matrix with the value `1`, which violates the requirement.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: `1 1`

Expected Output: `0`

Actual Output: The program outputs a \( 1 \times 1 \) matrix with the value `1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
