#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 106. The second line contains n distinct positive integers ai such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109.
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the first integer from the input list 'numbers' as read from BytesIO object
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the first integer `n` and the subsequent `n` distinct positive integers from a `BytesIO` object, which contains two lines of input. It then returns the first integer from the input list 'numbers'. The function does not perform any validation on the input values and assumes that the input adheres to the specified constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 106 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). There are no edge cases explicitly handled in the code, and it does not account for scenarios where the input might not conform to these constraints. Additionally, the function does not perform any processing on the input list 'numbers' beyond returning the first element.
