The given code snippet uses `atexit.register` to register a function that writes the contents of `sys.stdout` to standard output (file descriptor 1) when the program exits. However, no changes are made to variables `n` or `ai` within this snippet. The initial state remains unchanged by this code.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 106. The second line contains n distinct positive integers ai such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109; sys.stdout is set to BytesIO(), and `atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))` is executed.**
