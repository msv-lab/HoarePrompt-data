The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from a BytesIO object, which contains two lines of data. The first line is an integer `n` such that `3 ≤ n ≤ 106`, and the second line contains `n` distinct positive integers `ai` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 109`. After processing this input, the function returns the first integer from the input list 'numbers' as read from the BytesIO object.

Functionality: **The function reads input from a BytesIO object containing two lines, the first being an integer `n` and the second being `n` distinct positive integers, and returns the first integer from the input list 'numbers'.**
