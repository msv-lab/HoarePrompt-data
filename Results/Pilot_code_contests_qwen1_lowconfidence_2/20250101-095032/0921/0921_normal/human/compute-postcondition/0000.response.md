The code `sys.stdout = BytesIO()` assigns the `BytesIO` object to `sys.stdout`. This changes the standard output to a bytes buffer, which means any print statements will write to this buffer instead of the console. However, the values of `n` and the list of integers `ai` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 106. The second line contains n distinct positive integers ai such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109; sys.stdout is set to BytesIO()**
