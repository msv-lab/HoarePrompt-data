You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: "A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep". 

Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.

In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets i, j, k such that i < j < k and ai > aj > ak where ax is the power of man standing at position x. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.

Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.

Input

The first line of input contains a single number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains n different positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army. 

Output

A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army. 

Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to calculate the weakness of the Roman army. Specifically, the use of the `order_tree` class and its methods (`query` and `update`) do not align with the problem description. The problem requires counting the number of triplets \(i, j, k\) such that \(i < j < k\) and \(a_i > a_j > a_k\), but the code does not appear to implement this logic accurately.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 5 4 3
```

The expected output is `1`, which corresponds to the triplet \((1, 4, 3)\) since \(1 < 4 < 3\) and \(1 > 4 > 3\). However, the provided code does not correctly handle this case and would likely produce an incorrect result.

To verify this, let's manually check the logic:
- For \(a = [1, 5, 4, 3]\), the sorted array is \([1, 3, 4, 5]\).
- The mapping of indices is \({1: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3}\).
- The code iterates from the end of the array and uses the `query` and `update` methods of the `order_tree` class, which seems to be misused for this purpose.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and thus produces incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
class order_tree:

    def __init__(self, n):
        (self.tree, self.n) = ([[0, 0] for _ in range(n << 1)], n)

    def query(self, r, col):
        res = 0
        l = self.n
        r += self.n
        while l < r:
            if l & 1:
                res += self.tree[l][col]
                l += 1
            if r & 1:
                r -= 1
                res += self.tree[r][col]
            l >>= 1
            r >>= 1
        return res

    def update(self, ix, val, col):
        ix += self.n
        self.tree[ix][col] += val
        while ix > 1:
            self.tree[ix >> 1][col] = self.tree[ix][col] + self.tree[ix ^ 1][col]
            ix >>= 1
input = func_1()
(n, a) = (int(input()), [int(x) for x in input().split()])
(tree, ans) = (order_tree(n), 0)
mem = {i: j for (j, i) in enumerate(sorted(a))}
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    cur = mem[a[i]]
    ans += tree.query(cur, 1)
    tree.update(cur, 1, 0)
    tree.update(cur, tree.query(cur, 0), 1)
print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 106. The second line contains n distinct positive integers ai such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109.
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the first integer from the input list 'numbers' as read from BytesIO object


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
