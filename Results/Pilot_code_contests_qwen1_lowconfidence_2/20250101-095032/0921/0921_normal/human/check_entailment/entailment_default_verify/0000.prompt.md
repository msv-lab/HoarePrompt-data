You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: "A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep". 

Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.

In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets i, j, k such that i < j < k and ai > aj > ak where ax is the power of man standing at position x. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.

Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.

Input

The first line of input contains a single number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains n different positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army. 

Output

A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army. 

Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program seems to use a complex data structure (order_tree) to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of triplets \(i, j, k\) such that \(i < j < k\) and \(a_i > a_j > a_k\).

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Tree Construction**: The `order_tree` class is used to maintain two arrays: one for counting elements less than the current element and another for counting elements greater than the current element.
2. **Query and Update Operations**: The `query` and `update` methods are used to modify and retrieve counts efficiently.
3. **Main Logic**: The program iterates over the array in reverse order, updates the tree, and calculates the answer.

However, the implementation has several issues:
- The logic to calculate the number of valid triplets is incorrect. Specifically, the way the tree is updated and queried does not correctly account for the conditions \(a_i > a_j > a_k\).
- The `mem` dictionary maps each element to its index in the sorted array, which is intended to help with counting. However, the way this is used in the query operation does not align with the requirement to count triplets in the specified order.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
4
10 8 3 1
```
The expected output is `4`, as there are four valid triplets: \((10, 8, 3)\), \((10, 8, 1)\), \((10, 3, 1)\), and \((8, 3, 1)\).

However, running the provided program with this input will produce an incorrect result. For instance, the program might not correctly update the tree to reflect the conditions for forming valid triplets.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads the first integer `n` and the subsequent `n` distinct positive integers from a `BytesIO` object, which contains two lines of input. It then returns the first integer from the input list 'numbers'. The function does not perform any validation on the input values and assumes that the input adheres to the specified constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 106 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). There are no edge cases explicitly handled in the code, and it does not account for scenarios where the input might not conform to these constraints. Additionally, the function does not perform any processing on the input list 'numbers' beyond returning the first element.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
