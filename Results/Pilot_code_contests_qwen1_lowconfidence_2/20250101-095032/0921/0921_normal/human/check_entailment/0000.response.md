Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program seems to use a complex data structure (order_tree) to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of triplets \(i, j, k\) such that \(i < j < k\) and \(a_i > a_j > a_k\).

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Tree Construction**: The `order_tree` class is used to maintain two arrays: one for counting elements less than the current element and another for counting elements greater than the current element.
2. **Query and Update Operations**: The `query` and `update` methods are used to modify and retrieve counts efficiently.
3. **Main Logic**: The program iterates over the array in reverse order, updates the tree, and calculates the answer.

However, the implementation has several issues:
- The logic to calculate the number of valid triplets is incorrect. Specifically, the way the tree is updated and queried does not correctly account for the conditions \(a_i > a_j > a_k\).
- The `mem` dictionary maps each element to its index in the sorted array, which is intended to help with counting. However, the way this is used in the query operation does not align with the requirement to count triplets in the specified order.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
4
10 8 3 1
```
The expected output is `4`, as there are four valid triplets: \((10, 8, 3)\), \((10, 8, 1)\), \((10, 3, 1)\), and \((8, 3, 1)\).

However, running the provided program with this input will produce an incorrect result. For instance, the program might not correctly update the tree to reflect the conditions for forming valid triplets.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
