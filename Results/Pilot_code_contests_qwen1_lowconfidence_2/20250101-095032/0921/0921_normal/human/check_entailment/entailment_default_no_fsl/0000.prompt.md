You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: "A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep". 

Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.

In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets i, j, k such that i < j < k and ai > aj > ak where ax is the power of man standing at position x. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.

Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.

Input

The first line of input contains a single number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains n different positive integers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — powers of men in the Roman army. 

Output

A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army. 

Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).

Program:
```
class order_tree:

    def __init__(self, n):
        (self.tree, self.n) = ([[0, 0] for _ in range(n << 1)], n)

    def query(self, r, col):
        res = 0
        l = self.n
        r += self.n
        while l < r:
            if l & 1:
                res += self.tree[l][col]
                l += 1
            if r & 1:
                r -= 1
                res += self.tree[r][col]
            l >>= 1
            r >>= 1
        return res

    def update(self, ix, val, col):
        ix += self.n
        self.tree[ix][col] += val
        while ix > 1:
            self.tree[ix >> 1][col] = self.tree[ix][col] + self.tree[ix ^ 1][col]
            ix >>= 1
input = func_1()
(n, a) = (int(input()), [int(x) for x in input().split()])
(tree, ans) = (order_tree(n), 0)
mem = {i: j for (j, i) in enumerate(sorted(a))}
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    cur = mem[a[i]]
    ans += tree.query(cur, 1)
    tree.update(cur, 1, 0)
    tree.update(cur, tree.query(cur, 0), 1)
print(ans)

def func_1():
    import os, sys, atexit
    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline


```
Output hints: The function reads the first integer `n` and the subsequent `n` distinct positive integers from a `BytesIO` object, which contains two lines of input. It then returns the first integer from the input list 'numbers'. The function does not perform any validation on the input values and assumes that the input adheres to the specified constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 106 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). There are no edge cases explicitly handled in the code, and it does not account for scenarios where the input might not conform to these constraints. Additionally, the function does not perform any processing on the input list 'numbers' beyond returning the first element.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
