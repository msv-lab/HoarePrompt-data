The code `file.write(sep)` writes the `sep` value (which is a space character) to the `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable**
