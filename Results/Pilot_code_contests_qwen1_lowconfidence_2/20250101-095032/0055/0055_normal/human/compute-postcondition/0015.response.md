`file.write(sep)` writes the `sep` (which is a space character) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This operation does not change the values of the variables but affects the state of `sys.stdout`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element in `args`, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character.**
