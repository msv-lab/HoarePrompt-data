`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of `file`. The value of `file` is `sys.stdout`, so this operation ensures that any buffered data in `sys.stdout` is written to the terminal. However, the content of `sys.stdout` itself does not change immediately because flushing does not add new data but rather ensures existing data is written.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character followed by the string representations of all elements in `args` and a newline character (`\n`), and `sys.stdout` has been flushed.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character followed by the string representations of all elements in `args` and a newline character (`\n`), and `sys.stdout` has been flushed.**
