The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `k`, which is an integer representing the initial number of lines in the file; `n` and `m`, which are positive integers representing the lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of actions respectively; `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each element represents Monocarp's action (0 to add a new line, >0 to change a specific line); and `b`, which is a list of `m` integers where each element represents Polycarp's action (0 to add a new line, >0 to change a specific line).

Based on the actions in lists `a` and `b`, the function processes these actions sequentially and determines the final number of lines in the file after all actions are applied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` and return the final number of lines in the file after applying all specified actions from both Monocarp and Polycarp.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` and returns the final number of lines in the file after applying all specified actions from both Monocarp and Polycarp.**
