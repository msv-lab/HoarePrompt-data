The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `file` variable by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. Since `kwargs` is not explicitly defined, we assume it does not exist or does not contain 'end' key, which means `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` will return `\n`.

The `file` variable is set to `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stdout` currently contains a space character followed by the string representations of all elements in `args`. After executing the code, `sys.stdout` will append a newline character (`\n`) to its current content.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character followed by the string representations of all elements in `args` and a newline character (`\n`).**
