`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. The previous state of `sys.stdout` was a space character. After writing the string representation of `x`, the output on `sys.stdout` will be the space character followed by the value of `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element in `args`, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character followed by the string representation of `x`.**
