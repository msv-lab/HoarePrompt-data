Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character followed by the string representations of all elements in `args` and a newline character (`\n`), and `sys.stdout` has been flushed if the keyword argument `flush` is `True`. If `flush` is not provided or is `False`, the state of `sys.stdout` remains unchanged.***
