Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element in `args`, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character.*** 

Explanation: Since the `if` condition `not at_start` is met (i.e., `at_start` is `False`), the program executes the if part where `sys.stdout` contains a space character. There is no else part, so the postcondition remains as specified by the if part.
