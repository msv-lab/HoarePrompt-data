Postcondition: **`k` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `sys.stdout` now contains a space character followed by the string representations of all elements in `args` and a newline character (`\n`). The current value of `kwargs` has had its 'flush' key popped, and the result of popping is either `False` or was not present in `kwargs`.**
