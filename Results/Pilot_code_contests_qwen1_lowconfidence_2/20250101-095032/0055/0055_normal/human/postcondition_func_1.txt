The function does not accept the parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` as described in the annotations. Instead, it takes positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to `sys.stdout`, separated by a space character (`sep`), and appends a newline character (`end`) at the end. Additionally, it flushes `sys.stdout` if the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`. The function does not modify the parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` and does not return anything.
