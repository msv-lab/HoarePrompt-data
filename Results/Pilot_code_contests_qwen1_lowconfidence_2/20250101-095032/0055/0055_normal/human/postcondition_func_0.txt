The function `func_1` accepts parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers representing actions by Monocarp and Polycarp respectively. However, the function does not contain any code inside the `def` block, meaning it does nothing upon execution. As a result, the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function call. There are no actions performed on these parameters, and no return value is provided. This leads to an incomplete and ineffective function, failing to achieve any intended purpose based on the given annotations.
