Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not attempt to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are empty and do not implement the logic required to generate a correct sequence of actions for Monocarp and Polycarp. Specifically, these functions do not handle the constraints of ensuring that changes to lines only occur after those lines have been added to the file. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
