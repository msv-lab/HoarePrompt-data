Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Actions Sequence Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct a common sequence of actions that includes both Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions. However, the logic for constructing this sequence is flawed. Specifically, the program does not ensure that all actions are correctly ordered and that no changes are made to lines that do not yet exist.

2. **Missing Function Definitions**:
   - The program references functions `func_1` and `func_2` but does not define these functions. This is a logical error because the program assumes that these functions are defined elsewhere and can be called. However, the problem statement indicates that these functions should be defined within the context of the solution.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Adding and Changing Lines**:
   - The program tries to ensure that Monocarp and Polycarp's actions form valid subsequences, but it does not properly handle the constraints of adding and changing lines. For instance, if Monocarp changes a line number that does not exist yet, the program should account for the necessary insertions of new lines.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Example from Problem Description**:
  - Consider the example where \( k = 3 \), \( n = 2 \), \( m = 2 \), \( a = [2, 0] \), and \( b = [0, 5] \).
  - According to the problem, the correct common sequence should be something like `[2, 0, 0, 5]` or `[0, 2, 0, 5]`. However, the current program logic does not guarantee this.
  
- **Invalid Case Detection**:
  - The program does not correctly detect invalid cases where a line change is attempted before the corresponding line is added. For instance, if Monocarp changes line 2 and Polycarp tries to change line 5, the program should handle this by ensuring that the necessary lines are added before the change is made.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description due to the flawed logic for constructing the common sequence of actions and the missing definitions of the required functions. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
