Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic to generate a valid sequence of actions as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are empty and do not contain any implementation to solve the problem. The `func_2` function is meant to print values but does not contribute to solving the problem at hand.

To correctly implement the solution, the program needs to:
1. Initialize the current number of lines in the file based on `k`.
2. Process Monocarp's actions first, ensuring that each action is valid given the current number of lines.
3. Process Polycarp's actions similarly, ensuring that each action is valid given the updated number of lines after Monocarp's actions.
4. Ensure that the combined sequence of actions is a valid interleaving of Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions.

Since the provided code does not contain any logic to achieve this, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is False.
