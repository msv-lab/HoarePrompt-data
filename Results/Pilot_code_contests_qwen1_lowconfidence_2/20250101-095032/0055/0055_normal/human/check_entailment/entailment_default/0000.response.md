Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where both Monocarp and Polycarp try to change the same line simultaneously, which violates the requirement that both actions must be correct and no changes to lines that do not yet exist should occur. For example, consider the following scenario:

- Initial lines: \( k = 3 \)
- Monocarp's actions: \( a = [2, 0] \)
- Polycarp's actions: \( b = [2, 0] \)

In this case, both Monocarp and Polycarp want to change line 2, but line 2 does not exist until Monocarp adds a line before Polycarp can change it. The current implementation does not ensure that Polycarp waits for Monocarp to add a line before changing it. Therefore, the sequence [2, 2] would be invalid.

The code needs to ensure that if both actions are trying to change the same line, the correct order of operations is maintained, ensuring that no changes to non-existent lines occur.
