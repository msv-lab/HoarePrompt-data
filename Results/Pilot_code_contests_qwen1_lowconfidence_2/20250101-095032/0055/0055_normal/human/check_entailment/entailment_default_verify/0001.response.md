Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are empty and do not contain any implementation to generate a valid sequence of actions. The `func_2` function, although it accepts parameters and prints them, does not process or combine Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description and the output hints confirm that the functions do not perform the necessary operations to solve the problem.
