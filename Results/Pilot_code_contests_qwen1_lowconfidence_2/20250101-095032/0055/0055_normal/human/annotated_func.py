#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer representing the initial number of lines in the file, n and m are integers representing the lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of actions respectively, a is a list of n integers representing Monocarp's actions, and b is a list of m integers representing Polycarp's actions. Each element in a and b is either 0 or an integer between 1 and 300, inclusive.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers representing actions by Monocarp and Polycarp respectively. However, the function does not contain any code inside the `def` block, meaning it does nothing upon execution. As a result, the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function call. There are no actions performed on these parameters, and no return value is provided. This leads to an incomplete and ineffective function, failing to achieve any intended purpose based on the given annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer representing the initial number of lines in the file, n and m are positive integers representing the lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of actions respectively. a is a list of n integers where each element represents Monocarp's action (0 to add a new line, >0 to change a specific line), and b is a list of m integers where each element represents Polycarp's action (0 to add a new line, >0 to change a specific line).

If `flush` is not provided or is `False`, the state of `sys.stdout` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept the parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` as described in the annotations. Instead, it takes positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to `sys.stdout`, separated by a space character (`sep`), and appends a newline character (`end`) at the end. Additionally, it flushes `sys.stdout` if the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`. The function does not modify the parameters `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` and does not return anything.
