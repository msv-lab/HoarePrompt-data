The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), and two lists `A` and `B`, where `A` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(0 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\), and `B` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\). The function does not have a return value specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `N` such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), and two lists `A` and `B` where `A` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([0, 10^9]\) and `B` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([1, 10^9]\).**
