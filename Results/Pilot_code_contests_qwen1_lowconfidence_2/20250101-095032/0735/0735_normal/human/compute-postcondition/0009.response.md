Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `a` is `ab[n-1][0]`.
- `b` is `ab[n-1][1]`.
- `cnt` is `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The `for` loop runs in reverse from `n-1` to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to decrease by 1. Therefore, `i` will now be `n - 2`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, we don't need to change `n`, `a`, or `b`. The only state that changes is `i`.

### Updated State
- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
- `i` is now `n - 2`.
- `a` remains as `ab[n-1][0]`.
- `b` remains as `ab[n-1][1]`.
- `cnt` remains unchanged from the previous state.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is `ab[n-1][0]`, `b` is `ab[n-1][1]`**.
