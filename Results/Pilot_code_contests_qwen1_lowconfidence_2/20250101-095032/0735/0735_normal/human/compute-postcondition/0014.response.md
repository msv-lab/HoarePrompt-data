Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `a` is `ab[n-2][0]`.
   - `b` is `ab[n-2][1]`.
   - `cnt` is unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be `-1 + 1 = 0`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be decreased by 1 from `n - 2` to `0`.
   - `a` and `b` will be updated to `ab[0][0]` and `ab[0][1]` respectively.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.

6. **Final State:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` will be 0.
   - `a` will be `ab[0][0]`.
   - `b` will be `ab[0][1]`.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is `ab[0][0]`, `b` is `ab[0][1]`, `cnt` is unchanged**
