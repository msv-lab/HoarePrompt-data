The `continue` statement in this context does not affect the values of `a` and `b`. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are reassigned or otherwise altered by the `continue` statement, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `ab[i][0]`, `b` is equal to `ab[i][1]`**
