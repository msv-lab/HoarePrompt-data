The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet and the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or add new information to the state, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is `ab[n-1][0]`, `b` is `ab[n-1][1]`, and `(a + cnt) % b == 0`**
