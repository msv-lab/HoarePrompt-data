The code `print(cnt)` simply prints the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is already determined by the initial state and does not change because the code does not modify `cnt`. The output of the print statement will be the current value of `cnt`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a` is `ab[0][0]`, `b` is `ab[0][1]`, `cnt` is the sum of `b - (a + cnt) % b` for all valid iterations of the loop.**
