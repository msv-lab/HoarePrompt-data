Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer entered by the user between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `ab` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers.
- `A` is a list of `N` integers where \(0 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\).
- `B` is a list of `N` integers where \(1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\).
- `cnt` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop iterates over a range from `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 (since the range starts at `n - 1` and goes down to `-1`).

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: 
   - The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`.

3. **Other Variables (`ab`, `A`, `B`, `cnt`)**: 
   - These variables do not affect the execution of the for loop directly, but they might be used within the loop body.
   - Therefore, there is no need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `n`, ensuring that it is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`, which will be adjusted automatically by the loop itself.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is initially `n - 1`**
