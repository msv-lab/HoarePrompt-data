`a` and `b` are assigned the values from the tuple `ab[i]`. Since `i` is initially `n - 1`, the values of `a` and `b` will be taken from the last tuple in the list `ab`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is `ab[n-1][0]`, `b` is `ab[n-1][1]`**
