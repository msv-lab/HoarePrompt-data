The code `cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b` updates the value of `cnt` by adding `b - (a + cnt) % b` to it. Let's break this down:

1. The value of `a` is `ab[i][0]`.
2. The value of `b` is `ab[i][1]`.
3. The condition `(a + cnt) % b == 0` determines whether the operation is performed.

If the condition holds true, `cnt` remains unchanged. If the condition does not hold true, `cnt` is updated according to the formula.

The expression `b - (a + cnt) % b` calculates the difference between `b` and the remainder of `(a + cnt)` divided by `b`. This effectively adjusts `cnt` so that `(a + cnt) % b` becomes zero.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is equal to `ab[i][0]`
- `b` is equal to `ab[i][1]`
- If `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

Since the condition does not hold true, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + (b - (a + cnt) % b)`.

Let's denote:
- `a_val` as `ab[i][0]`
- `b_val` as `ab[i][1]`

The updated value of `cnt` is:
\[ \text{new\_cnt} = \text{cnt} + (b - (\text{a} + \text{cnt}) \% \text{b}) \]

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is equal to `ab[i][0]`
- `b` is equal to `ab[i][1]`
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt + (b - (a + cnt) % b)`

Output State: **`a` is equal to `ab[i][0]`; `b` is equal to `ab[i][1]`; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + (b - (a + cnt) % b)`**
