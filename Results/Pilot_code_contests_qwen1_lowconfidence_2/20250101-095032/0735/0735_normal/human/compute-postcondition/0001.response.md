The code snippet `ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]` reads `n` lines of space-separated integers from the standard input and maps each line into a list of integers. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function converts each space-separated string into an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\)
- `n` is an integer entered by the user between 1 and \(10^5\)
- `A` is a list of `N` integers where \(0 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\)
- `B` is a list of `N` integers where \(1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\)

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- `n` remains the same as the value entered by the user.
- `ab` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (converted from strings to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`).

Since the values of `A` and `B` are not altered by this code, they remain as initially defined. The variable `ab` now holds the converted input values, but the original lists `A` and `B` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user between 1 and \(10^5\); `ab` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers; `A` is a list of `N` integers where \(0 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\); `B` is a list of `N` integers where \(1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq N\).**
