Functionality: **The function accepts an integer \(N\) such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), and two lists `A` and `B` where `A` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([0, 10^9]\) and `B` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([1, 10^9]\). It iterates through the list `AB` in reverse order, where each element is a pair \((a, b)\). For each pair, it calculates the difference between `b` and the remainder when `(a + cnt)` is divided by `b`. If this difference is non-zero, it adds this difference to `cnt`. After completing the loop, the function prints the value of `cnt`.

Potential edge cases:
- If \(N = 1\), the loop body will not execute, and `cnt` remains 0.

Missing functionality:
- The current implementation assumes that `AB` is always a valid list of pairs, and each pair contains exactly two integers. There is no error handling for invalid input such as empty lists, non-integer elements, or incorrect pair sizes.**

Final state after the program concludes:
- The variable `cnt` contains the sum of the differences calculated for all valid pairs in the list `AB`. The function prints this value and returns nothing.
