`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. This means `n` will be an integer entered by the user between 1 and \(10^5\). The values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5; n is an integer entered by the user between 1 and \(10^5\); A is a list of N integers where 0 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N; B is a list of N integers where 1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N.**
