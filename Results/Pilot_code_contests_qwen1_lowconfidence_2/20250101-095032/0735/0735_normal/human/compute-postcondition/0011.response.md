The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables directly; it only changes the flow of control within a loop. Given that no loop was specified in the initial state or the code snippet, and considering the impact of `continue`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is `ab[n-2][0]`, `b` is `ab[n-2][1]`**
