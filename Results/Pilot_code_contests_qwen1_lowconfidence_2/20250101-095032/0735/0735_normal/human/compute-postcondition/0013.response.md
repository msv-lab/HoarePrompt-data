`cnt` is incremented by `b - (a + cnt) % b`. Given that `(a + cnt) % b == 0` results in no changes, and there is no else part making any changes when this condition is not met, the condition must be true here, meaning `cnt` does not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is `ab[n-2][0]`, `b` is `ab[n-2][1]`, and `cnt` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is `ab[n-2][0]`, `b` is `ab[n-2][1]`, `cnt` is unchanged**
