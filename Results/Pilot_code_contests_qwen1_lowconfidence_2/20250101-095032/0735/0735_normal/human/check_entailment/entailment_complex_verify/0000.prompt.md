You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are an integer sequence A_1,...,A_N consisting of N terms, and N buttons. When the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) button is pressed, the values of the i terms from the first through the i-th are all incremented by 1.

There is also another integer sequence B_1,...,B_N. Takahashi will push the buttons some number of times so that for every i, A_i will be a multiple of B_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)
* 1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N

Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). Specifically, the program iterates in reverse order, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

Expected Output:
```
7
```

However, the program's output is incorrect. Let's break down the correct solution step-by-step:

1. For \(i = 3\), \(A_3 = 9\) and \(B_3 = 4\). \(9\) is already a multiple of \(4\), so no increment is needed.
2. For \(i = 2\), \(A_2 = 2\) and \(B_2 = 7\). We need to increment \(A_2\) to \(6\) (the smallest multiple of \(7\) greater than or equal to \(2\)), which requires \(4\) increments.
3. For \(i = 1\), \(A_1 = 3\) and \(B_1 = 5\). We need to increment \(A_1\) to \(5\) (the smallest multiple of \(5\) greater than or equal to \(3\)), which requires \(2\) increments.

Thus, the total number of increments required is \(0 + 4 + 2 = 6\).

The provided program calculates the number of increments incorrectly. For instance, it only considers the current value of \(A_i\) without accounting for the cumulative effect of previous increments. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5. Additionally, A is a list of N integers where 0 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and B is a list of N integers where 1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]
        
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a` is `ab[0][0]`, `b` is `ab[0][1]`, `cnt` is the sum of `b - (a + cnt) % b` for all valid iterations of the loop.
    print(cnt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer \(N\) such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), and two lists `A` and `B` where `A` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([0, 10^9]\) and `B` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([1, 10^9]\). It iterates through the list `AB` in reverse order, where each element is a pair \((a, b)\). For each pair, it calculates the difference between `b` and the remainder when `(a + cnt)` is divided by `b`. If this difference is non-zero, it adds this difference to `cnt`. After completing the loop, the function prints the value of `cnt`.

Potential edge cases:
- If \(N = 1\), the loop body will not execute, and `cnt` remains 0.

Missing functionality:
- The current implementation assumes that `AB` is always a valid list of pairs, and each pair contains exactly two integers. There is no error handling for invalid input such as empty lists, non-integer elements, or incorrect pair sizes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
