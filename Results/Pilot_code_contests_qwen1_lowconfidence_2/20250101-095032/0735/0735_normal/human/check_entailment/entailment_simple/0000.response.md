Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires finding the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons so that for every \( i \), \( A_i \) becomes a multiple of \( B_i \). However, the current implementation does not ensure this condition is met for all \( i \).

#### Issues with the Current Implementation:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Incrementing Values**: 
   - The program iterates over the array `ab` in reverse order, but it only increments `cnt` when `(a + cnt) % b != 0`. This means it tries to make `a + cnt` a multiple of `b` for the last element first, and then moves backwards. This logic does not guarantee that all previous elements will satisfy the condition as well.

2. **Lack of Forward Iteration**:
   - The program does not ensure that the condition \( A_i \equiv 0 \pmod{B_i} \) holds for all \( i \) by incrementing `cnt` in a forward manner. It only checks the current value of `a` and `b` without considering the impact on previous values of `A`.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The output of the program is the value of `cnt`, which is intended to be the minimum number of button presses. However, the logic to calculate `cnt` is flawed and does not ensure that all conditions are satisfied.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should use a forward iteration approach to ensure that each \( A_i \) becomes a multiple of \( B_i \). Here's a revised version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    cnt = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = ab[i]
        if (a + cnt) % b != 0:
            cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    
    print(cnt)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
- The program iterates over the list `ab` from the first element to the last.
- For each pair \((a, b)\), it calculates how many additional increments are needed to make \( a + cnt \) a multiple of \( b \).
- It updates `cnt` accordingly to ensure the condition is met for each \( i \).
- Finally, it prints the total number of button presses required.

This approach ensures that the condition \( A_i \equiv 0 \pmod{B_i} \) holds for all \( i \) by processing each element in the correct order.
