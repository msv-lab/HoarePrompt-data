Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). The logic in the program iterates backward through the list of pairs \((A_i, B_i)\) and ensures that for each pair, \(A_i + \text{cnt}\) becomes a multiple of \(B_i\). This is achieved by incrementing \(\text{cnt}\) by the necessary amount to satisfy the condition. Since the program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly and the logic appears sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct for every potential case.
