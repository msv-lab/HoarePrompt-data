You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are an integer sequence A_1,...,A_N consisting of N terms, and N buttons. When the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) button is pressed, the values of the i terms from the first through the i-th are all incremented by 1.

There is also another integer sequence B_1,...,B_N. Takahashi will push the buttons some number of times so that for every i, A_i will be a multiple of B_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)
* 1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1
:
A_N B_N


Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5. Additionally, A is a list of N integers where 0 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and B is a list of N integers where 1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]
        
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a` is `ab[0][0]`, `b` is `ab[0][1]`, `cnt` is the sum of `b - (a + cnt) % b` for all valid iterations of the loop.
    print(cnt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer \(N\) such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\), and two lists `A` and `B` where `A` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([0, 10^9]\) and `B` contains \(N\) integers within the range \([1, 10^9]\). It iterates through the list `AB` in reverse order, where each element is a pair \((a, b)\). For each pair, it calculates the difference between `b` and the remainder when `(a + cnt)` is divided by `b`. If this difference is non-zero, it adds this difference to `cnt`. After completing the loop, the function prints the value of `cnt`.

Potential edge cases:
- If \(N = 1\), the loop body will not execute, and `cnt` remains 0.

Missing functionality:
- The current implementation assumes that `AB` is always a valid list of pairs, and each pair contains exactly two integers. There is no error handling for invalid input such as empty lists, non-integer elements, or incorrect pair sizes.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
