Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the integer \(N\) and then reads \(N\) pairs of integers \((A_i, B_i)\) from the standard input. This correctly matches the problem description which states that the input consists of \(N\) pairs of integers.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. This represents the count of button presses needed.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates through the pairs \((A_i, B_i)\) in reverse order. For each pair:
   - It checks if \((A_i + cnt) \mod B_i\) is zero.
   - If not, it calculates the necessary increment to make \((A_i + cnt)\) a multiple of \(B_i\) and updates `cnt` accordingly.
   
4. **Output**: After processing all pairs, the program prints the final value of `cnt`.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - For \(N = 1\), the loop does not execute, and `cnt` remains 0, which is correct because no button presses are needed.
   - The program does not explicitly handle invalid inputs (like non-integer inputs, empty lists, etc.). However, as per the assumption, valid input is guaranteed.

### Why it follows the problem description:
- The program correctly processes each pair \((A_i, B_i)\) to ensure that \(A_i\) becomes a multiple of \(B_i\) with the minimum number of button presses.
- The logic ensures that the button presses are minimized by calculating the exact increments needed at each step.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum number of button presses, adhering to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
