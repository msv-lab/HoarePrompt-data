Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). Specifically, the program iterates in reverse order, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

Expected Output:
```
7
```

However, the program's output is incorrect. Let's break down the correct solution step-by-step:

1. For \(i = 3\), \(A_3 = 9\) and \(B_3 = 4\). \(9\) is already a multiple of \(4\), so no increment is needed.
2. For \(i = 2\), \(A_2 = 2\) and \(B_2 = 7\). We need to increment \(A_2\) to \(6\) (the smallest multiple of \(7\) greater than or equal to \(2\)), which requires \(4\) increments.
3. For \(i = 1\), \(A_1 = 3\) and \(B_1 = 5\). We need to increment \(A_1\) to \(5\) (the smallest multiple of \(5\) greater than or equal to \(3\)), which requires \(2\) increments.

Thus, the total number of increments required is \(0 + 4 + 2 = 6\).

The provided program calculates the number of increments incorrectly. For instance, it only considers the current value of \(A_i\) without accounting for the cumulative effect of previous increments. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
