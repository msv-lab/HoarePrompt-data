Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to iterate over the list in reverse order and increment `cnt` based on the modulo operation, but it fails to address several key issues:

1. **Incorrect Modulo Operation**: The program checks if `(a + cnt) % b == 0` and continues without incrementing `cnt` if true. This is incorrect because even if `(a + cnt) % b == 0`, `cnt` still needs to be incremented to ensure that `A_i` becomes a multiple of `B_i`.

2. **Reverse Iteration Logic**: The reverse iteration logic does not correctly compute the minimum number of button presses needed. The correct approach should be to start from the first element and move forward, ensuring that each `A_i` becomes a multiple of `B_i` by incrementing the necessary `cnt`.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `N = 1` properly. In such a scenario, the loop body does not execute, and `cnt` remains 0, which is incorrect because the single element should already satisfy the condition if it is a multiple of `B_1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = ab[i]
        while (a + cnt) % b != 0:
            cnt += 1
    
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that each `A_i` becomes a multiple of `B_i` by correctly iterating through the list and incrementing `cnt` until the condition is met.
