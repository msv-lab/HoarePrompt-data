Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when `N = 1`. According to the problem description, when `N = 1`, the loop body will not execute, and `cnt` should remain 0. However, the current implementation initializes `cnt` to 0 and does not modify it if the condition `(a + cnt) % b == 0` is met. This means that even for `N = 1`, `cnt` would still be 0, which is correct. But the main issue is that the code does not handle other potential edge cases or invalid inputs as described. 

To ensure correctness, the code should explicitly check for the single-element case and set `cnt` to 0 only if the condition is not met. Here is an improved version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    
    if n == 1:
        a, b = ab[0]
        if (a) % b != 0:
            print(b - (a) % b)
        else:
            print(0)
        return
    
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b != 0:
            cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)


func()
```

This version explicitly handles the single-element case and ensures that `cnt` is only updated when necessary. However, since the problem statement and constraints indicate that the input is valid and the code does not need to handle invalid inputs directly, the primary issue lies in the assumption that the code works for all cases as described. Therefore, the initial verdict is **False**.
