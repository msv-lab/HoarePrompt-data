The function `func_2(best)` is called with `best` as an argument. However, the code snippet does not show what `func_2` does, and no variables are modified within this snippet. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the call to `func_2`, but its exact impact on the variables is unknown without knowing the definition of `func_2`. The variables `n`, `best`, `curr`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged from their initial values, `func_2(best)` has been called.**
