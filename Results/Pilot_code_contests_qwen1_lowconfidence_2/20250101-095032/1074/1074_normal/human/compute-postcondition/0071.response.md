Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged from their initial values.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is the maximum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - `best` is initialized to 1.
   - `curr` is initialized to `b[1] - a[1] + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`.
     - If `i != n - 1`, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)`. If `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`, then `curr` is set to 1.
     - After each iteration, `curr` is reset to 1 if `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations of the loop, `best` will contain the maximum value obtained by updating `curr` with `c[i]` during each iteration.
   - `curr` will be 1 because the condition `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]` ensures that `curr` resets to 1 at the end of the loop.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial values since no modifications are made to these arrays within the loop.

### Conclusion:
- The final state of the variables after the loop completes all iterations is that `best` contains the maximum value obtained by the loop, `curr` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged from their initial conditions.
