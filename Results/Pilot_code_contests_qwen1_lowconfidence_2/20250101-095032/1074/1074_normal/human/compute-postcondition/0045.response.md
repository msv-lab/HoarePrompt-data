The code swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of their original values. Given that `n` is a positive integer and the values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are swapped accordingly, the values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are updated based on the minimum and maximum of their original values.

Let's denote the original values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` as `a_val` and `b_val` respectively. After the code executes, `a[i+1]` will be the minimum of `a_val` and `b_val`, and `b[i+1]` will be the maximum of `a_val` and `b_val`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `a[i+1]` is the minimum of the original values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `b[i+1]` is the maximum of the original values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.**
