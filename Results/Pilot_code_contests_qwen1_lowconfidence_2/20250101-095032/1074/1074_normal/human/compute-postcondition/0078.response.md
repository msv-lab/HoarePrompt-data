Let's break down the task step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by the variable `i` and `n` in the statement `for i in range(n):`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

2. **Initial Values and Their Impact**: 
   - `best`: This is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop. Its current value is irrelevant for determining if the loop can execute.
   - `curr`: This is set to 1 initially, but it doesn't directly affect the loop condition.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`: These are lists of integers. Their contents are not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `func_2(best)`: This function call doesn't impact the loop's execution condition either.
   - `t`: The state mentions that `t` must be greater than 1, but this is not related to the loop condition `i in range(n)`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**: Based on the loop condition `for i in range(n)`, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
