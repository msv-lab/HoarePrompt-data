According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop.
- `curr` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged from their initial values.
- `func_2(best)` has been called.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `t > 0` must still hold true. Since `curr` is set to 1 at the beginning of each iteration (as per the given information), it doesn't affect the count `t`. The only relevant variable here is `t`, which determines the number of iterations.

If the loop is to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged from their initial values, `func_2(best)` has been called, `t` must be greater than 1**
