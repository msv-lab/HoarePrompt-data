Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is either 2 or `n-1` and it is less than `n`. Before the if statement, `best` is updated to the maximum value between `best` and `curr + c[1]`, and `curr` is `curr + a[2] + (c[1] - b[2] + 1)`. If `a[i + 1]` is equal to the value of `b[i + 1]`, then `curr` becomes `1`. Otherwise, `best` and `curr` retain their values as before the if statement.***
