The code `curr = 1` updates the value of `curr` to 1. The value of `curr` was previously defined as `a[4] + c[3] - b[4] + 2`, but now it is directly set to 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `best`, `a[4]`, `c[3]`, `b[4]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `best` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `1 + c[3]`, `curr` is 1**
