According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than `k + 2`, `i` is `k + 2`, `a[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `b[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`**
