The code initializes a list `c` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `best`, `curr`, `a`, `b`, `func_2(best)`, or the condition that `t` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1, `a` and `b` are unchanged from their initial values, `c` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `func_2(best)` has been called, `t` must be greater than 1**
