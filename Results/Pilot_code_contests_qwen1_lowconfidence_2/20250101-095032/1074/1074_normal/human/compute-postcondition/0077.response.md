The code snippet updates the list `b` by converting each element of the input split by spaces into integers. The original values of `n`, `best`, `curr`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `c` also remains unchanged. The function call `func_2(best)` is made, but the exact effect of this function call is not specified, so we assume it does not directly modify these variables. The only change is in the list `b`.

Let's denote the input as a series of space-separated integers `input_str`. After executing the code:

- `b` will be updated to `[int(bi) for bi in input_str.split()]`, which means `b` will contain the integers from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `c` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `func_2(best)` has been called, `t` must be greater than 1**
