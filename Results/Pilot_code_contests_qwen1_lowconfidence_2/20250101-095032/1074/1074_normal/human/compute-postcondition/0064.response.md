Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[3]`, `curr` retains its value, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain in their initial conditions. If `i` is not equal to `n - 1`, and `a[4] == b[4]`, `curr` remains 1. Otherwise, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`. `best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[3]`.***
