According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed `i` up to some value (let's say it was `i = k`), and the condition for the next iteration would be that `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i = k + 1`. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration is described as follows: the loop swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of their original values. This implies that the next iteration will swap the values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` in the same manner.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:

- `i` should be `k + 1` (or simply `i + 1`).
- The values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` will be updated to the minimum and maximum of their original values.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` is a positive integer, `a[i+1]` is the minimum of the original values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `b[i+1]` is the maximum of the original values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.**
