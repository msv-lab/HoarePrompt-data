The code updates the value of `curr` by adding `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `i + 1` is 4. This means we are updating `curr` with `a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`.

- `a[3]` and `b[3]` remain as the minimum and maximum of their original values after all iterations.
- `best` remains updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[3]`.
- `curr` is updated to `curr + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[3]`, `curr` is `curr + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`**
