Postcondition: ***`i` is 4, `n` is a positive integer, `best` is the maximum of its original value and `curr` + `c`[4], `curr` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` remain in their initial conditions.*** 

Since the else part does not exist or provide additional conditions, the overall postcondition remains consistent with the if part's conditions.
