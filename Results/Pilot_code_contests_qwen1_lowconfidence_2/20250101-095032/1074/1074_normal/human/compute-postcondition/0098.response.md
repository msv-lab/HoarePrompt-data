`curr` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `i` is 3, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[3]`, and `curr` is `curr + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`. After assigning `curr = 1`, the updated value of `curr` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[3]`, `curr` is 1**
