The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: 
- `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases,
- `n`, an integer representing the number of chains,
- `c`, a list of integers where `c[i]` represents the number of vertices in the i-th chain,
- `a`, a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the vertex index in the (i - 1)-th chain that connects to the first vertex of the i-th chain,
- `b`, a list of integers where `b[i]` represents the vertex index in the (i - 1)-th chain that connects to the last vertex of the i-th chain.

Based on the given cases, the function does not have a direct return statement but seems to process the input data. However, since no specific output is mentioned other than the structure of the input, we can infer that the function processes the test cases according to the given structure and possibly returns some form of processed data or result based on the input. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept the specified parameters and process the test cases according to the given structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b`, and processes the test cases according to the given structure.**
