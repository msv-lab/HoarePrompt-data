The code sets `curr` to 1. Since the code does not affect any other variables, the only change is to the value of `curr`.

Output State: **`i` remains 2, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[i]` remains the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` remains the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `best` remains the maximum of 1 and `b[1] - a[1] + 1 + c[i]`, `curr` is 1.**
