`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means the value of `n` is updated to an integer input from the user. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer is now satisfied by the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged from their initial values, `func_2(best)` has been called, `t` must be greater than 1**
