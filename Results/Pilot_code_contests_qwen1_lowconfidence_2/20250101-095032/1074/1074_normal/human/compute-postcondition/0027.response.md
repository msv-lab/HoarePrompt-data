Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `best` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `1 + c[3]`, and `curr` is 1.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition only includes the changes specified in the if part. The if statement checks if `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`. If this condition is true, then `curr` is updated to 1. However, since the precondition already specifies that `curr` is initially `a[4] + c[3] - b[4] + 2`, and the if part sets `curr` to 1, we only need to mention the final value of `curr` as 1 in the postcondition. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `best`) retain their updated values from the precondition and the if part.
