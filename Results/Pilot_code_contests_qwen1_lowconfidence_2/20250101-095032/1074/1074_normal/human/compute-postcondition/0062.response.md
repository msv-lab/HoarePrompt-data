`curr` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `curr` is now `1`, and this affects the subsequent expressions involving `curr`. The values of `n`, `i`, `best`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `curr` is 1, `best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[3]`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain in their initial conditions.**
