Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[3]`, `curr` is 1 if `a[4] == b[4]`, and otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.***
