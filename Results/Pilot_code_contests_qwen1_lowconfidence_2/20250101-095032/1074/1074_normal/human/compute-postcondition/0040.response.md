The code reads a list of integers from the user input and stores them in a new list `a`. This affects the value of `a`, while the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was defined before this line of code. Therefore, `n` is still an integer value of the user's input, and `a` is now a list of integers from the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value of the user's input, `a` is a list of integers from the user's input**
