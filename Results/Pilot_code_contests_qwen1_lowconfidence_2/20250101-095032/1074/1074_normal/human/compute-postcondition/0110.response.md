The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely processes some data derived from external sources or global variables.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(2 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
- `a` and `b` are lists of `n` integers each, where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are valid indices within the range of `c[i-1]` (inclusive).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases doesn't exceed \(10^5\).

Since the function signature only shows `def func_1():`, we can assume that the function accepts `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b` as inputs from outside the function definition. The exact return value is not specified, but typically such functions might return some kind of processed result based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b`, and returns an unspecified value based on the provided inputs.**
