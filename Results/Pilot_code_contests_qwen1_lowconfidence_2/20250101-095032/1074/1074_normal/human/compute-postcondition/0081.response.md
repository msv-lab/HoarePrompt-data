The code updates the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum of the two values, and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of the two values. Given that `i` is now `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, this implies that `i` has been incremented.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `b`, we can only say that the minimum value of the pair will be stored in `a[i]` and the maximum value will be stored in `b[i]`. The preconditions that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now `k + 1` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `k + 1`; `a[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`**
