The code snippet updates the variable `best` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `curr` and `c[i]`. Here are the steps:

1. The initial value of `best` is 1.
2. The initial value of `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`.
3. The new value of `best` will be the maximum of 1 (the original value of `best`) and `curr + c[i]`.

Since `curr` is defined as `b[1] - a[1] + 1`, and there's no specific value given for `c[i]`, the updated value of `best` will be:

- If `curr + c[i] > 1`, then `best` becomes `curr + c[i]`.
- Otherwise, `best` remains 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum of 1 and `b[1] - a[1] + 1 + c[i]`, `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1**
