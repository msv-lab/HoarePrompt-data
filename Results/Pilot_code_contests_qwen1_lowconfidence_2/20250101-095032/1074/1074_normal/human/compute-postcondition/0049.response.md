The variable `best` is assigned the value `1`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `best` is 1.**
