`curr` is reassigned the value 1. This affects the value of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `best` remains the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is 1**
