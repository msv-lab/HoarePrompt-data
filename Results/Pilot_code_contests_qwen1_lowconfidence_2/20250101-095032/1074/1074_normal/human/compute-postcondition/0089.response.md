Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum of 1 and `b[1] - a[1] + 1 + c[i]`, `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`, `i` is not equal to `n - 1`**
