According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` have been swapped such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of the original values.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the range `0` to `n-1`.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last loop execution, and `n` is a positive integer. The values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` have been swapped such that `a[i]` is the minimum and `b[i]` is the maximum of the original values.

2. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, the new value of `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

The updated state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, the values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are swapped such that `a[i+1]` becomes the minimum and `b[i+1]` becomes the maximum of the original values.**
