The code snippet swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum of the two values and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of the two values. However, the provided initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `b`, only that `n` is a positive integer. Since `a` and `b` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. We can only say that for each pair `a[i]` and `b[i]`, the values will be swapped according to the described logic.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of the original values.**
