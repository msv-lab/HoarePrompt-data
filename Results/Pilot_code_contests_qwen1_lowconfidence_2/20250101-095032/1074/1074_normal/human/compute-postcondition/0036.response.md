The function `func_2(best)` is called, which means `best` is passed as an argument to the function `func_2`. However, the code snippet does not modify any variables or return any values. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`best` is the maximum value obtained during the loop, `curr` is 1 if `a[n]` equals `b[n]`, otherwise `curr` is some value determined by the loop logic, and `i` is `n` (the loop has completed).**
