Functionality: **The function takes five parameters: `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b`. It does not process these parameters directly but instead prints the values of these parameters to the standard output stream (`sys.stdout`). The function writes each parameter value followed by a space and continues without a newline until all parameters are printed. After the loop, it appends a newline character to the output. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. If no `sep` or `end` keyword arguments are provided, their default values are a space and a newline, respectively. The function does not return anything. However, it modifies the `sys.stdout` stream by appending the formatted string and flushing the buffer if required.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, or `b` are not provided, the function will still execute but will not have any data to print.
- If the `sep` argument is not provided, it defaults to a space, but the input parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b` are not separated by spaces in the printed output.
- If the `end` argument is not provided, it defaults to a newline, but the function does not append any end character since the parameters are printed without any end character.
- If the `flush` argument is not provided, the output buffer is not flushed.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not modify or process the input parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b` in any way. It simply prints them to the standard output stream.
