Postcondition: ***`i` is 4, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, if `i` is not equal to `n - 1` and `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`, then `curr` is 1, otherwise `curr` remains 2 + `a[5]` + `c[4]` - `b[5]`***
