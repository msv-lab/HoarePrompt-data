To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the final state of the variables based on the provided initial conditions and the loop logic.

### Initial Conditions:
- \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- \(n\) is a positive integer
- \(c\) is a list of \(n\) integers where \(2 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\)
- \(_\) is 0
- \(a[i]\) for each \(i\) in `range(n)` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`
- \(b[i]\) for each \(i\) in `range(n)` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`
- `best` is 1
- `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`

### Loop Logic:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    best = max(best, curr + c[i])
    if i != n - 1:
        curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)
        if a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]:
            curr = 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `best` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`.
   - If `i` is not the last index (`i != n - 1`), `curr` is updated by adding `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)` to `curr`. If `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]`, `curr` is reset to 1.

2. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` (since the loop runs up to `i = n-1`).
   - `best` will hold the maximum value achieved during the loop.
   - `curr` will be updated according to the loop logic, and it will be either the sum of previous values or reset to 1 if `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]`.

3. **Dependence on Original Values**:
   - The values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are determined by the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` (which are the minimum and maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively).

### Final Output State:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final values of the variables will be:
- `best` will be the maximum value obtained during the loop.
- `curr` will be 1 if `a[n]` equals `b[n]` (since `a[n]` and `b[n]` are the original values of `a[n]` and `b[n]` and the loop updates `curr` only when `i < n-1`).

### Output State:
Output State: **`best` is the maximum value obtained during the loop, `curr` is 1 if `a[n]` equals `b[n]`, otherwise `curr` is some value determined by the loop logic, and `i` is `n` (the loop has completed).**
