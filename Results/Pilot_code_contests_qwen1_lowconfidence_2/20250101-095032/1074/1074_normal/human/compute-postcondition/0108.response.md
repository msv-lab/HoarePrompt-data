The function `func_2(best)` is called with the argument `best`. The value of `best` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on `best` within this function call. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition since the function call itself does not modify any variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum value among all updates made during the loop, `curr` is 1 if `a[n] == b[n]`, and otherwise, `curr` is the sum of all increments calculated during the loop.**
