The code snippet provided is:

```python
a = [int(ai) for ai in input().split()]
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. The code takes an input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using `split()`.
2. Each string in the resulting list is converted to an integer using `int()`.
3. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop.
- `curr` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are unchanged from their initial values.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
- `func_2(best)` has been called.
- `t` must be greater than 1.

After executing the code, `a` is updated to the new list of integers obtained from the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is unchanged from its initial value, `c` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `func_2(best)` has been called, `t` must be greater than 1**
