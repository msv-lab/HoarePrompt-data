`best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, the code becomes `best = max(best, curr + c[4])`. The value of `curr` is 1 if `a[4] == b[4]`, and otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. Since no specific value for `c[4]` is given, we'll keep it as `c[4]`.

The output state after the code execution is:
- `i` is 4 (unchanged)
- `n` remains a non-negative integer (unchanged)
- `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations (unchanged)
- `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations (unchanged)
- `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`
- `curr` is 1 if `a[4] == b[4]`, and otherwise `curr` remains unchanged

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[3]` remains the minimum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `b[3]` remains the maximum of the original `a[3]` and `b[3]` after all iterations, `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is 1 if `a[4] == b[4]`, and otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.**
