Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a non-negative integer, `best` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through the loop, `curr` is 1 if `a[n] == b[n]`, otherwise `curr` is the sum of all increments calculated during the loop, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `i` is `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged from their initial values, `func_2(best)` has been called.**
