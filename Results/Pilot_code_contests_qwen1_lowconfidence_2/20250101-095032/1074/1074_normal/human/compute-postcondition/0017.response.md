`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`. This operation does not change the value of `x`, `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, or `file`. It also does not change the fact that `at_start` is `False` and that a string representation of `x` and a space have been written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable (with two elements removed), `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of chains, `c` is a list of integers where `c[i]` represents the number of vertices in the i-th chain, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the vertex index in the (i-1)-th chain that connects to the first vertex of the i-th chain, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` represents the vertex index in the (i-1)-th chain that connects to the last vertex of the i-th chain, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, a string representation of `x` and a space have been written to `sys.stdout`.**
