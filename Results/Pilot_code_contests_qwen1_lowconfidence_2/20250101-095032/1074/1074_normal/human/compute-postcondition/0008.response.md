The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty iterable, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of chains, `c` is a list of integers where `c[i]` represents the number of vertices in the i-th chain, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` represents the vertex index in the (i-1)-th chain that connects to the first vertex of the i-th chain, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` represents the vertex index in the (i-1)-th chain that connects to the last vertex of the i-th chain, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.**
