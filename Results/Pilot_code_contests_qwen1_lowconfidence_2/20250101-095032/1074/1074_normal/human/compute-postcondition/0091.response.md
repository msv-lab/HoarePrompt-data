Postcondition: **`i` remains 2 since the code does not change its value. `n` remains a non-negative integer since the code does not change its value. `a[i]` remains the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations. `b[i]` remains the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations. `best` remains the maximum of 1 and `b[1] - a[1] + 1 + c[i]` since the code does not change its value. `curr` is updated to its current value plus `a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)`. The condition `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]` is true.**
