Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, the elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` are updated such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- Since the loop iterates `n` times, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` will be the final values obtained after all updates.
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged from their original values. However, since the loop is specified to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop is that `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, and `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations.
