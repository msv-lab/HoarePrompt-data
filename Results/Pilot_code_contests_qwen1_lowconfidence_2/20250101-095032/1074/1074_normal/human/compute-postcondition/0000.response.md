Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of chains, c is a list of integers where c[i] represents the number of vertices in the i-th chain, a is a list of integers where a[i] represents the vertex index in the (i - 1)-th chain that connects to the first vertex of the i-th chain, and b is a list of integers where b[i] represents the vertex index in the (i - 1)-th chain that connects to the last vertex of the i-th chain. No changes to the variables were made by the provided code.**

The given code is a docstring comment and does not perform any operations that would affect the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
