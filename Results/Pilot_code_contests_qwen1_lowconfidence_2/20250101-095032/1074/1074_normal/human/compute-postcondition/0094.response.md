Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `a[i]` remains the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` remains the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `best` remains the maximum of 1 and `b[1] - a[1] + 1 + c[i]`, `curr` is updated to its current value plus `a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)` if `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.***
