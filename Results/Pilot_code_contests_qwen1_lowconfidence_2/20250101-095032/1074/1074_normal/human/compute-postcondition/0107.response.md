Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have completed.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is a non-negative integer.
- \( i \) is initially set to \( n \).
- \( a[i] \) is the minimum of the original \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) after all iterations.
- \( b[i] \) is the maximum of the original \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) after all iterations.
- \( best \) is 1.
- \( curr \) is \( b[1] - a[1] + 1 \).

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    best = max(best, curr + c[i])
    if i != n - 1:
        curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)
        if a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]:
            curr = 1
```

### Observations and Analysis

1. **Initialization of \( i \)**: Initially, \( i \) is set to \( n \). The loop runs for \( i \) in the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \). So, after the loop completes, \( i \) will be \( n \).

2. **Values of \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \)**: These values do not change within the loop and retain their final values from the original array after all iterations.

3. **Value of \( best \)**: The value of \( best \) is updated in each iteration based on the expression \( \text{max}(best, curr + c[i]) \). After the loop completes, \( best \) will hold the maximum value among all updates.

4. **Value of \( curr \)**: The value of \( curr \) is updated in each iteration based on the expression \( \text{curr} += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1) \) if \( a[i + 1] \neq b[i + 1] \), and reset to 1 if \( a[i + 1] == b[i + 1] \). After the loop completes, \( curr \) will either be 1 (if \( a[n] == b[n] \)) or the sum of all increments calculated during the loop.

### Final Output State

- \( i \) will be \( n \).
- \( n \) remains a non-negative integer.
- \( a[i] \) retains the minimum value of the original \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) after all iterations.
- \( b[i] \) retains the maximum value of the original \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) after all iterations.
- \( best \) is the maximum value among all updates made during the loop.
- \( curr \) will be 1 if \( a[n] == b[n] \); otherwise, it will be the sum of all increments calculated during the loop.

### Output State
Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `best` is the maximum value among all updates made during the loop, `curr` is 1 if `a[n] == b[n]`, and otherwise, `curr` is the sum of all increments calculated during the loop.**
