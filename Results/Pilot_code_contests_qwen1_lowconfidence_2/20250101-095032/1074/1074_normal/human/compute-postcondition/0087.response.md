To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is initially set to `n`.
- `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations.
- `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations.
- `best` is 1.
- `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will start when `i` is incremented from 1 to `n-1`. The initial value of `i` is `n`, so the loop will not start because `i` is not in the range `[1, n-1]` initially.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range `[1, n-1]` for the loop to start executing.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer but does not need adjustment as it already meets this requirement.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop starts executing, `i` must be adjusted to a value within the range `[1, n-1]`. 

### State Adjustment:
- `i` must be set to 1 or any value in the range `[1, n-1]` for the loop to start.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` after all iterations, `best` is 1, `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`**.
