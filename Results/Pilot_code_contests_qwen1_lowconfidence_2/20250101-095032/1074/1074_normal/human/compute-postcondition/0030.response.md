`best` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`. Given that `curr` is 1 and `i` is 4, the value of `curr + c[i]` is `1 + c[4]`. Since the exact value of `c[4]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `best`. However, we know that `best` will be set to the maximum between its original value and `1 + c[4]`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `curr`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 2, `best` is the maximum of its current value and `1 + c[4]`, `curr` is 1**
