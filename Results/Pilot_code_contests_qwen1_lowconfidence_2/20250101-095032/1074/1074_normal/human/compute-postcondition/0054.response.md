`curr` is incremented by `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)`. The value of `i` is `1` and it is less than `n`, so `i + 1` is `2`. Therefore, `curr` becomes `curr + a[2] + (c[1] - b[2] + 1)`. The value of `best` is updated to the maximum value between `best` and `curr + c[1]`, but since `i` is not `n - 1`, this update does not occur in this step. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2 and it is less than `n`, `best` is updated to the maximum value between `best` and `curr + c[1]` before the current line, and `curr` is `curr + a[2] + (c[1] - b[2] + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2 and it is less than `n`, `best` is updated to the maximum value between `best` and `curr + c[1]` before the current line, and `curr` is `curr + a[2] + (c[1] - b[2] + 1)`**
