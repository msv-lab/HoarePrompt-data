The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for the input, the only change is that the variable `n` is assigned the integer value of the input provided by the user. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the user's input, no other changes.**
