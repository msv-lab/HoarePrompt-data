The code assigns the value `1` to `curr`. The value of `i` is 4, `n` is at least 2, `best` is the maximum of its current value and `1 + c[4]`, and `curr` was previously `a[5] + c[4] - b[5] + 2`. After the assignment, `curr` is now `1`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 2, `best` is the maximum of its current value and `1 + c[4]`, `curr` is 1**
