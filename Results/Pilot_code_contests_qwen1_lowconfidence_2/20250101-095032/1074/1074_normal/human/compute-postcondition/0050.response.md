`curr` is assigned the value `b[1] - a[1] + 1`. The value of `b[1]` is the maximum of the original values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and the value of `a[1]` is the minimum of the original values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Therefore, `curr` will be `b[1] - a[1] + 1`.

The values of `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `best` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `best` is 1; `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`**
