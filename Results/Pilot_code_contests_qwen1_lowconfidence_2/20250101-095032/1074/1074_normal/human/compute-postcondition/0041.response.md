The code snippet takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `b`. The original value of `n` remains unchanged, but now `b` is updated with the new list of integers.

To be more specific, the initial state is that `n` is an integer value of the user's input, and `a` is a list of integers from the user's input. After the code executes, `b` will be a list of integers derived from the user's input, and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value of the user's input, `a` is a list of integers from the user's input, `b` is a list of integers from the user's input split and converted to integers**
