`curr` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `curr` is updated from its previous state, which was `curr + a[2] + (c[1] - b[2] + 1)`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `best`, `a[i + 1]`, `b[i + 1]`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2 and it is less than `n`, `best` is updated to the maximum value between `best` and `curr + c[1]` before the current line, `curr` is `1`, `a[i + 1]` is equal to the value of `b[i + 1]`**
