The code snippet `a[i], b[i] = min(a[i], b[i]), max(a[i], b[i])` updates the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` becomes the minimum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` becomes the maximum of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. 

Given the precondition that `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `n` remains unchanged. The values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are updated according to the logic above.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a[i]` is now the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b[i]` is now the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
