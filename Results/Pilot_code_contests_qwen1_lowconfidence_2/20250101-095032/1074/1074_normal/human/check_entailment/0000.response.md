Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the `a` and `b` values are equal for consecutive chains, which can lead to incorrect cycle lengths.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
3 3 3
-1 1 2
-1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the longest simple cycle should be calculated as follows:
- Chain 1: 3 vertices
- Chain 2: 3 vertices
- Chain 3: 3 vertices

The connections are:
- From the 1st chain to the 2nd chain: 1st vertex of the 2nd chain is connected to the 1st vertex of the 1st chain.
- From the 2nd chain to the 3rd chain: 2nd vertex of the 3rd chain is connected to the 2nd vertex of the 2nd chain.

The longest simple cycle would include all vertices in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd chains, which totals to \(3 + 3 + 3 - 2 = 7\) vertices (since the 1st and 2nd vertices of the 2nd chain are already counted).

However, the program calculates:
- `curr` as `b[1] - a[1] + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1` for the 2nd chain.
- Then `curr` is updated to `1 + (3 - 2 + 1) = 3` for the 3rd chain.
- Finally, the best cycle length is `max(1, 3 + 3) = 6`, which is incorrect.

The correct cycle length should be 7, but the program outputs 6 due to the way it handles the calculation of `curr` when `a[i+1]` equals `b[i+1]`.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this specific case.
