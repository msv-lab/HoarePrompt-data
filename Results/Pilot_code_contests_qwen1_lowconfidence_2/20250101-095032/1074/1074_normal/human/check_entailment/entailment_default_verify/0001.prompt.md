You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have n chains, the i-th chain consists of c_i vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from 1 to c_i along the chain. In other words, the i-th chain is the undirected graph with c_i vertices and (c_i - 1) edges connecting the j-th and the (j + 1)-th vertices for each 1 ≤ j < c_i.

Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: 

  1. the first chain is skipped; 
  2. the 1-st vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the a_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain; 
  3. the last (c_i-th) vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the b_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain.

Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.

A simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of chains you have.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of vertices in the corresponding chains.

The third line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_1 = -1; 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

The fourth line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (b_1 = -1; 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

Both a_1 and b_1 are equal to -1, they aren't used in graph building and given just for index consistency. It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the length of the longest simple cycle.

Example

Note

In the first test case, the longest simple cycle is shown below:

We can't increase it with the first chain, since in such case it won't be simple — the vertex 2 on the second chain will break simplicity.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the chains are connected in a way that creates a simple cycle. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the scenario where the first and last vertices of a chain are connected in a way that forms a longer simple cycle than just the sum of individual chain lengths minus the overlapping vertices.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
3
3 4 3
-1 1 2
-1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the longest simple cycle should be calculated by considering the connections between the chains. However, the provided program calculates the longest simple cycle incorrectly. It simply sums up the lengths of the chains while not properly accounting for the connections.

To illustrate, let's manually calculate the longest simple cycle for the above test case:
- Chain 1 has 3 vertices.
- Chain 2 has 4 vertices.
- Chain 3 has 3 vertices.

The connections are:
- Chain 1 connects to Chain 2 at vertices 1 and 2.
- Chain 2 connects to Chain 3 at vertices 2 and 3.

The longest simple cycle would include the entire first chain, the second chain (excluding the overlap), and the third chain (excluding the overlap). This results in a cycle of length \(3 + (4 - 1) + 3 - 1 = 9\).

However, the program calculates the longest simple cycle as \(3 + 4 + 3 = 10\), which is incorrect because it does not account for the proper overlap when forming the cycle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case, and the output is `False`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes five parameters: `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b`. It does not process these parameters directly but instead prints the values of these parameters to the standard output stream (`sys.stdout`). The function writes each parameter value followed by a space and continues without a newline until all parameters are printed. After the loop, it appends a newline character to the output. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. If no `sep` or `end` keyword arguments are provided, their default values are a space and a newline, respectively. The function does not return anything. However, it modifies the `sys.stdout` stream by appending the formatted string and flushing the buffer if required.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
