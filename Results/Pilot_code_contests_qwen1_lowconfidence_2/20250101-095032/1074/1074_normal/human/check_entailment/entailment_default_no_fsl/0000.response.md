Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. Specifically, the code only considers the intervals defined by consecutive pairs `(a[i], b[i])` and adds the corresponding values from `c`. This approach does not account for the possibility of forming longer cycles by combining multiple intervals. 

For example, consider the following test case:

```
3
4
3 4 3 3
-1 1 2 2
-1 2 2 3
```

The correct output should be 7, as shown in the problem description. However, the given code would incorrectly output a smaller value because it does not properly combine the intervals to form the longest simple cycle.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that it considers all possible ways to form cycles by combining intervals, rather than just adding them up sequentially.
