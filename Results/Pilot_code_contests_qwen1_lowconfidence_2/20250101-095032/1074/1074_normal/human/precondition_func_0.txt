t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, c is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, a and b are lists of n integers each, where a[i] and b[i] are such that a[i] and b[i] are valid indices within the range of c[i-1] (inclusive), and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.
