t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The list c is a list of n integers such that 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. The list a is a list of n integers such that a_1 = -1 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i - 1}. The list b is a list of n integers such that b_1 = -1 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i - 1}. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.
