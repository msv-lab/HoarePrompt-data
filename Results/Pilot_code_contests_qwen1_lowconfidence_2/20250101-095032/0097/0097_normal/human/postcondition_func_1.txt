The function `STR()` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a pair `(p_i, c_i)` in chronological order, where `p_i` and `c_i` are non-negative integers. The function reads input from the user using `input()`, which means it expects the user to provide the pairs `(p_i, c_i)` through standard input. The function simply converts the entire input into a list of strings without any further processing or validation.
