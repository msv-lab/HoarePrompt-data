The function `sortDictWithVal` accepts a dictionary `passedDic` where keys are integers representing timestamps and values are tuples `(p, c)` representing the number of plays and clears at those timestamps. The function first sorts the items of `passedDic` based on the values of the tuples `(p, c)` in ascending order, and if two tuples have the same value, it sorts them based on their keys in ascending order. It then constructs a new dictionary `toret` from the sorted items. The function returns `toret`, which contains all key-value pairs from `passedDic` where the keys are timestamps and the values are tuples `(p, c)` corresponding to those timestamps. The function handles the case where `passedDic` is empty by returning an empty dictionary. No edge cases are explicitly mentioned, but the function correctly handles dictionaries with duplicate values by sorting based on both the value and key.
