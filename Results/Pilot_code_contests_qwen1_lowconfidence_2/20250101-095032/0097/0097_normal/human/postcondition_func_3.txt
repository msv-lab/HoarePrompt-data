The function `MAP()` reads input from the user and returns a map object containing integers. Specifically, it first reads the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers (p_i, c_i) for each test case, where p_i represents the number of plays and c_i represents the number of clears at the i-th moment of time. The function does not perform any calculations or validations on these inputs; it simply parses them into a map object. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input does not follow the expected format, such as non-integer values or negative numbers. If the input is invalid, the function will still attempt to parse it, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors downstream.
