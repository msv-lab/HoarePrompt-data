Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly validate the sequence of plays and clears. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the number of clears increases without an equal or greater increase in the number of plays. Hereâ€™s an example where the program would incorrectly output "YES":

Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
1 1
1 2
```

- At the first peek, `(0, 0)` is recorded.
- At the second peek, `(1, 1)` is recorded, which is valid because the number of plays and clears have both increased by 1.
- At the third peek, `(1, 2)` is recorded, which is invalid because the number of clears increased by 1 while the number of plays did not change. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not properly handle this scenario.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each pair `(p_i, c_i)`, the condition `p_i >= prevplay` and `c_i <= prevplay` must hold true. If the number of clears increases, the number of plays must also increase by at least the same amount.
