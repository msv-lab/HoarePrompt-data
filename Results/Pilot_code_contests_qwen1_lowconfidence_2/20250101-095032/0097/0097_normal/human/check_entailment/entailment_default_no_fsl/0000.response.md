Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the logic required to verify the correctness of Polycarp's records. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the number of plays decreases between two consecutive moments, which is not allowed according to the problem description. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Logic for Handling Decreasing Plays**: The code does not check if the number of plays decreases between two consecutive moments. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   3
   1 0
   0 0
   0 1
   ```
   The code will not detect that the number of plays decreases from 1 to 0 between the first and second moment, which violates the problem constraints.

2. **Implementation Issue**: The current implementation only checks if the number of clears is greater than the previous number of clears and if the difference between the number of plays and clears is non-negative. It does not explicitly handle the case where the number of plays decreases.

To fix this, you would need to add a check to ensure that the number of plays does not decrease between two consecutive moments. Here is an updated version of the code with the necessary check:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    from collections import defaultdict

    INF = float('inf')
    mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
    t = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    while t != '0':
        n = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        data = [sys.stdin.readline().strip().split() for _ in range(int(n))]
        prevplay = 0
        prevClr = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(int(n)):
            p, c = map(int, data[i])
            if p < prevplay or c < prevClr or p < c:
                flag = 1
                break
            if c > prevClr:
                if c - prevClr > p - prevplay:
                    flag = 1
                    break
            prevplay = p
            prevClr = c
        if flag:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        t = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
```

This updated code includes the necessary check to ensure that the number of plays does not decrease between two consecutive moments. If this check fails, the program will print 'NO', indicating that the records are not correct.
