Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_1` does not correctly verify the correctness of the records according to the problem description. Specifically, the code checks if the number of clears (`c_i`) is greater than the previous number of clears (`prevClr`) and ensures that the difference in clears is less than or equal to the difference in plays. However, this logic does not fully capture the constraints described in the problem. 

To correctly verify the records, the code needs to ensure the following additional conditions:
1. For each pair \((p_i, c_i)\), the number of plays `p_i` should be greater than or equal to the previous number of plays `prevplay`.
2. For each pair \((p_i, c_i)\), the number of clears `c_i` should be greater than or equal to the previous number of clears `prevClr`.
3. The number of clears `c_i` should be greater than or equal to the number of plays `p_i`.

The provided code only checks the first condition and part of the second condition but does not enforce the third condition. For example, consider the following test case:

```
3
1 0
2 1
3 1
```

The code will incorrectly output "YES" for this test case because the number of clears is not greater than or equal to the number of plays at the last step. The correct output should be "NO".

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  1 0
  2 1
  3 1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
