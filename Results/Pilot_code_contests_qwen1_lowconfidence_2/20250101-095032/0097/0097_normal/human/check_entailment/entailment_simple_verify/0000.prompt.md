You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.

All levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by 1. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by 1 as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).

Polycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.

So he peeked at the stats n times and wrote down n pairs of integers — (p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), ..., (p_n, c_n), where p_i is the number of plays at the i-th moment of time and c_i is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).

Between two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.

Finally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.

Help him to check the correctness of his records.

For your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 500) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers p_i and c_i (0 ≤ p_i, c_i ≤ 1000) — the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the i-th moment of time.

Note that the stats are given in chronological order.

Output

For each test case print a single line.

If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print "YES".

Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


6
3
0 0
1 1
1 2
2
1 0
1000 3
4
10 1
15 2
10 2
15 2
1
765 432
2
4 4
4 3
5
0 0
1 0
1 0
1 0
1 0


Output


NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.

The second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.

In the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.

The fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.

In the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.

Nobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly validate the sequence of plays and clears. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the number of clears increases without an equal or greater increase in the number of plays. Here’s an example where the program would incorrectly output "YES":

Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
1 1
1 2
```

- At the first peek, `(0, 0)` is recorded.
- At the second peek, `(1, 1)` is recorded, which is valid because the number of plays and clears have both increased by 1.
- At the third peek, `(1, 2)` is recorded, which is invalid because the number of clears increased by 1 while the number of plays did not change. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not properly handle this scenario.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each pair `(p_i, c_i)`, the condition `p_i >= prevplay` and `c_i <= prevplay` must hold true. If the number of clears increases, the number of plays must also increase by at least the same amount.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
