You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.

All levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by 1. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by 1 as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).

Polycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.

So he peeked at the stats n times and wrote down n pairs of integers — (p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), ..., (p_n, c_n), where p_i is the number of plays at the i-th moment of time and c_i is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).

Between two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.

Finally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.

Help him to check the correctness of his records.

For your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 500) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers p_i and c_i (0 ≤ p_i, c_i ≤ 1000) — the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the i-th moment of time.

Note that the stats are given in chronological order.

Output

For each test case print a single line.

If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print "YES".

Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


6
3
0 0
1 1
1 2
2
1 0
1000 3
4
10 1
15 2
10 2
15 2
1
765 432
2
4 4
4 3
5
0 0
1 0
1 0
1 0
1 0


Output


NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.

The second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.

In the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.

The fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.

In the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.

Nobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that violate the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Decreasing Values**: The program does not properly handle cases where the number of clears (`c_i`) decreases between two consecutive moments. According to the problem description, the number of clears can only increase or stay the same, never decrease. The program does not check for this condition.

2. **Incomplete Logic for Checking Validity**: The logic for checking if the sequence of plays and clears is valid is incomplete. Specifically, it does not handle the scenario where the number of plays (`p_i`) can be less than the previous number of plays (`prevplay`), which is not allowed according to the problem description.

Here is an example that the program fails to handle correctly:

```
3
10 10
15 12
10 11
```

In this example:
- At the first moment, `p = 10` and `c = 10`.
- At the second moment, `p = 15` and `c = 12`, which is valid.
- At the third moment, `p = 10` and `c = 11`, which is invalid because the number of plays decreased.

The program should identify this as an invalid sequence, but it does not due to its incomplete logic.

To fix these issues, the program needs to explicitly check for decreasing values of `p` and `c` and ensure that `p` is always greater than or equal to the previous `p`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 10 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `zero` and reads a bytes object `s` from standard input. It processes the bytes object `s` character by character to accumulate integers into a list `A`. During processing, it handles the sign of the number (positive or negative) and ensures that each integer is appended to the list `A`. After the loop, it checks if the last character of `s` is a digit; if so, it appends `zero` to `A`. Finally, it returns the list `A`. Potential edge cases include reading non-digit characters and ensuring that the loop correctly handles the termination condition. The function assumes that the code is running in Python 3, where `py2` is set to `False`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
