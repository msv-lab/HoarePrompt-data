The function `sortListWithIndex` takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers representing the number of plays and clears at a certain moment, and an integer `idx` specifying the index (0 or 1) to sort the list of tuples. It returns a new list that is sorted based on the `idx`-th element of each tuple. If `idx` is 0, the list will be sorted based on the number of plays; if `idx` is 1, the list will be sorted based on the number of clears. The original `listOfTuples` remains unchanged. Edge cases include when `idx` is neither 0 nor 1, in which case the function will still return a sorted list based on the first element of each tuple due to the default behavior of the `sorted` function.
