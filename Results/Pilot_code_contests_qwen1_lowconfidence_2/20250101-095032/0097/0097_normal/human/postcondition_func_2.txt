The function `INT()` reads an integer input from the user and ensures that the input is within the range of 1 to 500. If the input is outside this range, the function will repeatedly prompt the user until a valid integer within the specified range is provided. The function accepts no parameters and returns a single integer value that is guaranteed to be between 1 and 500 inclusive.
