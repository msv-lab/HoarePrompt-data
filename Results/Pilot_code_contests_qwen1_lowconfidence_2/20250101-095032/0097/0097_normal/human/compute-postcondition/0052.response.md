Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3, `INF` is float('inf'), `pairs` (p_i, c_i) are unchanged, `mod` is 1000000007, `t` must be greater than 0, `zz` is a list of `n` elements, each element is a LIST(), `prevplay` is `zz[2][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[2][1]`, `temp` is `zz[3][1] - zz[2][1]`, `i` is 3, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[0][0]`, `flag` remains 1. If `zz[3][1] > zz[2][1]`, then either `flag` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out if `temp > temp1`, or the state of the program remains unchanged if `temp <= temp1`.***
