Postcondition: **`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is a list containing the accumulated integers based on the input string `s`, `numb` is `zero`, `sign` is `1`, and `i` is the index of the next character in `s` to be processed. The last character of `s` is greater than or equal to the byte value of `'0'`.**
