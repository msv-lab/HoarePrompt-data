Postcondition: **`flag` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, the current value of `i` satisfies `(zz[i][0] < prevplay or zz[i][1] < prevClr or zz[i][0] < zz[i][1])` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `temp` is `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[i][0]`, and if the current value of `temp` is greater than the current value of `temp1`, then `temp` remains unchanged, otherwise `temp1` remains unchanged.**
