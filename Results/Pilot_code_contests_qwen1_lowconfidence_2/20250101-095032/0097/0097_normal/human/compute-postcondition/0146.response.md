Postcondition: ***`flag` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, the current value of `i` satisfies `(zz[i][0] < prevplay or zz[i][1] < prevClr or zz[i][0] < zz[i][1])` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `temp` and `temp1` are either `zz[i][1] - prevClr` and `zz[i][0]` respectively, or `temp1` and `temp` remain unchanged depending on whether `temp` is greater than `temp1`.***
