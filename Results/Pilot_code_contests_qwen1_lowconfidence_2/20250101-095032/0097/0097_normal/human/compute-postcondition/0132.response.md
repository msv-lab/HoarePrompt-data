The line `prevClr = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `prevClr`. The value of `prevplay` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it in this line. All other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, `zz`) remain in their original states since they were not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0**
