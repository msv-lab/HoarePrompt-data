`t` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `INF` is float('inf'); `pairs` (p_i, c_i) are unchanged; `mod` is 1000000007; `t` is `t - 1`; `zz` is a list of `n` elements, each element is a LIST(); `prevplay` is the last value of `zz[i][0]` in the loop; `prevClr` is the last value of `zz[i][1]` in the loop; `flag` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition being met; `i` is `n`; if `flag` is 1, the program prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'.**
