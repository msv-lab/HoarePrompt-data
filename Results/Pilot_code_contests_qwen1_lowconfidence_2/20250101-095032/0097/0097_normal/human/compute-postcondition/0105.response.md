Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[2][1]`, and if `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were in the precondition.***
