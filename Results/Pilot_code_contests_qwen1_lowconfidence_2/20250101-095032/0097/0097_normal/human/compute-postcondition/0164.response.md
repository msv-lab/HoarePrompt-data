Postcondition: ***`flag` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[i+1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[i+1][1]`, and the condition `(zz[i+2][0] < prevplay or zz[i+2][1] < prevClr or zz[i+2][0] < zz[i+2][1])` still holds, and either `zz[i][0] < prevplay or zz[i][1] < prevClr or zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]` is true, or this condition does not hold (no changes to `flag`, `t`, `n`, `zz`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`).***
