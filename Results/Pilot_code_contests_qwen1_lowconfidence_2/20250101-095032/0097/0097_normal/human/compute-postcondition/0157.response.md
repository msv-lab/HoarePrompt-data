Postcondition: ***`flag` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[i+1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[i+1][1]`, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[i][0] - prevplay`, and if `temp > temp1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `temp <= temp1`, the condition does not change the variables' states as there is no else part provided.***
