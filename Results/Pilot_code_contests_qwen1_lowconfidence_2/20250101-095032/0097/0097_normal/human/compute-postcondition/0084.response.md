The code sets `flag` to 1. This means the value of `flag` is now 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `temp`, `temp1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `flag` is 1, `temp` is a positive value equal to `zz[0][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[0][0] - prevplay`**
