Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is `[zero]`, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is `1`, `i` is `0`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to `b'\r'[0], then `A` remains as `[zero]`. Since there is no else part, the state of the program does not change regardless of the condition.***
