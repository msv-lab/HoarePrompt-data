Postcondition: ***`flag` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[i+1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[i+1][1]`, and the condition `(zz[i+1][0] < prevplay or zz[i+1][1] < prevClr or zz[i+1][0] < zz[i+1][1])` still holds. Additionally, if `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]`, then `flag` is broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
