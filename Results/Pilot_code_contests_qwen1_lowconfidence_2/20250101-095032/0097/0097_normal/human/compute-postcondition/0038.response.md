Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is a list. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `A` contains `[1 * numb, 1 * numb]`, `numb` is calculated based on the value of `i` and the content of `s`, and `sign` is `-1`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `A` is updated to contain `[zero, zero]`, `numb` is set to `zero`, and `sign` is set to `1`.***
