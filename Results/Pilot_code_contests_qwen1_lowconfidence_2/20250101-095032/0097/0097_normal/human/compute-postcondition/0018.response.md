Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is `[zero]`, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is `1`, `i` is `0`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is set to `-1` and `i` is incremented to `1`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not `b'-'[0]`, then the state of the program remains unchanged.***
