The code `zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list (denoted by `LIST()`) to the list `zz`. Initially, `zz` contains `[[]]`.

After executing the code, `zz` will now contain two elements: the original `[]` and the newly appended `[]`. Therefore, the updated state of `zz` is `[[], []]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `zz` is `[[], []]`**
