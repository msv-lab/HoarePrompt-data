The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on some predefined or external data that includes a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of pairs \((p_i, c_i)\) where \(0 \leq p_i, c_i \leq 1000\). The pairs are given in chronological order.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature, we need to infer the parameters from the problem statement. The function likely processes these pairs based on the given constraints.

Since the function signature does not include parameters, we can only describe what it does based on the constraints and relationships provided:

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) and a list of pairs \((p_i, c_i)\) (where \(0 \leq p_i, c_i \leq 1000\)), and returns a value based on these inputs.**
