The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only causes the loop or statement to exit. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same after the `break` statement is executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[2][1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
