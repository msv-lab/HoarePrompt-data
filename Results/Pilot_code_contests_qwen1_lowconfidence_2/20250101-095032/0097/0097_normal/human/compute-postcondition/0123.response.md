The code `zz = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `zz`. This does not affect the values of `flag`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `flag` being equal to 1, `t` being greater than 0, `n` being an integer from input, and `zz` being an empty list.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `zz` is an empty list**
