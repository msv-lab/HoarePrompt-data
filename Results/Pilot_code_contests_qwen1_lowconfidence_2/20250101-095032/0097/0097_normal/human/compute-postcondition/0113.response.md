`prevClr` is updated to the value of `zz[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `prevClr` is now `zz[2][1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[2][1]`, and `temp1` remains unchanged.**
