Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is a list containing one element which is `1 * numb`, `numb` is equal to `-47` or updates based on the first character of `s`, `sign` is `-1` or changes to `1`, and `i` is `1` or `2`. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0], numb updates accordingly and sign becomes `-1`. Otherwise, `numb` updates based on the first character of `s` and sign remains `-1`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0], `A` contains `1 * numb` and `numb` equals `zero`, while `sign` remains `1`.***
