Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `flag` is either 0 or 1. If `zz[i][1]` is greater than `prevClr`, then `flag` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0. No changes are made to `n` and `i` in the else part since there is no else part provided.***
