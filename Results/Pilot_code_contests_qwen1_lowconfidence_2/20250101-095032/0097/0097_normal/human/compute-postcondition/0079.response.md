Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If `zz[i][0]` is less than `prevplay` or `zz[i][1]` is less than `prevClr` or `zz[i][0]` is less than `zz[i][1]`, then `flag` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. No changes are made to `n` and `i` in the else part since there is no else part provided.***
