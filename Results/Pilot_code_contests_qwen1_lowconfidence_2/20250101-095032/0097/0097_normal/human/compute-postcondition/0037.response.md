Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is a list containing two elements `[zero, zero]`, `numb` is `zero`, `sign` is `1`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, `A` is updated to contain `[zero, zero]`, `numb` remains `zero`, and `sign` remains `1`. Since there is no else part, these changes apply regardless of the condition.***
