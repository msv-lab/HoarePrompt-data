Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[0][1]`. The condition ensures that if `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]` is true, `flag` will be set to 1. There is no else part, so the values of other variables remain unchanged.***
