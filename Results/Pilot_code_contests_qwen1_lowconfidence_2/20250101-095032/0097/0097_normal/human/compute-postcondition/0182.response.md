Functionality: **The function processes a series of pairs \((p_i, c_i)\) for a given positive integer \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)). It checks if the pairs meet certain conditions. Specifically, it verifies that for each pair \((p_i, c_i)\):

1. \(p_i \geq prevplay\) and \(c_i \geq prevClr\).
2. If \(c_i > prevClr\), then \(c_i - prevClr \leq p_i - prevplay\).

If any of these conditions fail for any pair, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all pairs, the function ends.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(n = 0\), the function will not enter the main loop and will simply decrement `t`, which is initially set by `INT()`. Since `t` is decremented at the end of each iteration and `t` starts as a positive integer, this scenario would only occur if `INT()` returns 0, which is not within the allowed range for `t`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is 0. In such a scenario, the function should check if `t` is greater than 0 before proceeding into the loop to ensure that there are valid test cases to process. However, since the code only decrements `t` without checking its value, it implies that `n` must be positive and `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, this edge case is implicitly handled by the loop condition.
