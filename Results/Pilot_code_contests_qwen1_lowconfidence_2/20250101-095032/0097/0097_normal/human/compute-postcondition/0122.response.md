`n` is assigned the value `INT()`, where `INT()` likely represents an input converted to an integer. However, since the input value is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. The only thing we know is that `t` must be greater than 0, and `flag` is equal to 1. 

Output State: **`flag` is equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input**
