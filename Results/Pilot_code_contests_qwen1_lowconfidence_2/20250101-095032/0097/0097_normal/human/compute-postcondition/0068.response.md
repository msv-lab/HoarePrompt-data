`zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list to the list `zz`. Since `zz` was initially an empty list, after appending an empty list, `zz` now contains one empty list. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `zz` contains `[[]]`**
