According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n-1`. Since `zz` is mentioned to contain an empty list, it does not affect the loop condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain at least 1. However, since `i` is `n-1`, `i` will increase by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to `n`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must still be at least 1, and `i` will become `n` (which is still at least 1).

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `zz` contains an empty list**
