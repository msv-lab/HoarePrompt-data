Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is a list containing one element which is `1 * numb`, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is `1`, and `i` is `1` or `2`. This is true if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'\r'[0]`, the condition does not change any of these variables' states.***
