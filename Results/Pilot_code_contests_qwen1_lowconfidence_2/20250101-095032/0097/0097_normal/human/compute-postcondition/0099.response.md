Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[0][1]`. If `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[0][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[i][0] - zz[0][0]`, and if `temp > temp1`, the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement is broken. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
