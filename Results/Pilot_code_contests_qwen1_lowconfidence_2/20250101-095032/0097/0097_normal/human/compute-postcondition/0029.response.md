Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer, `s` is a bytes object containing the input data read from standard input, `py2` is `False`, `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input, `A` is a list containing one element which is `1 * numb`, `numb` is equal to `-518 + conv(s[1])` if `i` is 1 and `i-1` is less than the length of `s`, `-518 + conv(s[2])` if `i` is 2 and `i-1` is less than the length of `s`, `-47` if `s[i]` is `b'-'[0]` and `i-1` is out of bounds, or updates based on the first character of `s` otherwise, `sign` is `-1` if `s[i]` is `b'-'[0]` and `i-1` is within bounds, otherwise it is `1`, and `i` is `1` or `2`.***
