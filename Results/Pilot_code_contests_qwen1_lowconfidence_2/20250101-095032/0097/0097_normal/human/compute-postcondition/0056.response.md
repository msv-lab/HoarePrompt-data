Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0; `INF` is float('inf'); `pairs` (p_i, c_i) are unchanged; `mod` is 1000000007; `t` must be greater than 0; `zz` is a list of `n` elements, each element is a LIST(); `prevplay` is the last value of `zz[i][0]` in the loop; `prevClr` is the last value of `zz[i][1]` in the loop; `flag` is 1 since the if condition is met, otherwise `flag` is 0; `i` is `n`.**
