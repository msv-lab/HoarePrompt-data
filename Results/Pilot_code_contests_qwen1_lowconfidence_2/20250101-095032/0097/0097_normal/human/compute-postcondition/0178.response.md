Postcondition: ***`flag` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is the last value of `zz[i][0]`, `prevClr` is the last value of `zz[i][1]`, and the loop has executed `n` times without breaking out of the loop due to any of the conditions specified. If `flag` is 1, the function continues without any additional changes. If `flag` is not 1, the console prints 'YES'.***
