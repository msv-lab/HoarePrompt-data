The code assigns the value of `zz[i][0] - prevplay` to `temp1`. Here, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[0][0]`. So, `temp1` will be calculated as `zz[i][0] - zz[0][0]`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `flag`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[0][1]`, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[0][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[i][0] - zz[0][0]`**
