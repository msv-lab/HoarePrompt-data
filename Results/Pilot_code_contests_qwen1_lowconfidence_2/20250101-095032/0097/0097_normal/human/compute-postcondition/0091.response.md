`flag` is assigned the value 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[0][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[0][1]`**
