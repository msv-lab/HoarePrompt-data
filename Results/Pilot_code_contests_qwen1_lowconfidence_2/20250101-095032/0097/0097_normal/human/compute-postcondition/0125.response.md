`zz` is appended with the value `LIST()`. Since `LIST()` is a function call, it returns an empty list, and this empty list is appended to `zz`. The initial value of `zz` is an empty list, so after appending, `zz` becomes `[[]]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is `[[]]`**
