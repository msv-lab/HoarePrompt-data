According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `zz` contains `[[]]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 1, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`, and `zz` remains as `[[]]`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `zz` contains `[[]]`**
