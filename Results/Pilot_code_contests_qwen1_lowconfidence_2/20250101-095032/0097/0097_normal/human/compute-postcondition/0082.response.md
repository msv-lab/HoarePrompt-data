`temp1` is assigned the value `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. Given that `i` is 0, this can be rewritten as `temp1 = zz[0][0] - prevplay`. The value of `zz[0][0]` is not specified in the initial state, and `prevplay` is also not defined. However, we know the initial values of `n`, `i`, `flag`, and `temp`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `flag` is 0, `temp` is a positive value equal to `zz[0][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[0][0] - prevplay`**
