`prevClr` is assigned the value of `zz[i][1]`. The previous value of `prevClr` was `zz[0][1]`. The value of `i` remains 1, and the value of `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `flag` and `prevplay` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[i][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[i][1]`.**
