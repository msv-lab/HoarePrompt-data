The code `zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list to `zz`. Since `zz` was initially `[[], []]`, appending another empty list will change its value to `[[], [], []]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is equal to 1; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `zz` is [[], [], []]**
