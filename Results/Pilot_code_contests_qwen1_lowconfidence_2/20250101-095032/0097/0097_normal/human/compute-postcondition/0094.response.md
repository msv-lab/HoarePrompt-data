The code `temp = zz[i][1] - prevClr` assigns the value of `zz[i][1] - prevClr` to the variable `temp`. Since `prevClr` is equal to `zz[0][1]`, we can substitute this value into the expression. Therefore, `temp` is calculated as `zz[i][1] - zz[0][1]`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[0][1]`, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - zz[0][1]`.**
