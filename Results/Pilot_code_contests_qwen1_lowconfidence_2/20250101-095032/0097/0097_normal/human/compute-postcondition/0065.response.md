Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop is iterating `n` times using the `range(n)` function. This means that the loop will run exactly `n` times, where `n` is the integer input from the user.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is the integer input from the user.
   - `INF` is defined as `float('inf')`.
   - `pairs` (p_i, c_i) are unchanged.
   - `mod` is set to `1000000007`.
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `zz` is an empty list.
   - `prevplay` is the last value of `zz[i][0]` in the loop.
   - `prevClr` is the last value of `zz[i][1]` in the loop.
   - `flag` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition being met.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs `n` times, and if `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute at all.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `n`, but during the loop, `i` will decrement in each iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, `i` should start from `n-1` and decrease to 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n`, we need to adjust it to start from `n-1` and then decrement.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Based on these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` should start from `n-1`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`**
