passedDic is a dictionary where keys are integers representing timestamps (or any monotonically increasing values) and values are tuples (p, c) where p is an integer representing the number of plays and c is an integer representing the number of clears at the corresponding timestamp. The dictionary is not necessarily sorted, but the input pairs (p, c) for each timestamp are valid (i.e., 0 ≤ p, c ≤ 1000) and the timestamps are unique.
