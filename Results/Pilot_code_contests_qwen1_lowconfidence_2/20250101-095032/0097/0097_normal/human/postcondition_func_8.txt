The function `sortDictWithKey` takes a dictionary `passedDic` as input, where the keys are non-negative integers representing moments of time and the values are tuples `(p, c)` indicating the number of plays `p` and clears `c` at those moments. The function returns a new dictionary where the items are sorted in ascending order by their keys. This means the keys (moments of time) in the returned dictionary are in increasing order, and the values remain tuples `(p, c)` representing the number of plays and clears at those moments. No changes are made to the original dictionary; a new sorted dictionary is created and returned.
