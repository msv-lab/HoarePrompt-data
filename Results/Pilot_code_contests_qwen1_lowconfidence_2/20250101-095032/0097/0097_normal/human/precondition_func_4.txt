T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each line contains two integers p_i and c_i such that 0 ≤ p_i, c_i ≤ 1000, representing the number of plays and the number of clears at the i-th moment of time, respectively, and the pairs are given in chronological order.
