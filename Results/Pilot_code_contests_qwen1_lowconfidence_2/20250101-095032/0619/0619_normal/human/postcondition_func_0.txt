The function takes an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It converts each integer in the array to a 32-bit binary string, reverses the binary string, and pads it with leading zeros if necessary. The function then iterates through the binary strings to construct a final binary string `ans`. If all bits in any position are the same, it sets the corresponding bit in `ans` accordingly. Otherwise, it determines the maximum value by flipping the bit in `ans` and considering the maximum XOR value with the original integers. Finally, it prints either the maximum XOR value when `ans` is all ones or the minimum of two possible maximum XOR values based on the constructed `ans`.
