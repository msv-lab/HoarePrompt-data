Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If the character at position `[i][j]` in the string `s` is '0', `mx0` is updated to the maximum of `mx0` and the integer value of the binary number represented by the substring of `s[i][:j][::-1]`. If the character at position `[i][j]` in the string `s` is not '0', `mx1` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the integer representation of the reversed substring from `i` to `j` in the string `s`.
