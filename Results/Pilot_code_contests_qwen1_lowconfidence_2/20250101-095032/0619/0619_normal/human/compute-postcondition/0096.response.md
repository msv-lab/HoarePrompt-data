`c0` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is 30, and the value of `s[i][j]` is '0', so `c0` will increase by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either "1" or "0", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, the current value of `j` is 30, `c0` is 1, `c1` is 0, and the current value of `s[i][j]` is '0'.**
