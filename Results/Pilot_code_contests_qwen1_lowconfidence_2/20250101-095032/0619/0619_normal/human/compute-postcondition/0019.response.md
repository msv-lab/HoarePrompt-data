Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `len(ts) < 32`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i`, which is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.
   - `ts` is the string `'00'`.

3. **Check the Current Value of `ts`:**
   - `ts` is currently `'00'`, which has a length of 2.

4. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `len(ts)` must be less than 32.
   - Since `len(ts) = 2` and `2 < 32`, the loop can indeed execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `ts`. It must be such that `len(ts)` is still less than 32 after the next iteration.
   - After the next iteration, `len(ts)` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body increases `len(ts)` by 1).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `ts` must be a string whose length is 3 (so that after the next iteration, it becomes 4, which is still less than 32).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i`, which is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`; `ts` is a string of length 3**
