Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list containing the integer `i` followed by the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.
   - `i` is the first element of `a` and is an integer with fewer than 32 bits.
   - `ts` is a string of 32 zeros.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `a` currently contains `[i, '00000000000000000000000000000000']`.
   - `i` is the first element of `a` (an integer).
   - `ts` is still a string of 32 zeros.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - In the previous iteration, the loop processed the first element `i` of the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list and it has exactly two elements, the loop will execute once for each element.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - After processing the first element `i`, the loop will now process the second element `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.
   - At this point, `i` will no longer be the first element of `a` because the loop has already processed it. The second element will become the first element in the next iteration.

6. **Updated State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` will now be `[ '00000000000000000000000000000000', <next value of i> ]` if the loop continues, but since `a` only had two elements initially, it won't change.
   - `i` will now be the second element of `a`, which is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.
   - `ts` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i`, `i` is the second element of `a` and is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`, `ts` is a string of 32 zeros**
