Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either an empty string plus '1' or an empty string plus '0', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, `j` is 32, `c0` is 0, `c1` is equal to `n` in the if part and not equal to `n` in the else part, and `mx0` and `mx1` are the maximum values of '0's and '1's counts over all positions from 0 to 31.**
