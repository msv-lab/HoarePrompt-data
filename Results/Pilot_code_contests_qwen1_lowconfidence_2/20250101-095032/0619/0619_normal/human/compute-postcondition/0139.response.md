Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either "11", "10", or "00", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's from position 31 to 0 in the binary strings, `c1` is the count of '1's from position 31 to 0 in the binary strings. If `c1` is equal to `n`, then `ans` is "11". Otherwise, if `c0` is equal to `n`, then `ans` is either "10" or "00". In both cases, `i` is `n`, `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '0', `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '1', `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`, and `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`.***
