The code `ts = ts[::-1]` reverses the string `ts`. The initial state is that `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `ts` is the binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix. After executing the code, `ts` will be reversed.

Let's denote the initial binary representation of `i` as `ts_initial`. After reversing `ts_initial`, we get `ts_reversed`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, `i` is the first element of `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i` (i.e., `ts_reversed`).**
