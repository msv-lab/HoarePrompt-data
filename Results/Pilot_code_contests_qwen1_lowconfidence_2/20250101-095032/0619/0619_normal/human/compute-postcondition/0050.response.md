Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 31, `c0` is either 1 or 0, `c1` is either 1 or 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0. If `s[i][j]` is '0', then `c0` is incremented by 1. If `s[i][j]` is not '0', then `c1` is incremented by 1 and `i` is set to 1.***
