The code assigns `-1` to the variable `ansr`. This is the only change made to the variables. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, where each integer is converted to a 32-bit binary string (reversed and padded with leading zeros if necessary); `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, each corresponding to the integers in `a`; `ans` is an empty string; `brk` is -1; `leftp` is 0; `ansl` is -1; `ansr` is -1**
