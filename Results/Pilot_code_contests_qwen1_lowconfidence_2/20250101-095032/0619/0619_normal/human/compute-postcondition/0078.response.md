`mx0` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (`0`) and the integer value of the substring `s[i][:j][::-1]`. The substring `s[i][:j][::-1]` represents the binary string from index `0` to `j-1` in `s[i]`, reversed.

Given the initial state:
- `s[1][j]` is either '0' or '1'.
- If `s[1][j]` is '0', then `mx1` is `0`.
- If `s[1][j]` is '1', then `mx1` is `2^j - 1`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `s[1][j]` is '0':
   - `mx1` is `0`.
   - `mx0` is updated to `max(0, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))`.
   - Since `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` is the integer value of the reversed substring, and the maximum value of `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` is less than or equal to \(2^{j-1} - 1\), `mx0` remains `0`.

2. If `s[1][j]` is '1':
   - `mx1` is `2^j - 1`.
   - `mx0` is updated to `max(0, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))`.
   - Since `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` is the integer value of the reversed substring, and the maximum value of `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` is less than or equal to \(2^{j-1} - 1\), `mx0` remains `0`.

In both cases, `mx0` does not change from its initial value of `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is '1', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 1, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is 1, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, and `mx1` is either 0 (if `s[1][j]` is '0') or \(2^j - 1\) (if `s[1][j]` is '1').**
