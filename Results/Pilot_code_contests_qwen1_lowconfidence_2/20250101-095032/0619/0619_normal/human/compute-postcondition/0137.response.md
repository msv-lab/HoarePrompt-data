The code `break` does not affect any variables' values and simply breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional block. Since there is no such block in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '0', `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '1', `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`**
