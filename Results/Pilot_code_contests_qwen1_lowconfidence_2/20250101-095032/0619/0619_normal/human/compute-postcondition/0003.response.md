Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop structure**: The loop is structured as `for i in a:`. This means that `i` takes each element from the list `a` one by one.

2. **Understand the requirements for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty list because the `for` loop iterates over the elements of the list.
   - Since `a` is a list of `n` integers (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), the list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to start executing.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - We know that `a` is a list of `n` integers, and since `n` is at least 1, `a` must contain at least one integer.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

- `a` must be a non-empty list containing at least one integer.
- `i` will be set to the first element of `a` at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, and `i` is the first element of `a`**.
