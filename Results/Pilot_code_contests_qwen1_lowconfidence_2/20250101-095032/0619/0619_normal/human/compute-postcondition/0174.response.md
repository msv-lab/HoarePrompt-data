Postcondition: ***`total` is not mentioned, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is the integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` or 0, `mx1` is 0, `leftp` is 3 << `j`. If `s[i][j]` is '0', `c0` is incremented by 1. If `s[i][j]` is '1', `c0` remains unchanged.***
