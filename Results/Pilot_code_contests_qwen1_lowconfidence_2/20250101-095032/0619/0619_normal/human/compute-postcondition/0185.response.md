The code snippet assigns the value of `leftp + mx1` to `ansr`. This means that `ansr` is updated based on the values of `leftp` and `mx1`. The values of `c0`, `c1`, `n`, `mx0`, and `mx1` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State will reflect these unchanged variables along with the new value of `ansr`.

Output State: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is the maximum integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `i` where `s[i][j] == '0'`, `mx1` is the maximum integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `i` where `s[i][j] != '0'`, `leftp` is `2^j * 3`, `ansl` is `2^j * 3 + mx0`, `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`**
