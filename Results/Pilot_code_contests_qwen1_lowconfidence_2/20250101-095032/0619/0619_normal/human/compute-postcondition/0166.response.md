`ans` is assigned the value of itself plus `'1'`. This means that `ans` now includes an additional '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `ans` is `ans` plus '1'.

Output State: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `ans` is `ans` plus '1'**
