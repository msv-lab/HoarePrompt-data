The code `ts += '0'` appends the character '0' to the end of the string `ts`. Since `ts` is initially a string of length 5, appending a single character will make it a string of length 6.

- The value of `a` remains unchanged: `a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i`, where `i` is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.
- The value of `ts` changes: `ts` is now a string of length 6, which is the original string plus the appended '0'.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i`, where `i` is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`; `ts` is a string of length 6.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i`, where `i` is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`; `ts` is a string of length 6**.
