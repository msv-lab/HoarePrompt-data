`c1` is incremented by 1, so `c1` becomes `c1 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`c0` is 1 or `c1` is 1 (now `c1` is `c1 + 1`), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `n`, and the character at position `s[i][j]` is '0' if `c0` is incremented, otherwise it is not '0'**
