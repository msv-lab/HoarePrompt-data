The code snippet provided updates the value of `mx1`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `s` or `j`, which are required to determine the exact value of `mx1`. Since `mx1` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the result of converting a substring of `s[i][:j]` to an integer after reversing it and interpreting it in base 2, without knowing `s` and `j`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `mx1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mx1` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring of `s[1][:j]` interpreted in base 2.**
