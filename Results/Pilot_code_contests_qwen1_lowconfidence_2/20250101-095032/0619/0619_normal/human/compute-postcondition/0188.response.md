Postcondition: ***`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and the loop has executed for all elements in the list `s`; `ans` is a string that either is set to `c1` (which is `n`) concatenated with one additional `'1'` if `c1` equals `n`, or is determined based on the maximum integer values `mx0` and `mx1`, where `mx0` is the maximum integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `i` where `s[i][j] == '0'`, and `mx1` is the maximum integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `i` where `s[i][j] != '0'`, with `ans` being `'0'` if `c0` equals `n`, otherwise `ans` is set to the appropriate value based on the comparison of `mx0` and `mx1`, `leftp` is `2^j * 3`, `ansl` is `2^j * 3 + mx0`, and `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`.***
