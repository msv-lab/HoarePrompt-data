The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and this constraint is maintained by the `int(raw_input())` operation (it ensures that only integer inputs within this range are accepted), the value of `n` remains within this range. All other variables remain in their initial state because no operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5**
