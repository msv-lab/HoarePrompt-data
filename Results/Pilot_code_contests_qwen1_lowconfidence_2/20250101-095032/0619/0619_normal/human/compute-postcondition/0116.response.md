`mx1` is assigned the value 0. This resets `mx1` to 0, but does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings; `ans` is either "1" or "0"; `brk` is -1; `leftp` is either 0 or 1; `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`; `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`; `j` is 0; `c1` is less than `n`; `c0` is the count of '0's from position 31 to 0 in the binary strings; `mx0` is 0; `mx1` is 0; `c0` is not equal to `n`.**
