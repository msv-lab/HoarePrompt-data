`ts` is a string that contains the reversed binary representation of `i`. The code appends `'0'` to the end of `ts`. Therefore, the new value of `ts` is the original value of `ts` plus `'0'`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, `i` is the first element of `a` and is an integer with fewer than 32 bits, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i` followed by '0'.**
