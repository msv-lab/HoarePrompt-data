Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is a binary string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either the integer value of `ans` (if `ansl` == -1) or \(2^{32} - 1\) (otherwise), `ansl` is either -1 (if `ansl` == -1) or the maximum of all `ansl ^ i` where `i` is an integer in `a` (otherwise), `ansr` is either \(2^{32} - 1\) (if `ansl` == -1) or the maximum of all `ansr ^ i` where `i` is an integer in `a` (otherwise), `j` is -1, `c0` is `n`, `c1` is `n`, `i` is `n`, and either `a1` is the maximum value of `leftp ^ i` for each `i` in `a` (if `ansl` == -1) or the minimum of `m1` and `m0` (where `m0` is the maximum of all `ansl ^ i` and `m1` is the maximum of all `ansr ^ i` for each `i` in `a`) is printed.**
