To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer.
   - `i` is the first element of `a`.
   - `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while len(ts) < 32:`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as the length of `ts` is less than 32.

3. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i`.
   - The length of `ts` is determined by the number of bits in the binary representation of `i`.

4. **Determining the Adjustment:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `ts` must be less than 32.
   - Since `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i`, we need to ensure that the length of the binary representation of `i` is such that after reversing it, the length is still less than 32.

5. **Key Consideration:**
   - If the binary representation of `i` has fewer than 32 bits, reversing it will not change the length, and the loop will continue.
   - If the binary representation of `i` has 32 or more bits, reversing it will result in a string of length 32 or more, causing the loop to terminate.

6. **Adjustment Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that the binary representation of `i` has fewer than 32 bits to keep the loop running.
   - Therefore, `i` should be an integer whose binary representation has fewer than 32 bits.

### Conclusion:
The state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `i` is an integer with a binary representation of fewer than 32 bits.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, `i` is the first element of `a` and is an integer with fewer than 32 bits, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of `i`**
