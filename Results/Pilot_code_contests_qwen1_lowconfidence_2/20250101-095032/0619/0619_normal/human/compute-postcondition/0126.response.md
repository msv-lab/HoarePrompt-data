Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body (Omitted for this analysis):**
   - If the character at position `[i][j]` in the string `s` is '0', `mx0` is updated to the maximum of `mx0` and the integer value of the binary number represented by the substring of `s[i][:j][::-1]`.
   - If the character at position `[i][j]` in the string `s` is not '0', `mx1` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the integer representation of the reversed substring from `i` to `j` in the string `s`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being 0 and `n` being greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1).
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` increases by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0.** 

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
