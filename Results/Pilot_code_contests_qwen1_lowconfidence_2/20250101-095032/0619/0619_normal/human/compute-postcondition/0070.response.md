The code `leftp <<= j` shifts the bits of `leftp` to the left by `j` positions. Given the initial state, `leftp` is 1 and `j` is 0. Shifting 1 to the left by 0 positions does not change its value.

Therefore, the value of `leftp` remains 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is '1', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 1, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**.
