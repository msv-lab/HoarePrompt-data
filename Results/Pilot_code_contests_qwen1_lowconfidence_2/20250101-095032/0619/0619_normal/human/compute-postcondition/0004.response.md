The code `ts = bin(i)[2:]` converts the integer `i` (which is the first element of the list `a`) to its binary representation and slices off the '0b' prefix. The variable `ts` will store this binary string without the '0b' prefix.

Given that `i` is the first element of the non-empty list `a`, let's denote the first element of `a` as `i`. The binary representation of `i` will be stored in `ts`, and `ts` will not have the '0b' prefix.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, and `i` is the first element of `a`; `ts` is the binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix.**
