Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `c0`: Count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`.
   - `c1`: Count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`.
   - `i`: Initially set to `n`.
   - `n`: Greater than 0.
   - `c1` is not equal to `n`.
   - `c0` is not equal to `n`.
   - `mx0`: 0.
   - `mx1`: 0.
   - `leftp`: 3 << `j`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition (`i` and `n`).

- Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the only way for the loop to execute is if `i` (which is `n`) is less than `n`. This condition cannot hold true because `i` cannot be less than itself. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to a value less than `n` for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `i` is less than `n`. This means `i` should be initialized to a value less than `n`.

Given these points, let's summarize the required adjustments:

State: **`total` is not mentioned, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `leftp` is 3 << `j`**
