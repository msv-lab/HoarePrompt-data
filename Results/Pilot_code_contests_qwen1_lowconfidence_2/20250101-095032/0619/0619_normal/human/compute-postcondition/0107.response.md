Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either "1" or "0", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, `i` is 4, `j` is 30, `c0` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `c1` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `s[i][j] == '0'`, then `c0` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `c0` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `c1` is either 1 or 2.***
