`ans` is assigned a string `'0'` and added to the existing value of `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, it could be an empty string or any other string. However, since no initial value for `ans` is given, we assume it starts as an empty string for this calculation.

The value of `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, and the current value of `c0` is equal to `n`.

After executing the line `ans += '0'`, `ans` will be updated by appending `'0'` to its current value. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, it now becomes `'0'`.

Output State: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, the current value of `c0` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is `'0'`.**
