Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either "1" or "0", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's from position 31 to 0 in the binary strings, `c1` is the count of '1's from position 31 to 0 in the binary strings, and `c1` is equal to `n`**
