The code appends the character `'0'` to the string `ts`. The initial state of `ts` is a string of length 3. After appending `'0'` to `ts`, the length of `ts` becomes 4.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i`, which is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`; `ts` is a string of length 4**
