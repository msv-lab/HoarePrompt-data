`ansr` is assigned the value of `leftp + mx1`. The values of `i`, `mx0`, `mx1`, and `ansl` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '0', `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '1', `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`**
