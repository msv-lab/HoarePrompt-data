Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is '1', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 1, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is 2, `c0` is not equal to `n`. If `s[i][j] == '0'`, then `mx0` is updated to be the maximum of `mx0` and the integer value of `s[2][:0][::-1]` (which is 0). Otherwise, `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of `mx1` and the integer value of `s[2][:0][::-1]` (which is 0).***
