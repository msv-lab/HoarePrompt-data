The code `ts = ts[::-1]` reverses the string `ts`. Since `ts` is initially `'0'`, reversing it does not change its value.

The other variables `a` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'` followed by the integer `i` which is the string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`; `ts` is the string `'0'`.**
