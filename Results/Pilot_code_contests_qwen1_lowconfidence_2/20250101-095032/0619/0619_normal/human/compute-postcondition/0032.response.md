According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ts`. The loop continues as long as `len(ts)` is less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `ts` is a string of length 32.

For the loop to execute one more time, `len(ts)` must be less than 32. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ts` to ensure its length is less than 32.

State: **`a` is an empty list; `i` is '00000000000000000000000000000000'; `ts` is a string of length less than 32**
