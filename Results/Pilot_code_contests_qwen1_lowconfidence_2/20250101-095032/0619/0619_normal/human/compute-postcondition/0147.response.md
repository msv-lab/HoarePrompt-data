`c1` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `n`, and the character at position `s[i][j]` is not '0'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`c1` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `n`, and the character at position `s[i][j]` is not '0'**
