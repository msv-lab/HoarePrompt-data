The code `leftp <<= j` shifts the bits of `leftp` to the left by `j` positions. Since `leftp` is initially 3 (binary: `0011`), shifting it left by `j` positions will depend on the value of `j`. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `leftp` based on the shift operation, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `leftp` is 3 << `j`**
