Postcondition: ***`c0` is 2 or `c1` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `n`, and the character at position `s[i][j]` is '0' if `c0` is incremented, otherwise it is not '0'.***

Explanation: 
- If the condition `s[i][j] == '0'` is true, `c0` is incremented to 2.
- If the condition `s[i][j] == '0'` is false, `c1` is incremented to 2 (since it was initially 1 and now becomes 2).

In both cases, `i` remains 2, `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is still less than `n`. The character at position `s[i][j]` is '0' if `c0` is incremented, otherwise it is not '0'.
