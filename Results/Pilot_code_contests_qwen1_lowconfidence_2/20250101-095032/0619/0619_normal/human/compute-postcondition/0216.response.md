The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it seems the problem description is about the input constraints and expected output rather than the function signature. Given the constraints and relationships:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- The second line contains `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30} - 1\).

The output is not specified in the function definition but implied by the context. Based on the provided information, the function likely processes these integers and returns some form of result (though not explicitly stated).

Given this, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and returns a result based on the input values.**
