The code `a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts each integer into a list. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). After executing the code, the variable `a` is updated to hold a list of integers which are the converted values from the input.

Since the exact input is not provided, we know that `a` will be a list of integers derived from the input, but we cannot specify the exact contents of `a` without knowing the input. However, we can say that `a` will have `n` elements, where `n` is the number of integers in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input**
