`ansl` is assigned the value of `leftp + mx0`. From the initial state, we know `leftp` is 1 and `mx0` is the maximum value of `mx0` over all positions `j` from 0 to 31. However, since no specific value for `mx0` is given, we will keep it as `mx0`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is '1', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 1, `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 32, `c0` is 0, `mx0` is the maximum value of `mx0` over all positions `j` from 0 to 31, `mx1` is the maximum value of `mx1` over all positions `j` from 0 to 31.**
