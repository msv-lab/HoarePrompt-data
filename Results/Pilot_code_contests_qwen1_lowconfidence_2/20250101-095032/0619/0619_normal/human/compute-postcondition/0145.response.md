The code `c0 += 1` increments the value of `c0` by 1. Since `c0` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is initialized to 0 before this line of code is executed. After the increment, `c0` will be 1.

The conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `n`.

The state of `s[i][j]` also remains unchanged: it is still '0'.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`c0` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be less than `n`, the current value of `s[i][j]` is '0'.**
