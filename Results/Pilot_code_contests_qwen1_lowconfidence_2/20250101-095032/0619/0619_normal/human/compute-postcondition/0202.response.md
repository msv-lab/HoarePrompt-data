`m1` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is a binary string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is \(2^{32} - 1\), `ansl` is \(2^{32} - 1\), `ansr` is \(2^{32} - 1\), `j` is -1, `c0` is `n`, `c1` is `n`, `i` is `n`, and `m1` is `0`.
