Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either "1" or "0", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, `j` is 31, `c0` is either 0, 1, or 2, `c1` is either 0 or 1. Depending on the value of `s[i][j]`, if `s[i][j]` is '0', `c0` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `c1` is incremented by 1.***
