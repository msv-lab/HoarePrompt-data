Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s` is equal to `n`***
