Postcondition: ***`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is either incremented by 1 or remains as `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reverse substring of `s[i][:j]` (base 2) if `s[i][j] == '0'`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the binary string `s[i][:j][::-1]` if `s[i][j] != '0'`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `leftp` is `3 << j`***
