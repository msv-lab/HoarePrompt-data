The code snippet `mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))` updates the value of `mx1`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `s` and `j`, which are required to determine the exact value of `mx1`. Since these values are missing, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `mx1`. The only thing we know is that `mx1` is now the maximum between its current value and the integer value of the reversed binary substring of `s[i][:j]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `mx1` is the maximum between its current value and the integer value of the reversed binary substring of `s[2][:j]`**
