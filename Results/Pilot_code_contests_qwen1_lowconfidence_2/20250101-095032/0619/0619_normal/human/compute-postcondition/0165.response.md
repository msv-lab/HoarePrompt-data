The code `mx1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mx1`. The values of `c0`, `c1`, `i`, `n`, `mx0` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**
