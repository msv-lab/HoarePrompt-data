`c1` is incremented by 1. The value of `c1` was initially 0, so now `c1` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 31, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[i][j]` is not '0'**
