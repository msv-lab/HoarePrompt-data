`c1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c1` was either 0 or 1, so now it is either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either "1" or "0", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, `i` is 4, `j` is 30, `c0` is either 0, 1, or 2, `c1` is either 1 or 2.**
