Postcondition: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is the maximum integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `i` where `s[i][j] == '0'`, `mx1` is the maximum integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` for each `i` where `s[i][j] != '0'`, `leftp` is `2^j * 3`, `ansl` is `2^j * 3 + mx0`, `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`, and `ans` is either `'0'` if `c0` equals `n` or determined based on `mx0` and `mx1` as described in the else part if `c0` does not equal `n`.**
