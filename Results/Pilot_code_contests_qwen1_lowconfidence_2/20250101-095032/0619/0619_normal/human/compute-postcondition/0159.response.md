The code snippet `ans += '1'` increments the string `ans` by appending the character `'1'` to it. The initial value of `c1` is `n`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and the loop has executed for all elements in the list `s`; `ans` is a string that originally had the value of `c1` (which is `n`) concatenated with one additional `'1'`.**
