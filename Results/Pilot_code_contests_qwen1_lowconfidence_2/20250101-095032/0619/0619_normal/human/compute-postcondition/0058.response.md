Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 31, `c0` is either 2 or 1, `c1` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. If `s[i][j]` is '0', then `c0` becomes 3 if it was initially 2 or 2 if it was initially 1. Otherwise, `c1` becomes either 2 or 3.**
