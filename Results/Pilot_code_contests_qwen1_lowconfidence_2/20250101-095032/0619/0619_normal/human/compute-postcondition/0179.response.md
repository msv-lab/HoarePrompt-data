Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`.
   - `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`.
   - `i` is less than `n` (now `i + 1`).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `c1` is not equal to `n`.
   - `c0` is not equal to `n`.
   - `mx0` and `mx1` are updated based on the conditions mentioned.
   - `leftp` is `3 << j`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Key Points:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - The values of `c0`, `c1`, `mx0`, `mx1`, and `leftp` will be updated inside the loop.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i + 1 < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `c0` and `c1` will remain the same unless the loop body updates them.
   - `mx0` and `mx1` will be updated based on the condition inside the loop, but we don't know their exact values without seeing the loop body.
   - `leftp` remains `3 << j` as it is not updated in the loop.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `c0` and `c1` will stay the same unless the loop body changes them.
   - `mx0` and `mx1` will be updated according to the loop body.
   - `leftp` will still be `3 << j`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is less than `n` (now `i + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` and `mx1` are updated based on the loop body, `leftp` is `3 << j`**.
