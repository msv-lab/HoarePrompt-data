`c0` is incremented by 1. Since `c0` was initially 1 or `c1` is 1, after incrementing `c0` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition regarding the character at position `s[i][j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c0` is 2, `c1` is 1 (or `c0` is 1), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `n`, and the character at position `s[i][j]` is '0' if `c0` is incremented, otherwise it is not '0'.

Output State: **`c0` is 2, `c1` is 1 (or `c0` is 1), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is less than `n`, and the character at position `s[i][j]` is '0' if `c0` is incremented, otherwise it is not '0'.**
