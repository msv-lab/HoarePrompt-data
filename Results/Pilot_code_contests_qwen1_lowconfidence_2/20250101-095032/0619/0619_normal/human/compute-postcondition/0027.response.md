The code `ts = ts[::-1]` reverses the string `ts`. The original value of `ts` is `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`. Reversing this string results in `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.

The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is '00000000000000000000000000000000', `ts` is '00000000000000000000000000000000'**
