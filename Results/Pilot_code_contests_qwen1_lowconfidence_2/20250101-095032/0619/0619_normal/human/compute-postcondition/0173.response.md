The code `mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))` impacts the variable `mx1`. It calculates the binary value of the substring of `s[i]` from the start to `j-1` (excluding `j`), reverses it, and then converts it to an integer. This integer is then compared with the current value of `mx1`, and `mx1` is updated to the maximum of these two values.

Given that `s[i][j]` is '1', the substring `s[i][:j]` consists only of '0's up to position `j-1`. Reversing this substring does not change its value because it contains only '0's. Therefore, `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` evaluates to 0, since the binary representation "0" is 0 in decimal.

Since `mx1` is initially 0 and the new value (0) is not greater than the current `mx1`, `mx1` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **`total` is not mentioned, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `leftp` is 3 << `j`, `s[i][j]` is '1'**
