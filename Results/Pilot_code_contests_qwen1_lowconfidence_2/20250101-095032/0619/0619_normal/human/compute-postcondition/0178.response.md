Postcondition: ***`total` is not mentioned, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the list `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the list `s`, `i` is less than `n` (now `i + 1`), `n` is greater than 0, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` and `mx1` are updated as follows: `mx0` is the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]` if `s[i][j] == '0'`; otherwise, `mx1` is the integer value of the binary number represented by `s[i][:j][::-1]`, `leftp` is 3 << `j`.***
