`c0` is incremented by 1. The value of `c0` was initially `0`, so now it is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions and their validity are also preserved.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 31, `c0` is 1, `c1` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[i][j]` is '0'**
