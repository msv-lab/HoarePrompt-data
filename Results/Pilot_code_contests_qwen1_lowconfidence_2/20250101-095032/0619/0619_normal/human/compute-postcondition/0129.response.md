Postcondition: ***`i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If `s[i][j]` is '0', then `mx0` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `int(s[1][:j][::-1], 2)`. If `s[i][j]` is not '0', then `mx1` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring of `s[1][:j]` interpreted in base 2.***
