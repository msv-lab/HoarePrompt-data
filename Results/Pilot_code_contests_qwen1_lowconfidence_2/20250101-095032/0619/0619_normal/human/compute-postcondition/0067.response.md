The code `mx1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to `mx1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, and `mx1` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**.
