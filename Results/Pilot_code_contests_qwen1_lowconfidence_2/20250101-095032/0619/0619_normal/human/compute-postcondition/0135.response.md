`ansl` is assigned the value of `leftp + mx0`. The value of `leftp` and `mx0` are taken from the initial state, while `mx1` and `i` retain their values from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '0', `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer representation of the binary strings starting with '1', `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`.**
