The code `ans += '0'` appends the character '0' to the string stored in the variable `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` is either "1" or "0", appending '0' will change it to "10" if it was initially "1", or to "00" if it was initially "0". 

All other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of `n` 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is either "10" or "00", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is either 0 or 1, `ansl` is either -1 or `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is either -1 or `1 + mx1`, `j` is 0, `c1` is less than `n`, `c0` is the count of '0's from position 31 to 0 in the binary strings, `mx0` is the maximum count of consecutive '0's in the binary strings, `mx1` is the maximum count of consecutive '1's in the binary strings, and `c0` is equal to `n`.**
