The code snippet updates the variable `mx1` by assigning it the maximum value between its current value and the integer representation of the reversed substring from `i` to `j` in the string `s`. However, the exact value of `j` is not specified, and the initial state does not provide the string `s`. Without these details, we can only say that `mx1` is updated based on the substring of `s` starting from index `i` up to but not including index `j`, which is reversed and then converted to an integer.

Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and the string `s` are not given, the impact on `mx1` cannot be precisely calculated. We know that `mx1` will take the maximum value between its current value and the new computed value from the substring operation.

Given the initial state: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at position `[i][j]` in the string `s` is not '0', the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at position `[i][j]` in the string `s` is not '0'; `mx1` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the integer representation of the reversed substring from `i` to `j` in the string `s`.**
