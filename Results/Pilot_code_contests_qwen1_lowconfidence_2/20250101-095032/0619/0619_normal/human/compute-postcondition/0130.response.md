Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- If `s[i][j]` is '0', then `mx0` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `int(s[1][:j][::-1], 2)`.
- If `s[i][j]` is not '0', then `mx1` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the integer value of the reversed substring of `s[1][:j]` interpreted in base 2.

### Loop Condition
The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

### Current Values
- `i` is currently 1
- `n` is greater than 0

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and become 2 (since it starts from 0).

### Adjusting States
Since the loop condition checks if `i < n`, and we know `n` is greater than 0, the only thing that changes is the value of `i`.

- `i` will now be 2
- `n` remains unchanged, but still needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to continue

### Updated State
State: **`i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0**
