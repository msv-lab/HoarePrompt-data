The code `ts = bin(i)[2:]` converts the string `i` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function and slices off the first two characters (`'0b'`) to get the actual binary digits.

Here are the steps:

1. `i` is initially `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.
2. The `bin()` function converts this string to its binary representation, which is `'0b00000000000000000000000000000000'`.
3. The `[2:]` slice removes the first two characters `'0b'`, leaving us with the binary string `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.

Therefore, `ts` is now the binary representation of `i`, which is `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`.

Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is '00000000000000000000000000000000', `ts` is '00000000000000000000000000000000'**
