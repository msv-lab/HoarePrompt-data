Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is '1', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 1, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is 2, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx1` is max(`mx1`, int(s[2][:0][::-1], 2)) which is `mx1` since int(s[2][:0][::-1], 2) evaluates to 0**
