Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If `s[2][j]` is '0', `mx0` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reverse substring of `s[2][:j]` in binary. If `s[2][j]` is not '0', `mx1` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the reverse substring of `s[2][:j]` in binary.***
