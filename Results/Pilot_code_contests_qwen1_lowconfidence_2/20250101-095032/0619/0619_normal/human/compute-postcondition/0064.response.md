`ans` is assigned the value of `ans` plus the character `'0'`. This means that the string `ans` now includes the character `'0'` at its end. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of the same 32-bit binary strings, `ans` is an empty string plus '0', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 0, `c0` is the count of '0's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1's at position `j` in the binary strings of `s`, `i` is `n`, `c1` is not equal to `n`, and the current value of `c0` is equal to `n`**.
