You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by converting each number to its binary representation, reversing it, and then constructing the optimal `X` by considering the most significant bits. However, the logic for determining the optimal `X` is flawed.

One specific issue is in the loop where it tries to determine the optimal value for `X`. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where both `c1` and `c0` are less than `n`, which indicates that no single bit can be universally set to `0` or `1` across all numbers. Instead, it incorrectly sets the next bit to `1` and then calculates the maximum values for `ansl` and `ansr`.

Here's an example to demonstrate the issue:

For the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The binary representations of the numbers are:
- 1 -> `00000000000000000000000000000001`
- 2 -> `00000000000000000000000000000010`
- 3 -> `00000000000000000000000000000011`

The program constructs the binary string `11111111111111111111111111111111` and then calculates `ansl` and `ansr` based on the presence of `0`s and `1`s at each bit position. This approach does not guarantee the minimum possible value of \(\max(a_i \oplus X)\).

A correct solution would involve a different approach, such as using the bitwise OR operation on all the numbers to determine the optimal `X`.

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It converts each integer in the array to a 32-bit binary string, reverses the binary string, and pads it with leading zeros if necessary. The function then iterates through the binary strings to construct a final binary string `ans`. If all bits in any position are the same, it sets the corresponding bit in `ans` accordingly. Otherwise, it determines the maximum value by flipping the bit in `ans` and considering the maximum XOR value with the original integers. Finally, it prints either the maximum XOR value when `ans` is all ones or the minimum of two possible maximum XOR values based on the constructed `ans`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
