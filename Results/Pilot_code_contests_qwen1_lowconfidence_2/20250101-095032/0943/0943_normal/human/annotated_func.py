#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < H // 2, where H is the number of elements in the binary heap represented by the input list.
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1
    #The program returns an integer that is 2 times i plus 1, where i is an integer such that 0 <= i < H // 2, and H is the number of elements in the binary heap represented by the input list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \frac{H}{2}\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap represented by the input list. It returns an integer which is calculated as \(2 \times i + 1\). This function does not modify any external state; it simply computes and returns the value based on the input `i`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code snippet.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < H // 2, where H is the number of elements in the binary heap represented as an array.
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2
    #The program returns 2 * i + 2, where i is an integer such that 0 <= i < H // 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \frac{H}{2}\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap represented as an array. It returns the value \(2 \times i + 2\). This means the function calculates and returns the index of the right child of the node at index `i` in a zero-indexed binary heap. Since the function only involves a simple arithmetic operation and does not modify any external state, there are no edge cases or missing functionality to consider.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 <= i < H, where H is the number of elements in the binary heap. The function calculates the index of the parent node for a given node index i.
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)
    #The program returns the integer value of ((i - 1) / 2), where i is an integer such that 1 <= i < H
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `i` such that \(1 \leq i < H\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap. It returns the integer value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), which represents the index of the parent node for the given node index `i`. The function correctly handles the case where \(i = 1\) by returning 0, as the parent of the root node (index 1) is considered to be at index 0. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap, i is an integer such that 0 < i < len(array), and item_num is an integer representing the size of the heap (item_num == len(array)).
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if (left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]) :
        largest = left
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap, `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`, `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap (item_num == len(array)), if `left < item_num` and `array[left] > array[largest]`, then `largest` is updated to `left`. Otherwise, `largest` remains unchanged.
    if (right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]) :
        largest = right
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap, `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`, `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap (item_num == len(array)), `largest` is updated to the index of the greater value between `right` and `left` if both `right < item_num` and `array[right] > array[largest]` hold true. Otherwise, `largest` remains unchanged.
    if (largest != i) :
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`, `item_num` is equal to `len(array)`, `largest` is updated to the index of the greater value between `right` and `left` if `largest` was initially not equal to `i`. If `largest` was equal to `i`, `largest` remains unchanged. After the operation, `array[i]` is equal to `array[largest]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` maintains the max-heap property for a binary heap represented by the list `array`. It takes a list `array` of integers, an index `i` indicating a position within the heap, and an integer `item_num` indicating the size of the heap. The function ensures that the element at index `i` and its children satisfy the max-heap property. If the element at index `i` is smaller than its left or right child, it swaps the element at index `i` with the larger child and recursively calls itself on the affected subtree. This process continues until the max-heap property is restored for the entire heap. Potential edge cases include when the index `i` is at a leaf node (i.e., `left` or `right` is equal to or exceeds `item_num`), in which case no swaps are needed. Additionally, the function does not alter `item_num` during its execution; it only uses it to determine the valid range for the heap.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: size is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, and array is an iterable containing integers. The length of the array is equal to size, and the array represents the initial state of the binary heap before calling the function to construct it into a max-heap.
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs a binary heap from the given array such that it becomes a max-heap. It reads the size of the array and the array itself from standard input. The function then calls `func_3` to determine the last non-leaf node index, and for each node from the last non-leaf to the root, it calls `func_4` to ensure the heap property is maintained. This process ensures that the array represents a max-heap upon completion. Potential edge cases include an empty array or a single-element array, which would result in no changes since a max-heap with one element is trivially a valid heap. If `func_3` or `func_4` do not exist or do not function as intended, the function will fail to properly construct the max-heap.
