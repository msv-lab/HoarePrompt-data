The function `func_2` accepts an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \frac{H}{2}\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap represented as an array. It returns the value \(2 \times i + 2\). This means the function calculates and returns the index of the right child of the node at index `i` in a zero-indexed binary heap. Since the function only involves a simple arithmetic operation and does not modify any external state, there are no edge cases or missing functionality to consider.
