The function `func_3` accepts an integer `i` such that \(1 \leq i < H\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap. It returns the integer value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), which represents the index of the parent node for the given node index `i`. The function correctly handles the case where \(i = 1\) by returning 0, as the parent of the root node (index 1) is considered to be at index 0. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.
