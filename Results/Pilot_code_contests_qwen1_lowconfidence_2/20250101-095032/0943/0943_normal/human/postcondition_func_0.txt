The function `func_1` accepts an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \frac{H}{2}\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap represented by the input list. It returns an integer which is calculated as \(2 \times i + 1\). This function does not modify any external state; it simply computes and returns the value based on the input `i`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code snippet.
