Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the `maxHeapify` function as described in the pseudo code. Specifically, the `func_4` function does not recursively call itself after swapping the elements, which is necessary to ensure the max-heap property is maintained throughout the subtree. This omission means that the program may fail to properly maintain the max-heap property, especially in cases where a swap is made and the newly swapped node requires further adjustments.

For example, consider the input:

```
10
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7
```

The provided program will construct a max-heap but will not recursively call `func_4` after swapping, which could lead to a violation of the max-heap property. For instance, after the initial pass, the heap might look correct, but subsequent values might violate the max-heap property due to the lack of recursive calls. Therefore, the program does not fully implement the `maxHeapify` function as required, making it incorrect.
