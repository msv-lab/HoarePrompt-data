Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not fully implement the `maxHeapify` function as described in the pseudo code. Specifically, the annotated version confirms that `func_4` performs the necessary comparisons and updates the largest value, but it fails to include the recursive call after swapping elements. This omission is critical because it ensures the max-heap property is maintained for the entire subtree. Without the recursive call, the program might fail to adjust deeper levels of the tree that were affected by the swap, leading to a violation of the max-heap property.

To be correct, the `func_4` function should include a recursive call after the swap, ensuring that the subtree rooted at the swapped node is also a max-heap. The current implementation, as annotated, does not perform this crucial step. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct according to the problem description.
