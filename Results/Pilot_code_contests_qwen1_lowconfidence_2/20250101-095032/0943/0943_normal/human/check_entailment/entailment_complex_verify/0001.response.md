Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The program correctly implements the construction of a max-heap using the `buildMaxHeap` function, which iteratively applies the `maxHeapify` operation to each node in a bottom-up manner. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly compute the indices for left child, right child, and parent nodes, respectively. The `func_4` function ensures that the max-heap property is maintained by swapping elements as necessary and recursively calling itself to adjust the heap. The `func_5` function reads the input correctly and processes it to form a valid max-heap. Given the annotated version, there are no logical flaws or edge cases that would invalidate the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
