Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully implement the logic required to construct a max-heap from an array as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_4` (which corresponds to `maxHeapify`) is implemented correctly for the purpose of maintaining the max-heap property, but the program lacks the necessary steps to ensure the entire array forms a valid max-heap from the bottom up.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Missing `buildMaxHeap` Function Implementation**:
   - The `buildMaxHeap` function is mentioned in the problem description but is not present in the provided code. This function should perform `maxHeapify` in a bottom-up manner as described in the pseudocode.

2. **Incomplete Execution**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input and calls `func_4` for nodes from `size // 2` down to `1`. However, this is not sufficient to ensure the entire array forms a max-heap. It only ensures that the subtrees rooted at these nodes are max-heaps, but the parent nodes may still violate the max-heap property with respect to their children.

3. **Incorrect State Management**:
   - The state management within `func_4` assumes that the array is already partially a max-heap, but without the `buildMaxHeap` function, there's no guarantee that this is the case. Therefore, `func_4` might not correctly re-establish the max-heap property for the entire array.

### Correct Implementation Approach:

To meet the requirements of the problem description, the program should include a `buildMaxHeap` function that iterates over the array from the last non-leaf node to the root, calling `maxHeapify` for each node. This ensures that the entire array is transformed into a valid max-heap.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program with the missing `buildMaxHeap` function:

```python
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_5()

#Function 1:
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1

#Function 2:
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2

#Function 3:
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)

#Function 4:
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if (left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]):
        largest = left
    if (right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]):
        largest = right
    if (largest != i):
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)

#Function 5:
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
    buildMaxHeap(array, size)

def buildMaxHeap(array, item_num):
    for i in reversed(range(func_3(item_num))):
        func_4(array, i, item_num)

    #State of the program after the buildMaxHeap function has been executed: 
    #The array is guaranteed to form a max-heap.

```

By including the `buildMaxHeap` function and ensuring it is called after reading the input, the program will correctly transform the array into a max-heap.
