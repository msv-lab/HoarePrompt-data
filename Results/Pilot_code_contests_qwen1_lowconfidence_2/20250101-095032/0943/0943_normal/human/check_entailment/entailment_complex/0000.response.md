Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code correctly implements the construction of a max-heap from an array. The code follows the problem description accurately for every potential case:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly calculate the left child, right child, and parent index, respectively, without any edge cases or missing functionalities. These functions are used appropriately within `func_4`.

2. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly performs the `maxHeapify` operation to ensure the max-heap property is maintained. It checks the left and right children of the current node, updates the `largest` index if necessary, and swaps elements to maintain the heap property. The recursive call ensures that the property is checked and maintained for the entire subtree.

3. **Function `func_5`**: This function reads the size and elements of the array from standard input, constructs the max-heap using `func_4`, and ensures the heap property is maintained for all nodes. It correctly handles the construction of the max-heap in a bottom-up manner by starting from the last non-leaf node and moving up to the root.

4. **Problem Description Matching**: The code aligns with the problem description, which states that the input is an array and the goal is to construct a max-heap. The code processes the input array correctly and ensures that the resulting structure satisfies the max-heap property.

Since the code correctly implements the max-heap construction algorithm as described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases (including edge cases like a single-element array), the code is correct.
