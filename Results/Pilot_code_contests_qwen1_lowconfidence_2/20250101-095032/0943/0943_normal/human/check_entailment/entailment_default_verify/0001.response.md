Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the `buildMaxHeap` function, which constructs a max-heap from the given array. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly compute the indices for the left child, right child, and parent of a node, respectively. The `func_4` function correctly performs the `maxHeapify` operation, ensuring that the heap property is maintained. The `func_5` function reads the input correctly, determines the last non-leaf node, and calls `func_4` in a bottom-up manner to build the max-heap. Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the program behaves as expected and correctly constructs a max-heap from the given array. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would render the program incorrect based on the given inputs and constraints.
