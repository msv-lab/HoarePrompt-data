Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program follows the problem description correctly. It uses the `func_4` function to perform the `maxHeapify` operation on each node in a bottom-up manner, starting from the last non-leaf node (which is at index `H/2 - 1`). This ensures that the entire array is transformed into a valid max-heap according to the given max-heap property. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to calculate the left child, right child, and parent indices, respectively, which are correctly implemented. Given the input example, the output matches the expected result, and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that would cause the program to fail.
