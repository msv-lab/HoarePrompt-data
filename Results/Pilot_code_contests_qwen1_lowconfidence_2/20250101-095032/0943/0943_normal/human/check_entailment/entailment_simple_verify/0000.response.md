Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not fully implement the `maxHeapify` function as described in the pseudo code. Specifically, the `func_4` function does not include the recursive call to `maxHeapify` after swapping the elements. The annotated version confirms that after swapping, the function does not check if the newly swapped element requires further adjustments to maintain the max-heap property. This omission can lead to a violation of the max-heap property, especially in cases where a swap is made and the newly swapped node requires further adjustments.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7
```

The provided program will perform the initial passes of `func_4` to build a max-heap but will not recursively call `func_4` after swapping, which could lead to a violation of the max-heap property. For instance, after the initial pass, the heap might look correct, but subsequent values might violate the max-heap property due to the lack of recursive calls.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program does not fully implement the `maxHeapify` function as required, making it incorrect.
