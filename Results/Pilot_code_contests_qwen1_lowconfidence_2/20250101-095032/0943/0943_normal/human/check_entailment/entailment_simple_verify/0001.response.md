Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the `maxHeapify` function and the `buildMaxHeap` procedure as described in the problem statement. 

1. **Correct Implementation of `func_1` and `func_2`:**
   - These functions correctly compute the indices of the left and right children of a node, respectively.
   - The annotations confirm that these functions operate within the expected range.

2. **Correct Implementation of `func_3`:**
   - This function computes the index of the parent node for a given node index, ensuring that the calculation is valid for the range of the heap.
   - The annotations confirm that this function operates correctly.

3. **Correct Implementation of `func_4` (`maxHeapify`):**
   - The `maxHeapify` function correctly identifies the largest value among the node and its children and swaps them if necessary.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the subtree rooted at the node is also a max-heap.
   - The annotations confirm that this function operates correctly for the given conditions.

4. **Correct Implementation of `func_5` (`buildMaxHeap`):**
   - The `buildMaxHeap` function iterates over the nodes in a bottom-up manner, applying `maxHeapify` to each node.
   - The annotations confirm that this function operates correctly and ensures that the entire heap satisfies the max-heap property.

Given the annotations and the original assessment, the program correctly constructs a max-heap from the given array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **True**.
