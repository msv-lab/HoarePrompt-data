You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary heap which satisfies max-heap property is called max-heap. In a max-heap, for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[i] \leq A[parent(i)]$, that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. The largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.

Here is an example of a max-heap.

<image>


Write a program which reads an array and constructs a max-heap from the array based on the following pseudo code.

$maxHeapify(A, i)$ move the value of $A[i]$ down to leaves to make a sub-tree of node $i$ a max-heap. Here, $H$ is the size of the heap.


1  maxHeapify(A, i)
2      l = left(i)
3      r = right(i)
4      // select the node which has the maximum value
5      if l ≤ H and A[l] > A[i]
6          largest = l
7      else
8          largest = i
9      if r ≤ H and A[r] > A[largest]
10         largest = r
11
12     if largest ≠ i　// value of children is larger than that of i
13         swap A[i] and A[largest]
14         maxHeapify(A, largest) // call recursively


The following procedure buildMaxHeap(A) makes $A$ a max-heap by performing maxHeapify in a bottom-up manner.


1 buildMaxHeap(A)
2    for i = H/2 downto 1
3        maxHeapify(A, i)




Input

In the first line, an integer $H$ is given. In the second line, $H$ integers which represent elements in the binary heap are given in order of node id (from $1$ to $H$).

Output

Print values of nodes in the max-heap in order of their id (from $1$ to $H$). Print a single space character before each value.

Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_5()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \frac{H}{2}\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap represented by the input list. It returns an integer which is calculated as \(2 \times i + 1\). This function does not modify any external state; it simply computes and returns the value based on the input `i`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code snippet.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \frac{H}{2}\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap represented as an array. It returns the value \(2 \times i + 2\). This means the function calculates and returns the index of the right child of the node at index `i` in a zero-indexed binary heap. Since the function only involves a simple arithmetic operation and does not modify any external state, there are no edge cases or missing functionality to consider.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts an integer `i` such that \(1 \leq i < H\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap. It returns the integer value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), which represents the index of the parent node for the given node index `i`. The function correctly handles the case where \(i = 1\) by returning 0, as the parent of the root node (index 1) is considered to be at index 0. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]:
        largest = left
    if right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]:
        largest = right
    if largest != i:
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` maintains the max-heap property for a binary heap represented by the list `array`. It takes a list `array` of integers, an index `i` indicating a position within the heap, and an integer `item_num` indicating the size of the heap. The function ensures that the element at index `i` and its children satisfy the max-heap property. If the element at index `i` is smaller than its left or right child, it swaps the element at index `i` with the larger child and recursively calls itself on the affected subtree. This process continues until the max-heap property is restored for the entire heap. Potential edge cases include when the index `i` is at a leaf node (i.e., `left` or `right` is equal to or exceeds `item_num`), in which case no swaps are needed. Additionally, the function does not alter `item_num` during its execution; it only uses it to determine the valid range for the heap.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function constructs a binary heap from the given array such that it becomes a max-heap. It reads the size of the array and the array itself from standard input. The function then calls `func_3` to determine the last non-leaf node index, and for each node from the last non-leaf to the root, it calls `func_4` to ensure the heap property is maintained. This process ensures that the array represents a max-heap upon completion. Potential edge cases include an empty array or a single-element array, which would result in no changes since a max-heap with one element is trivially a valid heap. If `func_3` or `func_4` do not exist or do not function as intended, the function will fail to properly construct the max-heap.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
