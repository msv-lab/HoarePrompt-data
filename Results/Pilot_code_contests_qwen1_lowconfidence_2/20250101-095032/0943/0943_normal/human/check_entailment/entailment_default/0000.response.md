Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. Let's break it down:

1. **Input Reading**: The function `func_5` reads the size of the heap and the heap elements from standard input, ensuring it handles the input as specified.

2. **Building the Max-Heap**: The function `func_5` calls `func_3` to determine the last non-leaf node and then iterates from the last non-leaf node to the root, calling `func_4` to maintain the max-heap property. This ensures that the entire heap is constructed correctly according to the max-heap property.

3. **Max-Heapify Function**: The function `func_4` correctly implements the max-heapify algorithm. It checks the left and right children of the current node and swaps the current node with the largest child if necessary. It then recursively calls itself to ensure the max-heap property is maintained for the affected subtree. The function handles all edge cases appropriately, such as when the current node is a leaf node.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases like an empty array or a single-element array trivially. An empty array results in no changes, and a single-element array is already a valid max-heap.

Given that the code follows the provided pseudo-code and handles all described cases correctly, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
