Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the construction of a max-heap from an array as described in the problem. The function `func_5` reads the size of the heap and the heap elements from standard input, and then calls `func_4` in a bottom-up manner to ensure the max-heap property is maintained for each node from the last non-leaf node to the root.

The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly compute the indices for the left child, right child, and parent of a given node, respectively. These functions are used correctly within `func_4`, which recursively ensures the max-heap property for each node.

Potential edge cases, such as an empty array or a single-element array, are handled correctly by the code, as an empty heap or a single-element heap is already a valid max-heap. The code also correctly handles the range of indices to avoid accessing out-of-bounds elements in the array.

Given that the code follows the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
