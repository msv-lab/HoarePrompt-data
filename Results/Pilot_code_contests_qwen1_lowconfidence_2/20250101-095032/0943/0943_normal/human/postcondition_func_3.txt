The function `func_4` maintains the max-heap property for a binary heap represented by the list `array`. It takes a list `array` of integers, an index `i` indicating a position within the heap, and an integer `item_num` indicating the size of the heap. The function ensures that the element at index `i` and its children satisfy the max-heap property. If the element at index `i` is smaller than its left or right child, it swaps the element at index `i` with the larger child and recursively calls itself on the affected subtree. This process continues until the max-heap property is restored for the entire heap. Potential edge cases include when the index `i` is at a leaf node (i.e., `left` or `right` is equal to or exceeds `item_num`), in which case no swaps are needed. Additionally, the function does not alter `item_num` during its execution; it only uses it to determine the valid range for the heap.
