The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `array`, `i`, and `item_num`. 

- `array` is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap.
- `i` is an integer such that 0 < i < len(array).
- `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap (item_num == len(array)).

Based on the output cases provided, the function checks the position `i` in the binary heap represented by `array` and returns information about the heap structure at that position. However, since no specific return values are given in the output description, we can only state the parameters and the nature of the function's operation based on the constraints provided.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a list `array` of integers representing the elements of a binary heap, an integer `i` indicating a position within the heap, and an integer `item_num` indicating the size of the heap. The function likely performs operations related to maintaining the binary heap property at position `i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` of integers representing the elements of a binary heap, an integer `i` indicating a position within the heap, and an integer `item_num` indicating the size of the heap.**
