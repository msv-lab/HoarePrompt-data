The function `func_4(array, i, size)` is called with three arguments: `array`, `i`, and `size`. However, the values of these arguments are not specified in the initial state or the function definitions provided. Additionally, no changes to the variables are made within the call to `func_4`. Therefore, the variables `size` and `func_3(size)` retain their initial states, and the values of `array` and `i` are not specified but are assumed to be unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is a positive integer, `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer, the values of `array` and `i` are unspecified**
