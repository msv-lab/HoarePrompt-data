Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`, `item_num` is equal to `len(array)`, `largest` is updated to the index of the greater value between `right` and `left` if `largest` was initially not equal to `i`. If `largest` was equal to `i`, `largest` remains unchanged. After the operation, `array[i]` is equal to `array[largest]`.***
