The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `size`. This integer is expected to represent the number of elements in the array. Since the exact value read from the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `size`. However, we know it is a positive integer.

The initial state includes that `size` is a positive integer and the array is an iterable containing integers. After executing the given line of code, the array remains unchanged, and `size` is updated with the value read from the input.

Output State: **size is an integer read from standard input (positive), and the array is an iterable containing integers.**
