The line of code `array[i] = array[largest]` assigns the value at the `largest` index in the list `array` to the index `i` in the list `array`. This changes the value at index `i` in the `array` list.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `array` is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap.
- `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`.
- `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap (item_num == len(array)).
- `largest` is updated to the index of the greater value between `right` and `left` if both `right < item_num` and `array[right] > array[largest]` hold true, otherwise `largest` remains unchanged, and `largest` is not equal to `i`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap, `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`, `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap (item_num == len(array)), `largest` is updated to the index of the greater value between `right` and `left` if both `right < item_num` and `array[right] > array[largest]` hold true, otherwise `largest` remains unchanged, and `largest` is not equal to `i`, `array[i]` is now equal to `array[largest]`.**
