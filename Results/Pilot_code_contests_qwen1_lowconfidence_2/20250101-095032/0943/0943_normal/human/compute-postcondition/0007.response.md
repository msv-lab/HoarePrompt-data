Output State: **`size` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev - 2`, `array` is the same as the previous state after `func_4(array, i, size)`**.

The function `func_4(array, i, size)` is called with the given arguments, but the specific implementation of `func_4` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes to the `array`. However, we know that `i` is updated to `i_prev - 2`, and `array` remains unchanged from its previous state after the call to `func_4`. The value of `size` remains a positive integer as it was in the initial state.
