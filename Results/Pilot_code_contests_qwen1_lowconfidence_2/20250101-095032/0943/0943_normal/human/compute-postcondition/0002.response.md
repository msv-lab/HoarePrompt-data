State before the loop starts: `size` is an integer read from standard input (positive); `array` is an iterator of integers derived from the input.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop uses `range(0, func_3(size))`, and it iterates in reverse order using `reversed()`.
   - The loop will execute as long as the range is non-empty, meaning `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `size` is already given as a positive integer read from standard input.
   - `array` is an iterator of integers derived from the input, but its state is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer. This means the loop will iterate over a range of indices starting from 0 up to (but not including) `func_3(size) - 1`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `size` is positive, we know the loop will start, but we need to ensure `func_3(size)` returns a value that allows the loop to run at least once.
   - `i` will start from `func_3(size) - 1` and decrement in each iteration until it reaches 0.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `size` is a positive integer.
- `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer to allow the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`size` is a positive integer, `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer**
