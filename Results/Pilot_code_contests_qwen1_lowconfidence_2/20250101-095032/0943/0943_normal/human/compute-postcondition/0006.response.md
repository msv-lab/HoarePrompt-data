To solve this task, let's break down the information provided and the logic of the for loop.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `size` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `i_prev - 1`.
   - `array` has been modified by `func_4(array, i, size)`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(0, func_3(size))` in reverse order.
   - `i` starts from `func_3(size) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is `i_prev - 1` (where `i_prev` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be decremented from its current value to reach the next lower value within the range defined by `func_3(size)`.

5. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop is in reverse order, `i` should be `i_prev - 1` in the next iteration.
   - The range is defined by `func_3(size)`, so `i` must still be within this range.

6. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` needs to be `i_prev - 2` for the next iteration (since it was `i_prev - 1` before).
   - `size` remains unchanged as it is used to define the range but is not directly modified by the loop.
   - `array` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop itself, only referenced and possibly modified by `func_4`.

**Final State:**
- `size` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `i_prev - 2`.
- `array` is the same as the previous state after `func_4(array, i, size)`.

State: **`size` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev - 2`, `array` is modified by `func_4(array, i, size)`**
