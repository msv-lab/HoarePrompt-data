The code reads a line from standard input, strips it, splits it by spaces, and then maps each element to an integer using a lambda function. This means that the `array` variable is now an iterator of integers derived from the input.

Let's denote the input as a sequence of space-separated integers. For example, if the input is "1 2 3 4", the code will convert this into an iterator `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

The `size` variable remains unchanged as it was read from standard input before the code execution and is not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`size` is an integer read from standard input (positive); `array` is an iterator of integers derived from the input**
