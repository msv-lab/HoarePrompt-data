The code snippet `array[largest] = tmp` assigns the value of `tmp` to the index `largest` in the list `array`. The value of `tmp` was previously stored in `array[i]`, which is now equal to `array[largest]`. Since `largest` is not equal to `i`, `array[i]` is no longer the original value it held before. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers where `array[largest]` is now equal to `tmp`; `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`; `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap (`item_num == len(array)`); `largest` is updated to the index of the greater value between `right` and `left` if both `right < item_num` and `array[right] > array[largest]` hold true, otherwise `largest` remains unchanged; and `largest` is not equal to `i`; `array[i]` is now equal to `array[largest]`.**
