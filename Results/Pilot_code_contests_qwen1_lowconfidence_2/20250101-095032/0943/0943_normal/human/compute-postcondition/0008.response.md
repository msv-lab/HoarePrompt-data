To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given loop and the output states after a few iterations.

### Loop Analysis
The loop is structured as follows:
```python
for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
    func_4(array, i, size)
```
- `size` is a positive integer.
- `func_3(size)` returns a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations the loop will run.
- `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))` means the loop starts from `func_3(size) - 1` and decrements down to 0.

### Iteration Analysis
Let's consider the output states provided for the first few iterations:

- **After 1 iteration:**
  - `size` is a positive integer.
  - `i` is `func_3(size) - 1`.
  - `array` is modified by `func_4(array, i, size)`.

- **After 2 iterations:**
  - `size` is a positive integer.
  - `i` is `i_prev - 1`, where `i_prev` was `func_3(size) - 1`.
  - `array` is modified by `func_4(array, i, size)`.

- **After 3 iterations:**
  - `size` is a positive integer.
  - `i` is `i_prev - 2`, where `i_prev` was `func_3(size) - 2`.
  - `array` is modified by `func_4(array, i, size)`.

### General Pattern
From the above iterations, we can infer that:
- The loop will run exactly `func_3(size)` times.
- Each time the loop runs, `i` decreases by 1 starting from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0.
- The function `func_4(array, i, size)` modifies the array each time.

### Final State After All Iterations
Since the loop runs `func_3(size)` times and `i` is decremented each time until it reaches 0, the final state after all iterations will be:
- `size` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `i` will be 0 after the last iteration.
- `array` will be modified by `func_4(array, i, size)` for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0.

### Output State
Given that the loop runs `func_3(size)` times and modifies the array `func_4(array, i, size)` for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0, the final state of the array after the loop completes will be the result of these modifications.

**Output State:**
- `size` is a positive integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `array` is modified by `func_4(array, i, size)` for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0.

**Final Output State:**
**Output State: **`size` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `array` is modified by `func_4(array, i, size)` for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0.
