Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their States:**
   - `size`: A positive integer.
   - `func_3(size)`: Must return a positive integer.
   - `array`: The values are unspecified.
   - `i`: Its value is unspecified.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.
   - This means `i` starts from `func_3(size) - 1` and decrements until it reaches 0.

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an unspecified value (letâ€™s call it `i_prev`).
   - Since the loop is using `reversed(range())`, `i` decreases by 1 each iteration.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev - 1`.

4. **Update the Function Call:**
   - The function `func_3(size)` must still return a positive integer because the loop relies on its return value to define the range.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `size` remains the same as it is a positive integer.
   - `func_3(size)` still must return a positive integer.
   - `i` should now be `i_prev - 1`.

Given these points, we can construct the new state as follows:

State: **`size` is a positive integer, `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev - 1`**.

Since `i` was unspecified before, let's denote it as `i_prev` for clarity, where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev - 1`.

State: **`size` is a positive integer, `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev - 1`**.
