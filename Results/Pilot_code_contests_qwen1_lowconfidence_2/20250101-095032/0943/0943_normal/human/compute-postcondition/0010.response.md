Functionality: **The function constructs a binary heap from the given array such that it becomes a max-heap. It reads the size of the array and the array itself from standard input. The function then calls `func_3` to determine the last non-leaf node index, and for each node from the last non-leaf to the root, it calls `func_4` to ensure the heap property is maintained. This process ensures that the array represents a max-heap upon completion. Potential edge cases include an empty array or a single-element array, which would result in no changes since a max-heap with one element is trivially a valid heap. If `func_3` or `func_4` do not exist or do not function as intended, the function will fail to properly construct the max-heap.**
