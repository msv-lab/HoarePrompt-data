The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `size`, which is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, and `array`, which is an iterable containing integers. The length of the array is equal to `size`, and the array represents the initial state of the binary heap before calling the function to construct it into a max-heap.

The function does not return any value based on the given output cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept a positive integer `size` and an iterable `array` and construct the binary heap represented by `array` into a max-heap.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `size` and an iterable `array` representing the initial state of the binary heap before calling the function to construct it into a max-heap.**
