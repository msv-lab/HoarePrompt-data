The function `func_4(array, largest, item_num)` is called, which typically represents a part of the heapify process in a heap data structure, specifically adjusting the tree to maintain the heap property. However, without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only infer the changes based on the provided conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of integers.
- `array[largest]` is equal to `tmp`.
- `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`.
- `item_num` is equal to `len(array)`.
- `largest` is updated to the index of the greater value between `right` and `left` if both `right < item_num` and `array[right] > array[largest]` hold true, otherwise `largest` remains unchanged.
- `largest` is not equal to `i`.
- `array[i]` is now equal to `array[largest]`.

After calling `func_4(array, largest, item_num)`, the following changes occur:
- `array[largest]` was equal to `tmp`, and after the call, `array[i]` is now equal to `array[largest]`, implying that `array[largest]` is now `array[i]`.
- `largest` might have been updated within the function, but since the function's exact behavior is not specified, we cannot determine the new value of `largest` precisely. However, it is mentioned that `largest` is not equal to `i`, so this condition is preserved.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `array` is a list of integers where `array[i]` is now equal to `array[largest]` (which was previously `array[largest] = tmp`).
- `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`.
- `item_num` is equal to `len(array)`.
- `largest` is updated within the function but is not equal to `i`.
- The heap property should still be maintained.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers where `array[i]` is now equal to `array[largest]` (which was previously `array[largest] = tmp`), `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(array)`, `item_num` is equal to `len(array)`, `largest` is updated within the function but is not equal to `i`.**
