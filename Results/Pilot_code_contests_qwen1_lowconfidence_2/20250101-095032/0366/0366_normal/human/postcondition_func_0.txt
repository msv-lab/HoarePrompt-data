The function `func_1(u)` takes an integer `u` (where \(1 \leq u \leq n\)), a list of adjacency lists `e`, and a boolean list `vis` initialized to `False`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to mark the vertices reachable from `u` using the signs indicated by the edges in `e`. If it finds any inconsistency in the signs (i.e., if an edge indicates a "love" relationship but the signs of the two endpoints do not match, or if an edge indicates a "hate" relationship but the signs of the two endpoints do not contradict), it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Specifically:
- It initializes `sz` to the number of edges connected to vertex `u`.
- For each edge `(v, c)` connected to `u`, it checks if `v` has already been visited. If not, it marks `v` with a consistent sign based on the edge type (`c`). If `c` is `True` (love), `v` is marked with the same sign as `u`; if `c` is `False` (hate), `v` is marked with the opposite sign of `u`.
- If it finds an inconsistency during the DFS, it immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any inconsistencies, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `u` is out of bounds (i.e., \(u < 1\) or \(u > n\)). This should be handled separately before calling `func_1`.
- The function does not initialize `vis` internally; it assumes `vis` is passed as an argument and is already initialized to `False`. If `vis` is not properly initialized, the function's behavior could be undefined.
