The code `u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `c`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `u`, `v`, and `c`. However, we know they are now integers.

The output state includes the updated values of `u`, `v`, and `c`, and the fact that `raw_input()` has been used to read input, which means the subsequent code would depend on these values.

Output State: **`u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `c` is an integer**
