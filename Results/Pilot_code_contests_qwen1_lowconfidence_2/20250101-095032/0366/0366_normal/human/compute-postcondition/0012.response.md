The code appends `[u, c]` to the adjacency list `e[v]`. Let's analyze the changes:

- `v` is initially set to `first_input_u - 1`.
- `u` is initially set to `first_input_u - 1`.
- `c` is the third integer input.

So, the line `e[v].append([u, c])` will add `[u, c]` to the adjacency list of node `v`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\).
- `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` now contains `[v, c]` in addition to its previous elements.
- `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `u` is `first_input_u - 1`.
- `v` is `first_input_u - 1`.
- `c` is the third integer input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[v]` now contains `[u, c]` in addition to its previous elements; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `1`; `u` is `first_input_u - 1`; `v` is `first_input_u - 1`; `c` is the third integer input.**
