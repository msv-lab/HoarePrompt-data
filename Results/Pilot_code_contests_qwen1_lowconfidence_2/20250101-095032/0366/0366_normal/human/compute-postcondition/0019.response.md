Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each pair \((i, j)\) with \(0 \leq i < n\) and \(0 \leq j < n\), if there is an edge between \(i\) and \(j\), then `e[i]` and `e[j]` both contain the pair \([j, c]\) and \([i, c]\) for some integer \(c\) representing the weight of the edge; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `m - 1`; `u` is the last `u` value entered; `v` is the last `v` value entered; `c` is the last `c` value entered.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, it takes three integers `u`, `v`, and `c` as input, and appends the edge \([v, c]\) to `e[u]` and the edge \([u, c]\) to `e[v]`.
- After `m` iterations, the list `e` will contain all the edges specified by the inputs.
- The variables `vis`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `c` will hold the values of the last inputs provided, because the loop updates these variables in each iteration.
- If the loop does not execute (`m == 0`), then `e` will be a list of empty adjacency lists, `vis` will still be a list of `False` values, and `i`, `u`, `v`, and `c` will retain their initial values, which are not specified in the initial state.
