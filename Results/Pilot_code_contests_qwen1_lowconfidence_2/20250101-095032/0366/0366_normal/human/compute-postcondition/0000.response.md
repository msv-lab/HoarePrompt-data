The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `e` and `vis` remain unchanged. Since the input is read using `raw_input()`, the values of `n` and `m` will be the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `m` is the integer entered by the user such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c (0 ≤ c ≤ 1), and `vis` is a boolean list of length n initialized to False.**
