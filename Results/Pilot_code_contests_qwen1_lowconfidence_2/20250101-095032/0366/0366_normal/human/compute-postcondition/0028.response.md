Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\), and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered. If `func_1(i)` is `False`, then `cnt` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.***
