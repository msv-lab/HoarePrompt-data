The code `u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `c`. 

- The initial state is: `n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` contains `[v, c]` and `[u, c]`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `1`; `u` is a specific integer value; `v` is `u - 2`; `c` is an integer entered by the user.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `u` is assigned the first integer input.
- `v` is assigned the second integer input.
- `c` is assigned the third integer input.

Since the initial values of `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, `i`, and `v` are not altered by this line of code, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` contains `[v, c]` and `[u, c]`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `1`; `u` is the first integer input; `v` is the first integer input - 2; `c` is the third integer input.**
