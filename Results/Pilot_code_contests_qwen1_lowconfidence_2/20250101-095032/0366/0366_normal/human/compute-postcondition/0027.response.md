The code `break` is executed within a loop or conditional statement, causing the loop or conditional statement to exit without further execution of the current iteration or block. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, only indicating the exit of the loop or conditional statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\), and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
