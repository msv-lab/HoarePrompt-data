The code snippet `ans %= mod` performs a modulo operation on `ans` using the value of `mod`. However, the value of `mod` is not provided in the initial state, and no specific value for `ans` is given other than it is initially 0. Since the operation modifies `ans` in place, the new value of `ans` will be the remainder of its current value divided by `mod`.

Given that `ans` was initially 0, the result of `ans %= mod` will also be 0, regardless of the value of `mod` (as long as `mod` is a positive integer).

Therefore, the only change is to the `ans` variable, which is now 0 modulo `mod`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `cnt` elements are set to `True`, `i` is `cnt - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is at least 1.**
