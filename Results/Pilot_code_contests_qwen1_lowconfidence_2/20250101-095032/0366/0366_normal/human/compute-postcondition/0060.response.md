The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `e`, and `vis`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 000.
- `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, 000.
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` with weight `c` (0 ≤ c ≤ 1).
- `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`.

The output of the function depends on the internal logic, but based on the provided information, we know:

- Case_1: The function returns something related to the graph represented by `n`, `m`, and `e`.
- Case_2: The function returns something related to the `vis` list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, and `vis` and return a result based on the graph represented by these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, and `vis`, and returns a result based on the graph represented by these parameters.**
