`vis[i]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the value of `i` is marked as visited in the `vis` list. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[i]` set to `True`, `i` is `m`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is either 0 or the value it had when the loop or if statement was exited, depending on whether `vis[i]` was `False` or `True` initially.**
