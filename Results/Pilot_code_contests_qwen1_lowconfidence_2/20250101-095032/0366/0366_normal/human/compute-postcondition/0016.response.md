`v` is decremented by 1. The value of `u` remains unchanged as it was an integer decreased by 1, and the value of `c` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is an integer decreased by 1, `v` is an integer decreased by 1, `c` is an integer.

Output State: **`u` is an integer decreased by 1, `v` is an integer decreased by 1, `c` is an integer**
