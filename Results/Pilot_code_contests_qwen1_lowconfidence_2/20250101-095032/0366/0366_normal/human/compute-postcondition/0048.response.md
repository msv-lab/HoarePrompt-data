Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `cnt + 1` elements are set to `True`, `i` is `m - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is 0. Since the if condition `cnt == 0` is true, `ans` remains 0 and no other changes occur.***
