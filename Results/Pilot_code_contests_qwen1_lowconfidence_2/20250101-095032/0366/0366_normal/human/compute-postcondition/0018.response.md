`e[v]` is updated to include the list `[u, c]` as an additional element. Since `v` is an integer decreased by 1, `u` is also an integer decreased by 1, and `c` is an integer, the structure of `e[v]` changes to include this new list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is an integer decreased by 1; `v` is an integer decreased by 1; `c` is an integer; `e[v-1]` now includes `[v-1, c]` and `[u, c]`.

Output State: **`u` is an integer decreased by 1; `v` is an integer decreased by 1; `c` is an integer; `e[v-1]` now includes `[v-1, c]` and `[u, c]`.**
