`cnt` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True` and `vis[m + 1]` set to `True`; `i` is `m + 1`; `u` is the last `u` value entered; `v` is the last `v` value entered; `c` is the last `c` value entered; `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.**
