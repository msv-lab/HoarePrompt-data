`vis[i]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `i` is `m - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\), and `m - 1 < n`, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is 0, and `vis[i]` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\), and `m - 1 < n`, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is 0, and `vis[i]` is `True`.**
