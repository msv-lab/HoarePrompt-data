`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `i`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `vis`, and `e` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[i]` set to `True`, `i` is `m`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is 1 more than its previous value.
