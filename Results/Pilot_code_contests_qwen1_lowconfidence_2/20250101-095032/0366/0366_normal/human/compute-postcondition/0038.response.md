The code `vis[i] = True` sets the value of `vis[i]` to `True`. Given that `i` is `m + 1`, this means `vis[m + 1]` is now `True`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True` and `vis[m + 1]` set to `True`; `i` is `m + 1`; `u` is the last `u` value entered; `v` is the last `v` value entered; `c` is the last `c` value entered; `cnt` remains unchanged.**
