The code `ans *= 2` multiplies the value of `ans` by 2. Since the initial state of `ans` is 0 modulo `mod`, multiplying 0 by 2 still results in 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0 modulo `mod`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `cnt + 1` elements are set to `True`, `i` is `cnt`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is at least 1, and `ans` is 0.**
