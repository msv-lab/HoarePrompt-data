Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True`; `i` is `m`; `u` is the last `u` value entered; `v` is the last `v` value entered; `c` is the last `c` value entered; `cnt` is 0 if `func_1(m)` returns `False`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.***
