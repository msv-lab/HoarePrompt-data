To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop can run. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = m-1`, meaning `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute even once.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `m`:** Since the loop runs `m` times, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
2. **Variable `i`:** At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. **List `e`:** The list `e` is only used within the loop body, but it doesn't directly affect whether the loop can execute. However, we need to ensure that `e` is defined and properly formatted as described.
4. **Boolean list `vis`:** Similar to `e`, `vis` is used within the loop but does not affect the loop execution itself. It just needs to be properly defined as a boolean list of length `n`.

Given these considerations, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `m` is the integer entered by the user such that `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c (0 ≤ c ≤ 1), and `vis` is a boolean list of length n initialized to False, `i` is 0.**
