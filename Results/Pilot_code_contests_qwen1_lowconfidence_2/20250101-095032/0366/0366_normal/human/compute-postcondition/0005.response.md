The code `e[u].append([v, c])` appends a new pair `[v, c]` to the list `e[u]`. Here, `u` is a specific index and `v` and `c` are also specific values provided by the user.

Before the code executes, the following is known:
- `n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\).
- `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists, where each `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` representing edges from node `i` to node `j` with weight `c`.
- `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `u` is a specific integer value.
- `v` is `u - 2`.
- `c` is an integer entered by the user.

After executing the code, the list `e[u]` will have a new element `[v, c]` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `0`; `u` is a specific integer value; `v` is `u - 2`; `c` is an integer entered by the user; `e[u]` now contains an additional element `[v, c]` appended to it.**
