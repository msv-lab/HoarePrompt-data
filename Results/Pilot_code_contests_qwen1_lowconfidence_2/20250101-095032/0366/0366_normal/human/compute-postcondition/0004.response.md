The code `v -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `v`. The initial state of `v` is `u - 1`, so after executing this line of code, `v` will be updated to `(u - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `u - 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `m` is the integer entered by the user such that m must be greater than or equal to 1, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c (0 ≤ c ≤ 1), `vis` is a boolean list of length n initialized to False, `i` is 0, `u` is `u`, `v` is `u - 2`, and `c` is the integer entered by the user.**
