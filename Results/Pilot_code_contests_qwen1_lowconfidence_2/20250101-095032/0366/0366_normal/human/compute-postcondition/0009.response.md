The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Given the initial state where `u` is the first integer input (let's call this value `first_input_u`), the new value of `u` will be `first_input_u - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` contains `[v, c]` and `[u, c]`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `1`; `u` is `first_input_u - 1`; `v` is the first integer input - 2; `c` is the third integer input.**
