`u` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `m` is the integer entered by the user such that m must be greater than or equal to 1, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c (0 ≤ c ≤ 1), `vis` is a boolean list of length n initialized to False, `i` is 0, `u` is `u - 1`, `v`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user.**
