The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans`, which is currently 0. Since printing a value does not change any variables, the only change is that the value of `ans` is printed. However, the value of `ans` itself remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` where exactly `cnt` elements are set to `True`, `i` is `cnt - 1` if `cnt > 0`, otherwise `i` is `m - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is at least 1.**
