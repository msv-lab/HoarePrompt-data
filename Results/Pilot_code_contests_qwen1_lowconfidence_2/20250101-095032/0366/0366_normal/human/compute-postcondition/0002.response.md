The code `u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `c`. It does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, or `i`.

- `u`, `v`, and `c` are assigned the values read from the input, which are integers.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `m` is the integer entered by the user such that m must be greater than or equal to 1, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c (0 ≤ c ≤ 1), `vis` is a boolean list of length n initialized to False, `i` is 0, `u`, `v`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user.**
