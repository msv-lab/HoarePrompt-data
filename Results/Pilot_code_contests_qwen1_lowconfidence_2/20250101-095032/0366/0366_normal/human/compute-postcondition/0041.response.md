The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the current loop or conditional block. Given the initial state, none of the variables are within a loop or conditional block that would be exited by this `break` statement. Therefore, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[m]` set to `True` and `vis[m + 1]` set to `True`; `i` is `m + 1`; `u` is the last `u` value entered; `v` is the last `v` value entered; `c` is the last `c` value entered; `cnt` is `0`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
