The code appends a new element `[v, c]` to the list `e[u]`. The variables `u` and `v` are already defined as `first_input_u - 1` and `first_input_v - 3` respectively, and `c` is the third integer input. The list `e[u]` now includes this new element, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` now contains `[v, c]` in addition to its previous elements; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `1`; `u` is `first_input_u - 1`; `v` is the first integer input minus 3; `c` is the third integer input.**
