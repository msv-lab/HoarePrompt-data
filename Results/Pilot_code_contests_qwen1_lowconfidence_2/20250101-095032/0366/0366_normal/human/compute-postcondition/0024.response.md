`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is `m - 1`, and `vis[i]` is `True`. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\), and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is 1, and `vis[i]` is `True`.**
