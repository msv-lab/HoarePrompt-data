The code `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `c`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\), `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\) and \(m - 1 < n\), `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` with `vis[i]` set to `True` for `i` equal to `m`, `i` is `m`, `u` is the last `u` value entered, `v` is the last `v` value entered, `c` is the last `c` value entered, `cnt` is 0.**
