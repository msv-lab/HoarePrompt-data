The code appends a new element `[u, c]` to the list `e[v]`. Before the code execution, `e[u]` already contained `[v, c]`. After executing the code, `e[v]` will now also contain `[u, c]`.

- `n` remains an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\).
- `m` remains an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `e` remains a list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains pairs `[j, c]` for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c. Specifically, `e[u]` now contains both `[v, c]` and `[u, c]`.
- `vis` remains a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`.
- `i` remains `0`.
- `u` remains a specific integer value.
- `v` remains `u - 2`.
- `c` remains an integer entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100{,}000\); `m` is an integer entered by the user such that \(m \geq 1\); `e` is a list of adjacency lists where `e[u]` contains `[v, c]` and `[u, c]`; `vis` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `i` is `0`; `u` is a specific integer value; `v` is `u - 2`; `c` is an integer entered by the user.**
