Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where the graph is disconnected. Specifically, the `func_1` function is designed to check the consistency of the signs for a single component starting from a given vertex `u`. However, the main function `func_2` does not ensure that all components of the graph are checked. If the graph has multiple disconnected components, `func_2` will only check one component and potentially miss others. This means that if there are multiple components that need to be consistent according to the problem description, the program may not detect inconsistencies across these components.

For example, consider a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges as follows:
- Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 with love (1, 2, 1).
- Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 3 with love (2, 3, 1).
- Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 4 with hate (3, 4, 0).
- Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 1 with hate (4, 1, 0).

In this case, the graph is disconnected into two components: {1, 2, 3} and {4}. According to the problem description, the program should consider all components. However, the current implementation will only check the first component {1, 2, 3} and may miss the inconsistency in the second component {4}, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
