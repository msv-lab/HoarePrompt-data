Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The program attempts to solve the problem using a graph coloring approach, where each node is colored either +1 or -1 to represent love or hate. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Graph Construction**: The program constructs the graph and processes nodes using `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not handle the case where the graph is not bipartite correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that a valid solution requires that all triangles are either happy (one love, two hate) or all love.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to check if a node can be colored such that all its neighbors satisfy the required conditions. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not properly ensure that all triangles are handled correctly. For example, it does not correctly propagate the colors through the graph and does not check all possible colorings for each node.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the graph cannot be colored in a way that satisfies the conditions. For instance, if there is a subgraph that cannot be colored without violating the conditions, the program should return 0, but it does not do this correctly.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 0
4 1 0
```
This input describes a cycle of 4 nodes where the first three edges indicate love and the last edge indicates hate. According to the problem description, the only valid solution is to make nodes 1 and 3 love each other and nodes 2 and 4 hate each other. However, the program does not correctly identify this solution and returns 1 instead of 0.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution for all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
