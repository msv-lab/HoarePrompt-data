Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to propagate the signs (love/hate) from a given node `u` to its neighbors based on the current values in the `vis` array.
   - However, the logic within `func_1` does not ensure that the resulting configuration satisfies the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not check whether the resulting configuration is consistent across all triangles (three characters). For instance, it should ensure that for any three characters A, B, and C, either exactly one pair is in love and the other pair is in hate, or all three pairs are in love.
   - The function returns `True` as soon as it completes without finding any inconsistencies, even though the returned configuration might still violate the required conditions for some triangles.

2. **Handling of Consistency Across All Triangles**:
   - The problem requires checking consistency across all possible triangles in the graph. The current implementation only checks for consistency starting from a single node `u`. It does not ensure that the entire graph adheres to the specified conditions for all triangles.
   - The function `func_1` should be recursive and ensure that the entire graph is checked for consistency, but the current implementation only checks the immediate neighborhood of a node.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to fill in the remaining relationships based on the consistency check performed by `func_1`. However, `func_1` does not guarantee that the graph is consistent for all triangles, leading to potential overcounting or undercounting of valid configurations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly verify the consistency of the graph for all possible triangles, which is a critical requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
