You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are many anime that are about "love triangles": Alice loves Bob, and Charlie loves Bob as well, but Alice hates Charlie. You are thinking about an anime which has n characters. The characters are labeled from 1 to n. Every pair of two characters can either mutually love each other or mutually hate each other (there is no neutral state).

You hate love triangles (A-B are in love and B-C are in love, but A-C hate each other), and you also hate it when nobody is in love. So, considering any three characters, you will be happy if exactly one pair is in love (A and B love each other, and C hates both A and B), or if all three pairs are in love (A loves B, B loves C, C loves A).

You are given a list of m known relationships in the anime. You know for sure that certain pairs love each other, and certain pairs hate each other. You're wondering how many ways you can fill in the remaining relationships so you are happy with every triangle. Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1 000 000 007.

Input

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The next m lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The i-th line will contain three integers ai, bi, ci. If ci is 1, then ai and bi are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, <image>).

Each pair of people will be described no more than once.

Output

Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1 000 000 007.

Note

In the first sample, the four ways are to: 

  * Make everyone love each other 
  * Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). 



In the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
maxn = 100005
mod = 1000000007
e = [[] for i in range(maxn)]
vis = [False for i in range(maxn)]
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains tuples (v, c) representing an edge between vertices i and v with relationship c (True for love, False for hate), and vis is a boolean list of size n initialized to False.
def func_1(u):
    sz = len(e[u])
    ok = True
    for i in range(sz):
        v = e[u][i][0]
        
        c = e[u][i][1]
        
        if vis[v] == False:
            if c == True:
                vis[v] = vis[u]
            else:
                vis[v] = -vis[u]
            ok = func_1(v)
        
        if c == 1 and vis[v] != vis[u]:
            return False
        
        if c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `u`: An integer such that \(1 \leq u \leq n\).
    #- `e`: A list of adjacency lists.
    #- `vis`: A boolean list of size `n` where each vertex `v` reachable from `u` through the edges is marked with a consistent sign (`vis[v]` is either `vis[u]` or `-vis[u]` depending on the path taken).
    #- `sz`: The number of edges connected to vertex `u`.
    #- `ok`: The return value of `func_1(v)` after the last update to `vis[v]`, or `False` if the loop terminates early due to the conditions mentioned.
    #
    #If the loop does not execute, the values remain as in the initial state:
    #- `u`: An integer such that \(1 \leq u \leq n\).
    #- `e`: A list of adjacency lists.
    #- `vis`: A boolean list of size `n` initialized to `False`.
    #- `sz`: The number of edges connected to vertex `u`.
    #- `ok`: `True`.
    return ok
    #The program returns `ok` which is `True` since the loop does not execute and the values remain as in the initial state

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000, e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains pairs [j, c] for all j such that there is an edge between i and j with weight c (0 ≤ c ≤ 1), and vis is a boolean list of length n initialized to False.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
