Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1(u)` performs a DFS to check the consistency of the signs (love/hate) among the vertices. However, the problem requires ensuring that every triangle in the graph satisfies one of two conditions:

1. Exactly one pair is in love, and the other pair hates each other.
2. All three pairs are in love.

The current implementation of `func_1(u)` does not enforce these specific conditions. Instead, it simply checks for inconsistencies in the signs based on the edges. This means that it does not ensure that the graph is partitioned into subsets where every subset forms a clique (all love) or an anti-clique (all hate) except for one pair that is the opposite. 

For example, consider the following graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges:

- (1, 2, 1) - 1 and 2 love each other
- (2, 3, 1) - 2 and 3 love each other
- (3, 4, 0) - 3 and 4 hate each other
- (4, 1, 0) - 4 and 1 hate each other

According to the problem, the correct configuration would be to have 1 and 3 love each other while 2 and 4 hate each other. However, the current implementation does not enforce this specific configuration and will likely fail to handle such cases correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
