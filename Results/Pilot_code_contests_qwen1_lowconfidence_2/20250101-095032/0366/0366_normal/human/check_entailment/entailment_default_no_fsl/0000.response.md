Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the graph contains a component that cannot satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code assumes that if `func_1(i)` returns `False`, it should reset the count `cnt` to 0 and break out of the loop. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that the entire graph can be filled in such a way that the conditions are met for every triangle.

For example, consider a graph with 4 vertices and the following edges:
```
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 0
4 1 0
```

In this case, the graph forms a cycle where 1 loves 2, 2 loves 3, 3 hates 4, and 4 hates 1. The code would fail to detect that this configuration is impossible to satisfy for the entire graph, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the entire graph can be consistently filled with relationships that meet the conditions. One approach is to check if the entire graph can be colored with two colors (representing love and hate) such that no three vertices form a triangle where exactly one pair is in love. This involves a more comprehensive check of the graph's structure and consistency.
