The function accepts a real number \(x\) and a list of integers \(a\). It calculates the sum \(b\) of \(a[i] - x\) for each element \(a[i]\) in the list \(a\). During this calculation, it keeps track of the maximum (\(mx\)) and minimum (\(mi\)) values of \(b - kx\) for all \(k\) from \(0\) to the length of \(a\). After the loop, it returns the difference between \(mx\) and \(mi\), which represents the range of values that \(b - kx\) can take over all possible \(k\). This function handles edge cases such as when the list \(a\) is empty (though in this case, the function would raise an error due to division by zero in the initial setup, which is not explicitly handled in the given code).
