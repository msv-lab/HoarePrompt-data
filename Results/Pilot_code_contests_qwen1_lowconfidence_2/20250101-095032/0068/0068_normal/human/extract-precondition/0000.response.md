Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the sequence, and mod is a positive integer representing the modulus value for the factorial calculation.** 

However, this precondition does not align with the problem description provided. Based on the problem description, the function `func_9` should not be related to finding the optimal \( x \) for minimizing the weakness of the sequence. Instead, it seems to be calculating factorials modulo some value, which is not directly relevant to the described problem. The function `func_9` should not be part of the solution for the given problem, as it does not contribute to finding the optimal \( x \) for minimizing the sequence's weakness.
