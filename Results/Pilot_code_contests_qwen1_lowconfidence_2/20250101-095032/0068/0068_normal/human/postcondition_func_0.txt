The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object. This map object contains integers that are derived from splitting a string obtained by calling `func_3()`. The string is split by spaces, and each resulting substring is converted to an integer. However, the annotation mentions that the function references `func_3`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact content of the string returned by `func_3()` without its definition. Additionally, there are no explicit error handling mechanisms in place to manage scenarios where `func_3()` might fail to return a valid string or where the string contains non-integer values.
