The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of the variable `ans`. Since no other operations are performed on any variable in this line, the values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value obtained during the iterations, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` and `r` are adjusted such that the interval [l, r] is narrowed down to the smallest possible range where `ans` is the minimum value found, `m1` and `m2` are the midpoints calculated within the final interval, `p` and `q` are the results of `f(m1, a)` and `f(m2, a)` respectively, and `p` and `q` are the last values used to update `ans`. `ans` is printed.**
