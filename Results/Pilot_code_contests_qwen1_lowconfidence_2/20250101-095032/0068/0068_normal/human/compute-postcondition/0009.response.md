The code `x = int(x / 2)` divides the value of `x` by 2 and then rounds it down to the nearest integer. Given the initial state that `x` is `int(x_initial / 2)`, the new value of `x` will be `int(int(x_initial / 2) / 2)`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x_initial`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `x` without this information. But we can represent it in terms of `x_initial`.

Additionally, the initial state mentions that `v` is a list containing its original elements plus the element `int(x % 2)`. Since `x` is now `int(int(x_initial / 2) / 2)`, we need to evaluate `int(int(x_initial / 2) / 2) % 2` to find the new element added to `v`.

Let's denote the new value of `x` as `x_new = int(int(x_initial / 2) / 2)`.

Now, let's calculate `int(x_new % 2)`:

- If `x_initial` is even, `x_new` will be `int(x_initial / 4)`.
- If `x_initial` is odd, `x_new` will be `int((x_initial - 1) / 4)`.

In both cases, `int(x_new % 2)` will be `0` because `x_new` is always an integer and dividing an integer by 2 twice results in an integer that is even (since `x_initial` was originally an integer).

Therefore, the new element added to `v` is `0`.

Output State: **`v` is a list containing its original elements plus the element `0`, `x` is `int(int(x_initial / 2) / 2)`**
