The code `l = max(l, ll)` sets `l` to the maximum of its current value and `ll`. Since `ll` is less than or equal to `r` and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, the new value of `l` will be `max(l, ll)`, which is at least `ll` and no more than `r`.

The output state is: **`l` is max(`l`, `ll`), `r` is >= `l`, `ll` is <= `r`, `rr` is >= `l`**.
