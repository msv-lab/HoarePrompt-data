`h` is decremented by 1. The value of `ans` is determined by the minimum of `p`, `q`, and the previous value of `ans`. The values of `n`, `a`, `m1`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is equal to its previous value minus 1, `ans` is `min(p, q, ans)`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `m1` is `-33,335`, `p` is the result of `f(m1, a)`, `q` is the result of `f(m2, a)`.

Output State: **`h` is equal to its previous value minus 1, `ans` is `min(p, q, ans)`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `m1` is `-33,335`, `p` is the result of `f(m1, a)`, `q` is the result of `f(m2, a)`**
