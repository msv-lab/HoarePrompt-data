The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of \(2^i\) is \(2^1 = 2\). 

- The value of `i` is 1, so `2 ** i` evaluates to `2`.
- The value of `ans` initially is `[1]`. After appending `2`, `ans` becomes `[1, 2]`.

The states of other variables (`x`, `v`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is a list containing one element `[0]`, `ans` is `[1, 2]`, `i` is 1**
