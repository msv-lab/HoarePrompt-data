Postcondition: **`h` is equal to its previous value minus 1; `ans` is the minimum of `p`, `q`, and its previous value; `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`; `a` is the value returned by `func_2()'; `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`; if `p <= q`, then `q` is now `f(m2, a)` and `r` is `m2`; otherwise, `q` is now `f(m2, a)` and `l` is `m1`.**
