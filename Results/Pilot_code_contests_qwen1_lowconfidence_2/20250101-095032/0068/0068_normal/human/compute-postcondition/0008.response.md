`x` is initially set to `int(x_initial / 2)`, and `x_initial` must be at least 2. The code appends `int(x % 2)` to the list `v`. Since `x` is the integer division of `x_initial` by 2, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x_initial` is even or odd. After appending, the last element of `v` will be `int(x % 2)`. 

Since `x` is calculated from `x_initial`, and `x_initial` is not modified, the only thing that changes is the list `v` which gets a new element. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`v` is a list containing its original elements plus the element `int(x % 2)`, `x` is int(x_initial / 2)**
