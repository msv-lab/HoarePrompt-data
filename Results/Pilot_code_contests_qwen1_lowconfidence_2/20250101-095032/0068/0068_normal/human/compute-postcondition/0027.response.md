Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(|a_i| \leq 10,000\), `l` is either -100,005 or -33,335, `r` is either 100,005 or 100,005, `h` is `h - 1`, `ans` is the minimum of `min(p, q, ans)`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `m1` is -33,335, `p` is the result of `f(m1, a)`, `q` is the result of `f(m2, a)`**
