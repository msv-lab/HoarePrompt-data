The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2 ** 0`, which is 1. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to include the value 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `x` is 0
- `v` is a list containing one element `[0]`
- `ans` is `[1, 2]`
- `i` is 0

After executing the code, `ans` becomes `[1, 2, 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is [0], `ans` is [1, 2, 1], `i` is 0**
