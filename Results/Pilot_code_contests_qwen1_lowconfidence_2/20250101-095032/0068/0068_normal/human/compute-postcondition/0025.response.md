Functionality: **The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `x` and converts it to its binary representation. It then constructs a list `ans` containing the powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of '1's in the binary representation of `x`. However, due to an error in the provided annotations, the final state of the program does not accurately reflect the intended behavior. Specifically, the annotations suggest that `v` should contain the binary representation in reverse order and that the loop should execute exactly once, which is incorrect. The actual code computes the binary representation correctly and constructs the list `ans` based on the binary digits. The function always returns a list containing the single element `1`, regardless of the input `x`. This is because the code appends `2 ** i` to `ans` only when `v[i] == 1`, and since `v` contains the binary representation of `x`, the condition `v[i] == 1` is always true for the last bit, leading to `ans` being `[1]`.**

Edge cases to consider:
- If `x` is `0`, the function still returns `[1]` because the binary representation of `0` is `0`, and the loop will not execute, but the final list `ans` will still contain `[1]`.
- For any positive integer `x`, the function will compute its binary representation and construct the list `ans` accordingly, but the final output will always be `[1]`.

Missing functionality:
- The annotations suggest that `v` should be in reverse order and that the loop should execute exactly once, which is not reflected in the actual code. The actual code correctly computes the binary representation and constructs `ans` based on the binary digits.
