The function `func_8` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`. All these parameters are real numbers where `l` and `r` satisfy the condition `l <= r`, and `ll` and `rr` represent a range `[ll, rr]` such that `ll <= rr`.

- In Case_1, the function returns -1.
- In Case_2, the function returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `r` (the minimum of `r` and `rr`) and `l` (the maximum of `l` and `ll`), ensuring that `r` is greater than or equal to `l` and `ll` is less than or equal to `rr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept four real numbers `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr` under the specified conditions, and either return -1 or the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `r` and `l`, adjusted by their respective bounds `rr` and `ll`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`. It returns -1 in one case and the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `r` (minimum of `r` and `rr`) and `l` (maximum of `l` and `ll`), ensuring `r` >= `l` and `ll` <= `rr`.**
