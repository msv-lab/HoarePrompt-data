The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the function definition. Instead, it uses pre-defined variables `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `h`, and `ans` that are presumably defined outside of the function scope. The function does not modify these variables and does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Given the context and the lack of explicit return statement in the provided function definition, we can infer that the function might be performing some operations internally using these variables, but no explicit return value is indicated.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It uses pre-defined variables `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `h`, and `ans` to perform operations internally.**
