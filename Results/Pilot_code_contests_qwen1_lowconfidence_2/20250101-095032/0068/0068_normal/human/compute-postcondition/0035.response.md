The code `r = m2` assigns the value of `m2` to `r`. The previous value of `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`h` is equal to its previous value minus 1; `ans` is the minimum of `p`, `q`, and its previous value; `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`; `a` is the value returned by `func_2()'; `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`; `q` is now `f(m2, a)`; `r` is `m2`**
