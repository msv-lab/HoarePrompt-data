Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `v` is a list containing one element `[0]`, `ans` is `[1]`, `i` is 0, and the length of `v` is at least 1.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if part sets `ans` to `[1]` when `v[i]` equals `1`, and given the precondition ensures `v[i]` cannot be `1`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
