n is an integer representing the length of the sequence, a is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies |ai| â‰¤ 10,000, l is the initial lower bound set to -100,005, r is the initial upper bound set to 100,005, h is the step size initially set to 101, and ans is the initial answer set to a very large positive number (i_m, which is not defined in the given code but can be assumed to be a large positive constant).
