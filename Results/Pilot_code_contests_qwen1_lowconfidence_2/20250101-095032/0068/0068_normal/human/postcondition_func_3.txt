The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer. It then returns the integer input by the user. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function simply waits for the user to provide an integer input and returns it. If the user inputs something other than an integer, the program will continue to prompt the user until a valid integer is entered.
