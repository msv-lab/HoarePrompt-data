The function `func_2` takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It converts a string returned by `func_3()` into a list of integers. The string contains `n` integers separated by spaces, where `n` is an integer in the range `[1, 200,000]` and each integer `ai` is in the range `[-10,000, 10,000]`. The function ensures that the input string is correctly split into individual integers and these integers are converted to their respective integer types. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be handled separately, assuming the annotations are correct.
