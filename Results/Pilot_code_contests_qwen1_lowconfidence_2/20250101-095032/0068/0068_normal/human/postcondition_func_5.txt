The function performs a binary search-like algorithm to find the minimum value of the function `f(m, a)` over the interval `[l, r]`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It uses pre-defined variables `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `h`, and `ans` to perform operations internally. The function initializes `l` to `-100005`, `r` to `100005`, `h` to `101`, and `ans` to a large positive constant `i_m`. It then iteratively narrows down the interval `[l, r]` by calculating two midpoints `m1` and `m2` and evaluating `f(m1, a)` and `f(m2, a)`. Based on the comparison of these evaluations, it updates the interval and continues the process until `h` becomes zero. The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum value of `f(m, a)` found within the narrowed interval.
