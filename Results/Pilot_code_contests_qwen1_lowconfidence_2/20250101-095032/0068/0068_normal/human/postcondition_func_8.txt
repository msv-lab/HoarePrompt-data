The function `func_8` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`, which are all real numbers. It returns either `-1` or the maximum value between `0` and the difference between `r` (which is the minimum of `r` and `rr`) and `l` (which is the maximum of `l` and `ll`). The function ensures that `r` is greater than or equal to `l` and `ll` is less than or equal to `rr`. If the condition `(ll > r or rr < l)` is true, the function immediately returns `-1`. Otherwise, it adjusts `l` and `r` accordingly before returning the computed value. This function handles edge cases where the initial ranges defined by `l` and `r` do not overlap with `[ll, rr]`, in which case it returns `-1`, and where the ranges do overlap, in which case it computes and returns the valid difference between the adjusted `r` and `l` values.
