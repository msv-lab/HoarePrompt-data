The code `zeros += mn0` increments the value of `zeros` by the value of `mn0`. From the initial state, `mn0` is 0. Therefore, `zeros` will also be incremented by 0.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is 0, `countsa[0]` is 2, `countsb[0]` is 0, `mn0` is 0, `zeros` is 0, `mxZString`, `j9`, and `mn9s[j]` remain unchanged, `countsb[j9]` is 0.**
