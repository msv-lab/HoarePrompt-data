The code `pair9s[i] = 9 - i` updates the dictionary `pair9s` by setting the key `i` to the value `9 - i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `pair9s` is an empty dictionary, we can proceed as follows:

1. Initially, `i` is 0.
2. The dictionary `pair9s` is empty.
3. The code sets `pair9s[0]` to `9 - 0`, which is 9.

After executing the code, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but the dictionary `pair9s` has been updated.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `pair9s` is {0: 9}**
