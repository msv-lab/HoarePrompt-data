`mxZeros` is assigned the value of `zeros`. According to the initial state, `zeros` is the sum of all valid `mni10` values (if `mni10 > 0`). The value of `mxZeros` is now updated to this sum, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `mxZeros` is the sum of all valid `mni10` values (if `mni10 > 0`), `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is the sum of all valid `mni10` values (if `mni10 > 0`), `mn0` is 0, and `countsb[0]` is 0.**
