The code updates the dictionary `pair9s` by setting the value at key `i` to `9 - i`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value at key `1` in `pair9s` will be set to `9 - 1`, which is `8`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated dictionary `pair9s` will have the following entries:
- Key `0`: Value `9`
- Key `1`: Value `8`

The output state is: **`i` is 1; `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8}`.
