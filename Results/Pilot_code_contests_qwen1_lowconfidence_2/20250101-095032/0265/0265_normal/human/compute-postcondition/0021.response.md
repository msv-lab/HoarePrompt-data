The variable `zeros` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `zeros` but does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `pair9s` is `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}`, `baseCounts` is an array of 10 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index in the `digits` list, `iTen` is -1, `mxZeros` is 0, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `zeros` is 0.**
