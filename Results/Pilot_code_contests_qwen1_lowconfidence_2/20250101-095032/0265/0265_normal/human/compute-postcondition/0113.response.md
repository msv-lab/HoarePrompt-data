`zeros` is incremented by `mn`. The value of `mn` is `1`, so `zeros` becomes `1` more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is 1, `zeros` is `countsa[2] - (val - 1) + 1`, `countsa[2]` is `countsa[2] - (val - 1)`, `countsb[8]` is `val - 1`, `mxZString` and `j9` remain unchanged, `mn9s[j]` is `val - 1` for each `j` in [0, 9], `countsb[j9]` is 0**
