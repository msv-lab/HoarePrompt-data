Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `countsb[1]` is decremented by 1, `countsa` remains unchanged, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is 1, `j9` is assigned the value of `pair9s[j]`, `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and the current value of `countsb[j9]`, and the current value of `mn` is greater than 0**
