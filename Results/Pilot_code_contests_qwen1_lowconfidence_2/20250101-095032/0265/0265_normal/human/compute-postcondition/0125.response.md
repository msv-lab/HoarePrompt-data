Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is either greater than 0 or 0, `countsa[2]` and `countsb[8]` are updated based on the value of `mni10`, `zeros` is the total number of elements that were decremented from both `countsa` and `countsb`, `mxZString` and `j9` remain unchanged, `mn9s[j]` is 0 for all `j` in the range [0, 9], `countsb[j9]` is 0 for the specific `j` used in the code. If `mni10 > 0`, `mni10` is 0 after the if block executes.***
