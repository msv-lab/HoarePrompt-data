Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is 1, `zeros` is `countsa[2] - (val - 1) + 1`, `countsa[2]` is `countsa[2] - (val - 1)`, `countsb[8]` is `val - 1`, `mxZString` and `j9` remain unchanged, `mn9s[j]` is `countsa[2] - (val - 1) + 1` for each `j` in [0, 9], `countsb[j9]` is 0. This holds if `mn > 0`. If `mn <= 0`, the postcondition remains as `countsa[2]` is `countsa[2] - min(countsa[8], countsb[8])`, `countsb[8]` is `countsb[8] - 1`, and `mn9s[j]` is `min(countsa[8], countsb[8])` for each `j` in the range [0, 9].***
