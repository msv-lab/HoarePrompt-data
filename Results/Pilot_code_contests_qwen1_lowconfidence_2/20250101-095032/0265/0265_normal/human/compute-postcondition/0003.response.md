According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and it must still be less than 10.

The state of `pair9s` does not change based on the loop condition, so it remains as `{0: 9}`.

State: **`i` is 1, `pair9s` is {0: 9}**
