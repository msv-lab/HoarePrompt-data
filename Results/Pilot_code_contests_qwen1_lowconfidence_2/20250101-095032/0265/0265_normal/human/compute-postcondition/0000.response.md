The code initializes an empty dictionary called `pair9s`. No changes are made to the existing variables, so the only impact is the creation of this new dictionary.

Output State: **`digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105; `pair9s` is an empty dictionary {}**
