Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is `1 + 3*mn` if `mn > 0` or `1 + 2*mn` if `mn <= 0`, `j` is 3, `j9` is `pair9s[3]`, `countsa[3]` is decreased by `mn` if `mn > 0`, `mn9s[2]` is `mn` if `mn > 0`, `mn9s[3]` is `mn`, and all other variables retain their initial values.***
