Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is either `1 + mn` or `1 + 2*mn` depending on whether `mn > 0` or not, `j` is 2, `countsa[2]` is either `X - mn` or `X - 2*mn` depending on whether `mn > 0` or not, `mn9s[2]` is `mn` if `mn > 0`, and all other variables retain their initial values.***
