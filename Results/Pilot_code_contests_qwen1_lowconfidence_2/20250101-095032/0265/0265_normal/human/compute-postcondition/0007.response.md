Output State: **`i` is 10; `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(10)`, which means it will run exactly 10 times.
- Initially, `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- After each iteration, the dictionary `pair9s` is updated such that the key `i` is set to the value `9 - i`.

Let's break down the process:
1. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9}`.
2. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8}`.
3. After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7}`.
4. After the fourth iteration (`i = 3`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6}`.
5. After the fifth iteration (`i = 4`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5}`.
6. After the sixth iteration (`i = 5`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4}`.
7. After the seventh iteration (`i = 6`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3}`.
8. After the eighth iteration (`i = 7`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2}`.
9. After the ninth iteration (`i = 8`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1}`.
10. After the tenth iteration (`i = 9`), `pair9s` becomes `{0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}`.

Since the loop runs exactly 10 times, `i` will be 10 after the last iteration. Therefore, the final state is `i` is 10 and `pair9s` contains all the values from 0 to 9 with the appropriate mappings.
