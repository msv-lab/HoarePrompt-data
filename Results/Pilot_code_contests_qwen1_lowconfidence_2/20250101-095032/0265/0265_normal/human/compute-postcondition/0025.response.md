The given code simply prints the current values of the variables `i`, `countsa`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, and `mni10`. It does not modify any of these variables. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsa` is an array of 10 elements where each element is incremented by the count of its index in the `digits` list, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is 0**
