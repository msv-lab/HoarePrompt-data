The code `zeros += mn0` increments the value of `zeros` by the value of `mn0`. According to the initial state, `mn0` is 0. Therefore, the value of `zeros` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is the sum of all valid `mni10` values (if `mni10 > 0`), `mn0` is 0, and `countsb[0]` is 0.**
