The code `countsa[j] -= mn` updates `countsa[j]` by subtracting `mn` from its current value. Given that `j` is now 2, `countsa[2]` is updated to `X - mn - mn`, which simplifies to `X - 2*mn`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state provided.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is `1 + mn`, `j` is 2, `countsa[2]` is `X - 2*mn`, `countsb[j9]` is updated to `countsb[j9] - mn`.**
