Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8}.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(10)`, meaning `i` will iterate from 0 to 9.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1, and the dictionary `pair9s` had the values {0: 9, 1: 8}.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0 in `range(10)`).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The loop body will update the dictionary `pair9s` by setting the value at key `2` to `9 - 2`, which is `7`.

5. **Updated Dictionary**:
   - After the next iteration, the dictionary `pair9s` will have the following entries:
     - Key `0`: Value `9`
     - Key `1`: Value `8`
     - Key `2`: Value `7`

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `pair9s` will be {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7}.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
**`i` is 2; `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7}`.
