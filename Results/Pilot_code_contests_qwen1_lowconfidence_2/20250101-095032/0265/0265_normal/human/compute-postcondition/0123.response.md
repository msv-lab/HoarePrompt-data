Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is 1, `zeros` is `countsa[2] - (val - 1) + 1`, `countsa[2]` is `countsa[2] - (val - 1)`, `countsb[8]` is 7, `mxZString` and `j9` remain unchanged, `mn9s[j]` is 0 for the specific `j` used in the code, `countsb[j9]` is 7, `j9` is `pair9s[j]` for the specific `j` used in the code, `mn` is 0, `countsa[j]` remains unchanged for all `j`. This is because the if condition `mn > 0` is never satisfied, hence the else part does not execute, and the state of the variables remains as per the precondition.***
