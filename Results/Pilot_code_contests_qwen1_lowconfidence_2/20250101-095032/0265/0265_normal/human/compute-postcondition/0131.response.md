`mxZeros` is assigned the value of `zeros`. The value of `zeros` is greater than `mxZeros`, so after assignment, `mxZeros` will be equal to `zeros`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is 0, `countsa[0]` is 2, `countsb[0]` is 0, `mn0` is 0, `mxZeros` is equal to `zeros`, `mxZString`, `j9`, and `mn9s[j]` remain unchanged, `countsb[j9]` is 0.**
