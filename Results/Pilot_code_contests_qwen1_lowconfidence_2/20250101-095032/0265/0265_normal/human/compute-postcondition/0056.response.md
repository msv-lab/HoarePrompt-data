Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `countsa` is a list where each element is either decremented by the corresponding valid `mni10` value (if `mni10 > 0`) or incremented by the count of its index in the `digits` list, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` and is either decremented by the corresponding valid `mni10` value (if `mni10 > 0`) or remains unchanged, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, and `zeros` is the sum of all valid `mni10` values (if `mni10 > 0`).**
