Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is either `1 + mn` or `1 + 2*mn` depending on whether `mn > 0` or not, `j` is 3, `j9` is `pair9s[3]`, `countsa[2]` is either `X - mn` or `X - 2*mn` depending on whether `mn > 0` or not, `mn9s[2]` is `mn` if `mn > 0`, `mn` is the minimum between `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]`, all other variables retain their initial values.**
