The code `countsb[j9] -= mn` decrements the value of `countsb[j9]` by the value of `mn`. From the initial state, we know that `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j]` for each `j` in the range [0, 9], and `mn` is greater than 0. Since `j9` is a specific index, `countsb[j9]` will be decreased by `mn`.

Given that `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[j9]` and `countsb[j9]`, and since `mn` is greater than 0, `countsb[j9]` will be updated to `countsb[j9] - mn`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is the minimum of 1, `countsa[2]` is `countsa[2] - mn`, `countsb[8]` is decreased by 1, `mxZString` and `j9` remain unchanged, `mn` is the minimum of `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j]` for each `j` in the range [0, 9], and `countsb[j9]` is decreased by `mn`.**
