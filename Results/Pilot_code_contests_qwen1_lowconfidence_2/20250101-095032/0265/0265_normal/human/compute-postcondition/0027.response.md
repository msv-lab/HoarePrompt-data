The code `countsa[i] -= 1` decrements the value at index `i` in the `countsa` array by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value at `countsa[1]` will be decreased by 1.

Since `countsa` is initialized such that each element is incremented by the count of its index in the `digits` list, let's denote the initial value of `countsa` as follows (assuming `digits` is a list of length 10):
- `countsa[0] = digits[0]`
- `countsa[1] = digits[1]`
- ...
- `countsa[9] = digits[9]`

Given that `i` is 1, the value at `countsa[1]` will be decreased by 1. Since the exact values of `digits` are not provided, we can represent the updated value of `countsa[1]` as `digits[1] - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsa` is an array where each element is incremented by the count of its index in the `digits` list except `countsa[1]` which is now `digits[1] - 1`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0**
