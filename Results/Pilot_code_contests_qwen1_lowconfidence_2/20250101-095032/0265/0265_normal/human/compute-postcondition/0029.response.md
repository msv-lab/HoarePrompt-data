The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `zeros`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `countsb[1]`, `countsa`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, or `mni10`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `zeros`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsb[1]` is decremented by 1, `countsa` remains unchanged, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is 1**
