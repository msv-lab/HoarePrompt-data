Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `i10` is 8, `mni10` is 1, `countsa[2]` is `countsa[2] - mn`, `countsb[8]` is decreased by 1, `mxZString` and `j9` remain unchanged, `mn9s[j]` is `mn` for each `j` in the range [0, 9]. Here, `mn` is the value from the if part where it is checked whether `mn > 0`. If the condition is true, `countsa[2]` is updated accordingly and `countsb[8]` is decreased by 1. If the condition is false, no changes occur as there is no else part provided.***
