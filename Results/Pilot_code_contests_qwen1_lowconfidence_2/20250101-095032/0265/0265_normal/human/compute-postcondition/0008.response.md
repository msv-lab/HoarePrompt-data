The code initializes a list `baseCounts` with 10 zeros using the list multiplication operator `[0] * 10`. This operation does not affect the values of `i` or `pair9s`.

Output State: **`i` is 10; `pair9s` is {0: 9, 1: 8, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5, 5: 4, 6: 3, 7: 2, 8: 1, 9: 0}; `baseCounts` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**
