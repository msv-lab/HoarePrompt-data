The value of `zeros` is incremented by `mn`. From the initial state, we know that `zeros` is `1 + mn`. Therefore, after executing `zeros += mn`, the new value of `zeros` is `1 + mn + mn`, which simplifies to `1 + 2*mn`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, `mni10`, `j`, `countsa[2]`, and `countsb[j9]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `mxZeros` is 0, `mni10` is greater than 0, `zeros` is `1 + 2*mn`, `j` is 2, `countsa[2]` is `X - 2*mn`, `countsb[j9]` is updated to `countsb[j9] - mn`**
