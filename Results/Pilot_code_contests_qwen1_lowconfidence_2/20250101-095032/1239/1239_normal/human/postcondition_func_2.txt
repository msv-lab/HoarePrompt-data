The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` from user input. It then returns a tuple containing these two integers `(a, b)`, where each integer is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to \(10^9\). The function does not perform any additional validation or transformation on the input values beyond converting the string input into integers.
