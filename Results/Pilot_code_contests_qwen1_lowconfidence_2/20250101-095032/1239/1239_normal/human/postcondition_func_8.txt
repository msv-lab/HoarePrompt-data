The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of rows), `m` (the number of columns), and `num` (the integer value to fill the list with). It returns a 2D list (an array of arrays) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. This is achieved through a nested list comprehension that initializes each row with `m` elements, all set to `num`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
