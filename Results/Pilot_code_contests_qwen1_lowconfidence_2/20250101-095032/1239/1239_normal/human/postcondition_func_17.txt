The function `func_18()` redirects the standard input (`stdin`) to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output (`stdout`) to write to a file named 'output.txt'. After redirecting these streams, the function does not perform any additional operations on the data within these files. Since the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything, the state of the program after the function concludes will be that `stdin` is redirected to 'input.txt' and `stdout` is redirected to 'output.txt'. There are no actions performed on the content of 'input.txt' or 'output.txt', and the function does not modify any variables or data within these files.
