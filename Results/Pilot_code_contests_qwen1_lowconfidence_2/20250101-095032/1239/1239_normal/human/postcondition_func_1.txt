The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to prompt the user for input and return that input. The function relies on external input, meaning it waits for the user to provide data through the console. There are no specific actions performed on the input other than returning it as is. An edge case to consider is that if the user does not provide any input and simply presses enter, the function will return an empty string. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the user might input non-integer values, which could be important depending on the context of its usage.
