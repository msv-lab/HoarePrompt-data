The function `func_6()` sets up a thread to execute the `main()` function, which processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`. The function increases the recursion limit and thread stack size to handle potentially large inputs. After processing all test cases, the function starts the thread and returns without any explicit output. However, it is implied that the `main()` function returns results for each test case, which are not captured in the return value of `func_6()`. The function does not directly return any value to the caller.
