You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.

Tzuyu gave Sana two integers a and b and a really important quest.

In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x) for any given x, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each testcase, output the smallest possible value of the given expression.

Example

Input


6
6 12
4 9
59 832
28 14
4925 2912
1 1


Output


10
13
891
18
6237
0

Note

For the first test case Sana can choose x=4 and the value will be (6 ⊕ 4) + (12 ⊕ 4) = 2 + 8 = 10. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_19()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no parameters required for this function. It handles the case where the user might input something that cannot be converted to an integer, in which case it will raise a `ValueError`. If the user inputs a valid integer, the function will return that integer. If the user inputs something that is not an integer (e.g., a string or special characters), the function will terminate with an error.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to prompt the user for input and return that input. The function relies on external input, meaning it waits for the user to provide data through the console. There are no specific actions performed on the input other than returning it as is. An edge case to consider is that if the user does not provide any input and simply presses enter, the function will return an empty string. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the user might input non-integer values, which could be important depending on the context of its usage.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` from user input. It then returns a tuple containing these two integers `(a, b)`, where each integer is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to \(10^9\). The function does not perform any additional validation or transformation on the input values beyond converting the string input into integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` within the range [1, 10^9]. The function then converts these integers into strings and returns a list of these string representations. However, the function lacks the necessary loop to iterate over all `t` test cases, meaning it only processes one test case as specified.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. There are no postconditions explicitly stated in the annotated code or the return postconditions that specify the nature of the elements in the list returned by `func_3()`. Therefore, it is unclear what operations `func_3()` performs or what constraints apply to the elements within the returned list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6()` sets up a thread to execute the `main()` function, which processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`. The function increases the recursion limit and thread stack size to handle potentially large inputs. After processing all test cases, the function starts the thread and returns without any explicit output. However, it is implied that the `main()` function returns results for each test case, which are not captured in the return value of `func_6()`. The function does not directly return any value to the caller.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple containing exactly two integers. It returns the second integer from `item`. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special consideration, as the code directly returns `item[1]`, which is the second element of the list or tuple. The function does not modify the input `item` in any way.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` containing exactly two integers, sorts these integers in descending order using the `sorted` function with a custom sorting key (`getKey`), and returns the sorted list. This means that if the input list `l` contains two integers, the function will return a new list where these integers are arranged in descending order. If the input list does not contain exactly two integers, the function's behavior is undefined based on the provided code. The annotation correctly describes the function's intended behavior, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of rows), `m` (the number of columns), and `num` (the integer value to fill the list with). It returns a 2D list (an array of arrays) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. This is achieved through a nested list comprehension that initializes each row with `m` elements, all set to `num`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` as a parameter. It evaluates whether `x` is 0. If `x` is 0, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function uses a bitwise operation to achieve this: `return x and not x & x - 1`. This operation checks if `x` is 0 by leveraging the fact that for any non-zero integer, `x & (x - 1)` results in a non-zero value, thus `not x & x - 1` will be `False`. Therefore, the function correctly returns `True` only when `x` is 0, and `False` otherwise. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the given code.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string and then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. This process ensures that the returned value is a valid binary string representation of the input integer. Potential edge cases include the smallest possible value (1) and the largest possible value (\(10^9\)). The function does not handle cases outside the specified range, and no additional checks or edge cases are mentioned in the provided code.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). It converts the integer into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation, converts each character back into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This means that the function takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its digits. Potential edge cases include the minimum value (1) and maximum value (\(10^9\)), as well as ensuring that the input is indeed an integer within the specified range. The function does not handle cases where the input is outside the specified range, and it assumes that the input is always a valid positive integer.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `r` where \(0 \leq r \leq n\). It returns the value of \(\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\) which is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The function handles the edge case where `r = 0` or `r = n` by simplifying the calculation to `1`, since choosing 0 or all elements is only one way. The function also handles the case where `n - r = 0` by ensuring the denominator includes the factorial of `1` to avoid division by zero.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers with the constraint that `1 ≤ y ≤ x`. It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). Otherwise, it returns `x // y + 1`. This behavior covers all possible cases where `x` and `y` can have values within the specified range. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is an integer representing the base, `y` is an integer representing the exponent, and `p` is a positive integer representing the modulus. It returns `res`, which is the result of \( x^y \mod p \).

The function achieves this by using modular exponentiation, which efficiently computes large powers modulo a number. Specifically, it uses a loop to repeatedly square the base and reduce it modulo `p`, and when the corresponding bit in the exponent `y` is set (i.e., `y & 1`), it multiplies the result by the current value of `x` and reduces the product modulo `p`.

After the loop, the function returns the computed result `res`. This method ensures that the intermediate results do not grow too large, making the computation feasible even for large values of `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If `y` is 0, the function will return 1 because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any `x`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, the result will be 0 because \( 0^y = 0 \) for any positive `y`.
- If `p` is 1, the result will always be 0 because any number modulo 1 is 0.

There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code; it correctly implements the intended operation of modular exponentiation.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the algorithm, the function returns `x` as the GCD and sets `y` to 0. This process covers all potential edge cases where both `x` and `y` are positive integers, and the final state of the program is such that `x` contains the GCD of the original inputs, and `y` is 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False

        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 and returns `False` in several cases:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 3 and not 2 or 3.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3.
4. If any integer `i` between 5 and the square root of `n` (inclusive) divides `n` or `n - 2`.

The function returns `True` in two cases:
1. If `n` is greater than 3, not divisible by 2 or 3, and no integer `i` between 5 and the square root of `n` divides `n` or `n - 2`.
2. If none of the above conditions are met, which defaults to returning `True` for prime numbers greater than 3.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18()` redirects the standard input (`stdin`) to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output (`stdout`) to write to a file named 'output.txt'. After redirecting these streams, the function does not perform any additional operations on the data within these files. Since the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything, the state of the program after the function concludes will be that `stdin` is redirected to 'input.txt' and `stdout` is redirected to 'output.txt'. There are no actions performed on the content of 'input.txt' or 'output.txt', and the function does not modify any variables or data within these files.
Function number 19 :

''' 

 Output hints for function19:  The function `func_19()` iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_1()`. In each iteration, it retrieves two integers `x` and `y` using `func_3()`. It then calculates the bitwise OR (`|`) of these two integers, storing the result in `ans`. If the corresponding bits in `x` and `y` are either both set or both unset, it skips those bits; otherwise, it includes those bits in `ans`. After processing all iterations, the function calls `func_20()` with the final value of `ans`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains the result of the bitwise OR operation applied across all iterations, considering the specified bit conditions.
Function number 20 :
 Code:

''' 

 Output hints for function20:  The function `func_20()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the positional arguments to the file specified by `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, using the separator specified by `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`. The function also ensures that a newline character is written to the file based on the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` and flushes the output buffer if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but it prints the positional arguments to the specified file, potentially altering its contents. If no file is specified, it prints to `sys.stdout`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
