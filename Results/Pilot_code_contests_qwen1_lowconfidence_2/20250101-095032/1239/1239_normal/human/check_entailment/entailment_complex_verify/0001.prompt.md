You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.

Tzuyu gave Sana two integers a and b and a really important quest.

In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x) for any given x, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each testcase, output the smallest possible value of the given expression.

Example

Input


6
6 12
4 9
59 832
28 14
4925 2912
1 1


Output


10
13
891
18
6237
0

Note

For the first test case Sana can choose x=4 and the value will be (6 ⊕ 4) + (12 ⊕ 4) = 2 + 8 = 10. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the smallest possible value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) for any given \(x\). Specifically, the function `func_19` attempts to solve the problem, but it does not implement the optimal solution.

To solve the problem, we need to recognize that the minimum value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) can be achieved by setting \(x\) to be the bitwise XOR of \(a\) and \(b\). This is because:

\[
(a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x) = a \oplus x + b \oplus x = a + b \oplus x \oplus x = a + b \oplus 0 = a + b
\]

However, the provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it uses a brute-force approach to check each bit position from 0 to 31 and tries to construct the minimum value, which is inefficient and does not guarantee correctness for all inputs.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def solve(a, b):
    return a + b - 2 * (a & b)

t = func_1()
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = func_3()
    ans = solve(a, b)
    func_20(ans)
```

This version directly computes the result using the optimal approach and should be used instead of the brute-force method. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_1()` are used in the provided code snippet, and the function does not take any parameters. This suggests that the function reads input from the standard input, but no variables or parameters are specified in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no parameters required for this function. It handles the case where the user might input something that cannot be converted to an integer, in which case it will raise a `ValueError`. If the user inputs a valid integer, the function will return that integer. If the user inputs something that is not an integer (e.g., a string or special characters), the function will terminate with an error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct precondition related to the variables in the provided function `func_2`. However, based on the problem description, we understand that the function should be part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers a and b. The function itself does not use its input arguments and instead relies on external input.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to prompt the user for input and return that input. The function relies on external input, meaning it waits for the user to provide data through the console. There are no specific actions performed on the input other than returning it as is. An edge case to consider is that if the user does not provide any input and simply presses enter, the function will return an empty string. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the user might input non-integer values, which could be important depending on the context of its usage.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two space-separated integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a tuple of two integers (a, b) that are input by the user, each integer between 1 and 10^9, separated by a space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` from user input. It then returns a tuple containing these two integers `(a, b)`, where each integer is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to \(10^9\). The function does not perform any additional validation or transformation on the input values beyond converting the string input into integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a and b are space-separated integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #`The program returns a list of strings containing the space-separated integers a and b for each test case, converted from their original integer form`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` within the range [1, 10^9]. The function then converts these integers into strings and returns a list of these string representations. However, the function lacks the necessary loop to iterate over all `t` test cases, meaning it only processes one test case as specified.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each element of the input list contains two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_3(), but the exact content of this list is unknown as func_3() is not defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. There are no postconditions explicitly stated in the annotated code or the return postconditions that specify the nature of the elements in the list returned by `func_3()`. Therefore, it is unclear what operations `func_3()` performs or what constraints apply to the elements within the returned list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}. Each test case consists of two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6()` sets up a thread to execute the `main()` function, which processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`. The function increases the recursion limit and thread stack size to handle potentially large inputs. After processing all test cases, the function starts the thread and returns without any explicit output. However, it is implied that the `main()` function returns results for each test case, which are not captured in the return value of `func_6()`. The function does not directly return any value to the caller.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list or tuple containing exactly two integers, where the second integer is the value used to determine the order.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second integer from the list or tuple 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple containing exactly two integers. It returns the second integer from `item`. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special consideration, as the code directly returns `item[1]`, which is the second element of the list or tuple. The function does not modify the input `item` in any way.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers containing exactly two elements, a and b, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list containing two elements, which are the elements of list 'l' sorted in descending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` containing exactly two integers, sorts these integers in descending order using the `sorted` function with a custom sorting key (`getKey`), and returns the sorted list. This means that if the input list `l` contains two integers, the function will return a new list where these integers are arranged in descending order. If the input list does not contain exactly two integers, the function's behavior is undefined based on the provided code. The annotation correctly describes the function's intended behavior, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and num is an integer value to fill the list with.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list (an array of arrays) with 'n' rows and 'm' columns, where each element in the list is equal to 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of rows), `m` (the number of columns), and `num` (the integer value to fill the list with). It returns a 2D list (an array of arrays) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. This is achieved through a nested list comprehension that initializes each row with `m` elements, all set to `num`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns True if x is 0, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` as a parameter. It evaluates whether `x` is 0. If `x` is 0, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function uses a bitwise operation to achieve this: `return x and not x & x - 1`. This operation checks if `x` is 0 by leveraging the fact that for any non-zero integer, `x & (x - 1)` results in a non-zero value, thus `not x & x - 1` will be `False`. Therefore, the function correctly returns `True` only when `x` is 0, and `False` otherwise. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the given code.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns a binary string representation of the integer 'n' without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string and then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. This process ensures that the returned value is a valid binary string representation of the input integer. Potential edge cases include the smallest possible value (1) and the largest possible value (\(10^9\)). The function does not handle cases outside the specified range, and no additional checks or edge cases are mentioned in the provided code.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is a digit from the integer 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). It converts the integer into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation, converts each character back into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This means that the function takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its digits. Potential edge cases include the minimum value (1) and maximum value (\(10^9\)), as well as ensuring that the input is indeed an integer within the specified range. The function does not handle cases where the input is outside the specified range, and it assumes that the input is always a valid positive integer.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
    #`The program returns the factorial of n divided by the product of the factorial of r and the factorial of the maximum value between n - r and 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `r` where \(0 \leq r \leq n\). It returns the value of \(\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\) which is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The function handles the edge case where `r = 0` or `r = n` by simplifying the calculation to `1`, since choosing 0 or all elements is only one way. The function also handles the case where `n - r = 0` by ensuring the denominator includes the factorial of `1` to avoid division by zero.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, with 1 ≤ y ≤ x.
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns x divided by y, given that x % y is 0
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #`The program returns x // y + 1, where x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer with 1 ≤ y ≤ x, and x is not divisible by y`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers with the constraint that `1 ≤ y ≤ x`. It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). Otherwise, it returns `x // y + 1`. This behavior covers all possible cases where `x` and `y` can have values within the specified range. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the base, y is an integer representing the exponent, and p is a positive integer representing the modulus. However, this function does not directly relate to the problem of finding the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x). The provided function is for computing modular exponentiation.
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res` is the result of \( x_{initial}^{y_{initial}} \mod p \), `x` is \( x_{initial}^{2^k} \mod p \) where \( k \) is the number of times the loop has executed, `y` is 0, and `p` remains unchanged.
    return res
    #`The program returns res which is the result of \( x_{initial}^{y_{initial}} \mod p \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is an integer representing the base, `y` is an integer representing the exponent, and `p` is a positive integer representing the modulus. It returns `res`, which is the result of \( x^y \mod p \).

The function achieves this by using modular exponentiation, which efficiently computes large powers modulo a number. Specifically, it uses a loop to repeatedly square the base and reduce it modulo `p`, and when the corresponding bit in the exponent `y` is set (i.e., `y & 1`), it multiplies the result by the current value of `x` and reduces the product modulo `p`.

After the loop, the function returns the computed result `res`. This method ensures that the intermediate results do not grow too large, making the computation feasible even for large values of `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If `y` is 0, the function will return 1 because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any `x`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is positive, the result will be 0 because \( 0^y = 0 \) for any positive `y`.
- If `p` is 1, the result will always be 0 because any number modulo 1 is 0.

There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code; it correctly implements the intended operation of modular exponentiation.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the algorithm, the function returns `x` as the GCD and sets `y` to 0. This process covers all potential edge cases where both `x` and `y` are positive integers, and the final state of the program is such that `x` contains the GCD of the original inputs, and `y` is 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than 3, not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, at least 25, and no integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` or `n % (i + 2) == 0`, and `i` is increased by 6 such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) > n`; `i` is the last value updated by the loop
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 and returns `False` in several cases:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 3 and not 2 or 3.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3.
4. If any integer `i` between 5 and the square root of `n` (inclusive) divides `n` or `n - 2`.

The function returns `True` in two cases:
1. If `n` is greater than 3, not divisible by 2 or 3, and no integer `i` between 5 and the square root of `n` divides `n` or `n - 2`.
2. If none of the above conditions are met, which defaults to returning `True` for prime numbers greater than 3.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no variable defined in the provided function `func_18` related to the problem description. The function does not take any parameters and its purpose seems to be redirecting stdin and stdout for reading from 'input.txt' and writing to 'output.txt'. However, based on the problem description and the input/output examples, the precondition should describe the input variables `a` and `b` for each test case.
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18()` redirects the standard input (`stdin`) to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output (`stdout`) to write to a file named 'output.txt'. After redirecting these streams, the function does not perform any additional operations on the data within these files. Since the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything, the state of the program after the function concludes will be that `stdin` is redirected to 'input.txt' and `stdout` is redirected to 'output.txt'. There are no actions performed on the content of 'input.txt' or 'output.txt', and the function does not modify any variables or data within these files.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        x, y = func_3()
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(32):
            if x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i:
                continue
            else:
                ans += 1 << i
        
        func_20(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is \( x \mid y \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19()` iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_1()`. In each iteration, it retrieves two integers `x` and `y` using `func_3()`. It then calculates the bitwise OR (`|`) of these two integers, storing the result in `ans`. If the corresponding bits in `x` and `y` are either both set or both unset, it skips those bits; otherwise, it includes those bits in `ans`. After processing all iterations, the function calls `func_20()` with the final value of `ans`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains the result of the bitwise OR operation applied across all iterations, considering the specified bit conditions.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_20():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stdout` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`; `at_start` is `False`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdout` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, and a newline has been written to `sys.stdout`. The output buffer of `sys.stdout` is flushed if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is called with `flush` set to `True`; otherwise, the output buffer remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the positional arguments to the file specified by `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, using the separator specified by `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`. The function also ensures that a newline character is written to the file based on the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` and flushes the output buffer if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but it prints the positional arguments to the specified file, potentially altering its contents. If no file is specified, it prints to `sys.stdout`.
