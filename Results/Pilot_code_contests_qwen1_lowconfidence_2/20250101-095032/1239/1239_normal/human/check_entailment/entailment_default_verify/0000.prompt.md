You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.

Tzuyu gave Sana two integers a and b and a really important quest.

In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (a ⊕ x) + (b ⊕ x) for any given x, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each testcase, output the smallest possible value of the given expression.

Example

Input


6
6 12
4 9
59 832
28 14
4925 2912
1 1


Output


10
13
891
18
6237
0

Note

For the first test case Sana can choose x=4 and the value will be (6 ⊕ 4) + (12 ⊕ 4) = 2 + 8 = 10. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the smallest possible value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) for any given \(x\). Instead, the program appears to be an attempt to implement a function related to bitwise operations but lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we can observe that \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) simplifies to \(a + b - 2x \oplus (a + b)\). The minimum value of this expression is achieved when \(x\) is set to \(\lfloor \frac{a + b}{2} \rfloor\), which effectively minimizes the XOR part. However, the given code does not contain this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def min_xor_sum(a, b):
    return a + b - (a + b) & -(a + b)

# Testing the function with provided examples
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases = [
        (6, 12),
        (4, 9),
        (59, 832),
        (28, 14),
        (4925, 2912),
        (1, 1)
    ]
    
    for a, b in test_cases:
        result = min_xor_sum(a, b)
        print(result)
```

This corrected function correctly computes the smallest possible value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) by leveraging the properties of XOR and bit manipulation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 20 : The function `func_20()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the positional arguments to the file specified by `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, using the separator specified by `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`. The function also ensures that a newline character is written to the file based on the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` and flushes the output buffer if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but it prints the positional arguments to the specified file, potentially altering its contents. If no file is specified, it prints to `sys.stdout`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
