Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program implements the logic to find the smallest possible value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) for any given \(x\), where \(\oplus\) denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program achieves this:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function `func_3()` reads two space-separated integers for each test case and returns them as a tuple. This is correctly implemented and aligns with the requirement.

2. **Finding the Minimum Value:**
   - For each test case, the program iterates over all possible bits (up to 32 bits, as integers in the given range can have at most 32 bits).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) has the bit set (i.e., if \(x \& (1 << i) \neq 0\)).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) have the bit set or neither has the bit set, the program continues.
   - Otherwise, it increments the answer by \(1 << i\), effectively minimizing the value of \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\).

3. **Outputting the Result:**
   - After determining the minimum value, the program outputs it for each test case.
   - The function `func_20()` is used to print the results, ensuring they are formatted correctly.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- The core logic of the program correctly identifies the optimal \(x\) to minimize \((a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x)\) by considering the differing bits between \(a\) and \(b\).
- The program handles all test cases within the given constraints (up to \(10^4\) test cases, and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)).
- The output is generated in the required format, matching the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
