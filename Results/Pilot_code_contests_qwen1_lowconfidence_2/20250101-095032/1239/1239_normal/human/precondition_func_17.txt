There is no variable defined in the provided function `func_18` related to the problem description. The function does not take any parameters and its purpose seems to be redirecting stdin and stdout for reading from 'input.txt' and writing to 'output.txt'. However, based on the problem description and the input/output examples, the precondition should describe the input variables `a` and `b` for each test case.
