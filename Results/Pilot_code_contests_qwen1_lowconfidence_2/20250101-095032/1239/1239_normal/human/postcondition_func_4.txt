The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. There are no postconditions explicitly stated in the annotated code or the return postconditions that specify the nature of the elements in the list returned by `func_3()`. Therefore, it is unclear what operations `func_3()` performs or what constraints apply to the elements within the returned list.
