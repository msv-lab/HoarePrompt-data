The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). It converts the integer into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation, converts each character back into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This means that the function takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its digits. Potential edge cases include the minimum value (1) and maximum value (\(10^9\)), as well as ensuring that the input is indeed an integer within the specified range. The function does not handle cases where the input is outside the specified range, and it assumes that the input is always a valid positive integer.
