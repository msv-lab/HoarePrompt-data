The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `r` where \(0 \leq r \leq n\). It returns the value of \(\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\) which is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The function handles the edge case where `r = 0` or `r = n` by simplifying the calculation to `1`, since choosing 0 or all elements is only one way. The function also handles the case where `n - r = 0` by ensuring the denominator includes the factorial of `1` to avoid division by zero.
