The code writes the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`. Since `x` is the next element in `args`, and given the precondition, `x` is an integer. Writing `str(x)` to `sys.stdout` does not change the value of `x`, but it does affect the content of `sys.stdout`.

The previous state includes:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `sep` is a single space `' '`.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `x` has been updated to the next element in `args`.
- `at_start` is `False`.

After writing `str(x)` to `sys.stdout`, `x` remains unchanged, but `sys.stdout` now contains the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `x` has been updated to the next element in `args`, and `sys.stdout` contains the string representation of `x`.**
