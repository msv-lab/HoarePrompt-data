The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables and simply continues the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
