According to the code, the loop will execute if the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, and `ans` is 0.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The value of `x` and `y` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
2. The loop will continue to execute as long as the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0.

Since `x` and `y` are both equal to the return value of `func_3()`, and `ans` is 0 (which does not affect the loop condition), the only thing that changes is the loop counter. For the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop will continue if `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0, and `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0**
