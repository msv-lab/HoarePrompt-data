The code `ans += 1 << i` updates the value of `ans` by adding `1 << i` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 0, `1 << i` is `1 << 0`, which is `1`. 

Let's break it down:

- Initially, `ans` is `0`.
- The code increments `ans` by `1 << 0`, which is `1`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, and the conditions involving bitwise operations with `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i)` is False, and `((not x & 1 << i) and (not y & 1 << i))` is False**
