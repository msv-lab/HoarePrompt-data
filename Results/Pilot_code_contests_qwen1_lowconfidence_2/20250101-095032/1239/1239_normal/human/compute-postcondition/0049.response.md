`ans` is incremented by `1 << i`. From the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` was already incremented before this line of code. The value of `ans` is either `0` or `1 << (i + 1)`. Since `1 << i` is equivalent to `2^i`, the new value of `ans` will be the old value of `ans` plus `2^i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `ans` is either `0` or `1 << (i + 1)`

After executing `ans += 1 << i`, the updated value of `ans` will be the old value of `ans` plus `2^i`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is either `0 + 2^i` or `1 << (i + 1) + 2^i`**
