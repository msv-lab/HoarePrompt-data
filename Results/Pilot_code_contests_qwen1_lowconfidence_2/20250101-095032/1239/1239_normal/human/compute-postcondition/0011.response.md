Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`. If `at_start` is `False`, the program continues without appending anything to `sys.stdout`. If `at_start` is `True`, a single space `' '` is appended to `sys.stdout`.***
