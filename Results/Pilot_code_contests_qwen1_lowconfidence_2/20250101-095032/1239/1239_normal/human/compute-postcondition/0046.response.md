Postcondition: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is either `0` or `1 << i`, where `i` is between 0 and 31 (inclusive). If the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)` is true, then `ans` remains `0`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `1 << i`.**
