The code sets `ans` to 0, which overrides the initial value of `ans`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0**
