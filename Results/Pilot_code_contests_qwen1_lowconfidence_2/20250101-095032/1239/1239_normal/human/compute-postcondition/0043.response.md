The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no new assignments or changes are made to the variables `x`, `y`, `ans`, or `i`, the conditions and values remain the same.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is between 0 and 31 (inclusive)
- The condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)` is true

The output state remains the same as the initial state since no variables are updated by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is between 0 and 31 (inclusive), the condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)` is true**
