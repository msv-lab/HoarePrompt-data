The code initializes the variable `at_start` to `True`. However, the code snippet provided does not perform any operations that would affect the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `at_start`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; `sep` is a single space ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True**
