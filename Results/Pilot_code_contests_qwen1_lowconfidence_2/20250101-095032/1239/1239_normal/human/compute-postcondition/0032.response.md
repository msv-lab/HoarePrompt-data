Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is 0 if either `x` or `y` has the bit at position `i` set, and `ans` is 2 if neither `x` nor `y` has the bit at position `i` set.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(32)`, meaning it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 31`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We are currently in the iteration where `i = 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i = 2`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is not dependent on `x`, `y`, or `ans` in terms of changing values, these variables remain the same.
   - The only change needed is to update `i` to `2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `x` remains the return value of `func_3()`.
- `y` remains the return value of `func_3()`.
- `ans` remains 0 if either `x` or `y` has the bit at position `i` set, and 2 if neither `x` nor `y` has the bit at position `i` set.
- `i` changes to 2.

**State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0 if either `x` or `y` has the bit at position `i` set, and `ans` is 2 if neither `x` nor `y` has the bit at position `i` set, `i` is 2**
