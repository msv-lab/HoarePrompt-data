Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdout` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, and a newline has been written to `sys.stdout`. The call to `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is made, but the value of `sys.stdout` remains unchanged unless `flush` is explicitly set to `True`.**
