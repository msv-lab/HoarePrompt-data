`ans` is incremented by `1 << i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `1 << i` equals `1 << 1` which is 2. Therefore, `ans` becomes `0 + 2`, which is 2. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1**
