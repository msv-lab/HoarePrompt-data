Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is the bitwise OR of all bits where either `x` or `y` (but not both) has the bit set.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Operation**: The loop iterates over each bit position from 0 to 31. For each bit position `i`:
   - If the bit at position `i` of `x` is 1 and the bit at position `i` of `y` is 0, or vice versa, the loop continues without modifying `ans`.
   - If the bit at position `i` of both `x` and `y` is 0, the loop continues without modifying `ans`.
   - If the bit at position `i` of both `x` and `y` is 1, the loop continues without modifying `ans`.
   - If the bit at position `i` of either `x` or `y` is 1 (but not both), `ans` is updated to include the bit at position `i`.

2. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the bitwise OR of all positions where the bit is set in either `x` or `y` (but not both).
   - This means that `ans` will have a 1 in each bit position where either `x` or `y` has a 1, but not where both have a 1.

3. **No Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute at all (which would only happen if `x` and `y` are both 0, making every bit comparison false), `ans` remains 0.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the bitwise OR of all bits where either `x` or `y` (but not both) has the bit set.
