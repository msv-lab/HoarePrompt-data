The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, `i`, and `ans`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ans` is either `0` or `1 << (i + 1)` depending on the outcome of the condition.**
