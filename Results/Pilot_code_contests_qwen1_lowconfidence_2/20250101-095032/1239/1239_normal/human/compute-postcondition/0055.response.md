Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations.

### Initial State
- `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `ans` is 0

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(32):
    if x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i:
        continue
    else:
        ans += 1 << i
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition inside the loop is `if x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i or not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i:`.
   - This condition checks if the `i-th` bit is set in both `x` and `y` or if the `i-th` bit is not set in both `x` and `y`.

2. **Behavior of the Loop**:
   - If the condition is true, the loop continues without updating `ans`.
   - If the condition is false, `ans` is updated by adding `1 << i` to it.

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - `x & 1 << i` checks if the `i-th` bit of `x` is set.
   - `y & 1 << i` checks if the `i-th` bit of `y` is set.
   - `1 << i` is a power of 2 corresponding to the `i-th` bit.

4. **Final State Determination**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 31`.
   - For each iteration, if the condition is false, `ans` is incremented by `1 << i`.
   - If the condition is true, `ans` remains unchanged.

5. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - After 32 iterations, `ans` will be the bitwise OR of `x` and `y`.

### Final Output State

- `x` remains equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
- `y` remains equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
- `ans` is the bitwise OR of `x` and `y`.

### Output State
Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is `x | y`.**
