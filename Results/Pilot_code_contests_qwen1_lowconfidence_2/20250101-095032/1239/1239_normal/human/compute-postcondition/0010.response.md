The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a single space `' '` ) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This action does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. It only affects the content written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, and a single space `' '` has been appended to `sys.stdout`.**
