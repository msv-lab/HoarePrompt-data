Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is either `0` or `1 << i`, where `i` is between 0 and 31 (inclusive).
   - The condition `(x & 1 << i and y & 1 << i) or (not x & 1 << i and not y & 1 << i)` is used to determine the value of `ans`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(32):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition checks if both `x` and `y` have the bit at position `i` set (`1 << i`) or both do not have the bit at position `i` set (`0`).
   - If the condition is true, `ans` remains `0`.
   - If the condition is false, `ans` is set to `1 << i`.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one of the values from 0 to 31.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration will check the bit at position `i + 1` for both `x` and `y`.
   - The value of `ans` will be updated based on the outcome of this new condition.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `x` remains the same as it is the return value of `func_3()` and does not change within the loop.
   - `y` remains the same as it is the return value of `func_3()` and does not change within the loop.
   - `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on the new condition for `i + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ans` is either `0` or `1 << (i + 1)` depending on the outcome of the condition.**
