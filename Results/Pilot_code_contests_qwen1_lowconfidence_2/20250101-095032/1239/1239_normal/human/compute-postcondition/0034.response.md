`ans` is initially 0 if either `x` or `y` has the bit at position `i` set, and `ans` is 2 if neither `x` nor `y` has the bit at position `i` set, and `i` is 2. The code `ans += 1 << i` shifts `1` left by `2` positions, which results in `4`. This is added to the current value of `ans`, which is either `0` or `2`.

- If `ans` was `0`, then `ans` becomes `0 + 4 = 4`.
- If `ans` was `2`, then `ans` becomes `2 + 4 = 6`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is `4` if both `x` and `y` do not have the bit at position `2` set, and `ans` is `6` if both `x` and `y` have the bit at position `2` set.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 4 if neither `x` nor `y` has the bit at position 2 set, and `ans` is 6 if both `x` and `y` have the bit at position 2 set.**
