The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the code does not specify which loop the `continue` statement belongs to, but it implies that the loop was in progress. However, since no specific loop or additional context is provided, we consider the impact of `continue` within the context given.

- `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
- `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
- `i` is `i + 2`, which means `i` has been incremented by 2.
- `ans` is either `0`, `1 << (i + 1)`, `0 + 2^i`, or `1 << (i + 1) + 2^i` depending on the outcome of the condition.

Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables directly and simply skips to the next iteration, the values of `x`, `y`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `ans` is either `0`, `1 << (i + 1)`, `0 + 2^i`, or `1 << (i + 1) + 2^i` depending on the outcome of the condition.**
