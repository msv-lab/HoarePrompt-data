`ans` is the bitwise OR of `x` and `y`. The function `func_20(ans)` is called with `ans` as its argument, but no further details about what `func_20` does are provided. Since the function call itself does not assign a new value to any variable and there are no other statements changing the values of `x`, `y`, or `ans`, the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is `x | y`.**
