Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 31`.

3. **What happens in each iteration**:
   - The loop checks if the bit at position `i` of either `x` or `y` (but not both) is 0.
   - If this condition is true, `ans` remains 0.
   - If the condition is false, `ans` is set to 1.

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.
   - Therefore, the current value of `i` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute again with `i = 1`.

6. **States to be Adjusted**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `x` and `y` remain the same as they are determined by the function `func_3()` and do not change within the loop.
   - `ans` remains 0 unless the condition in the loop body is met (which we cannot determine without the actual loop body, but it does not change just by incrementing `i`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
