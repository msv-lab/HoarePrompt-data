The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` pops the values of 'sep' and 'file' from the `kwargs` dictionary with default values if they don't exist. However, since the initial state does not specify any value for `kwargs`, we cannot determine the exact values of `sep` and `file`. But we know that `sep` will be set to the value of `' '` (a single space) unless there is a key `'sep'` in `kwargs` with a different value. Similarly, `file` will be set to `sys.stdout` unless there is a key `'file'` in `kwargs` with a different value.

Since no specific values for `kwargs` are provided, the output state will reflect the default assignments:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; `sep` is a single space ' '; `file` is `sys.stdout`.**
