The code `x, y = func_3()` assigns the return values of `func_3()` to `x` and `y`. Since `func_3()` returns the same value for both `x` and `y`, and the initial state shows that `x` and `y` are both equal to the return value of `func_3()`, this means `x` and `y` will be reassigned to the same value returned by `func_3()`. The initial state also mentions that `ans` is 0, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0**
