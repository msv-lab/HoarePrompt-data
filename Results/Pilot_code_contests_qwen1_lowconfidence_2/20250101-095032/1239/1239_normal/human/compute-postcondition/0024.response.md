The function `func_20` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. However, since the specific operations to be performed on `a` and `b` are not detailed in the given information, the focus is solely on the parameters and basic structure of the function's behavior.
