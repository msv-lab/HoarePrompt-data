The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0 if either `x` or `y` has the bit at position `2` set, and `ans` is 2 if neither `x` nor `y` has the bit at position `2` set, `i` is 2**
