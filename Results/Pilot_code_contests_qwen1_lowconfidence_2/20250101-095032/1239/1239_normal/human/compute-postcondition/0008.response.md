`at_start` is reassigned the boolean value `False`. The value of `t`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, `file`, and the string representation of `x` appended to `sys.stdout` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and a string representation of `x` has been appended to `sys.stdout`.
