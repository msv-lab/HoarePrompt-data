The function `func_20(ans)` is called with the argument `ans`, which is the bitwise OR of all bits where either `x` or `y` (but not both) has the bit set. However, the actual implementation of `func_20()` and `func_3()` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y` after the function call. The only thing we know is that `ans` is calculated based on the initial values of `x` and `y`.

Since `x` and `y` are both equal to the return value of `func_3()`, they have the same value, let's denote this common value as `val`. Therefore, `ans` will be 0 because there is no bit that is set in `x` but not in `y` or vice versa (since `x` and `y` are identical).

The function `func_20(ans)` is called with `ans` being 0, but the return value or any changes made inside `func_20()` are not specified.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is 0**
