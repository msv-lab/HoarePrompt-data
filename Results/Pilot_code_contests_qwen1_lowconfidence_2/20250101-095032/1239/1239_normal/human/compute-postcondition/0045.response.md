The code `ans += 1 << i` increments the value of `ans` by `1 << i`. The value of `1 << i` is a power of 2 where the bit is set at position `i`.

Given the precondition:
- `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` must be between 0 and 31 (inclusive)
- Either `x` does not have the `i`-th bit set and `y` does not have the `i`-th bit set, or `x` has the `i`-th bit set and `y` has the `i`-th bit set

Since `ans` was initially 0, adding `1 << i` will set the `i`-th bit in `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `ans` is `1 << i`, `i` must be between 0 and 31 (inclusive)**
