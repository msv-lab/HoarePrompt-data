The provided code snippet is a comment and does not actually perform any operations on the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only thing this code does is provide a documentation comment about printing values to a stream or the default standard output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
