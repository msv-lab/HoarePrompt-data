Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `ans` is either `0`, `1 << (i + 1)`, `0 + 2^i`, or `1 << (i + 1) + 2^i` depending on the outcome of the condition.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(32)`. This means `i` should be less than 32 for the loop to continue executing.

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 32.
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1, we need to check if `i + 1 < 32`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - If `i + 1` is still less than 32, the loop can execute again.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes `i + 2` (since it was already incremented by 1 in the previous iteration).
   - `x` and `y` remain the same as they were not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` remains the same unless the condition inside the loop changes its value, but since no information about the condition change is given, we assume `ans` stays the same.

5. **Final State:**
   - `x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `i` is `i + 2` (since it was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration and we need to check if it is still less than 32).
   - `ans` is either `0`, `1 << (i + 1)`, `0 + 2^i`, or `1 << (i + 1) + 2^i` depending on the outcome of the condition.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `y` is equal to the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `ans` is either `0`, `1 << (i + 1)`, `0 + 2^i`, or `1 << (i + 1) + 2^i` depending on the outcome of the condition.**
