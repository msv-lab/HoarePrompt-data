Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `sep` is a single space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdout` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, and a newline has been written to `sys.stdout`. The output buffer of `sys.stdout` is flushed if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is called with `flush` set to `True`; otherwise, the output buffer remains unchanged.***
