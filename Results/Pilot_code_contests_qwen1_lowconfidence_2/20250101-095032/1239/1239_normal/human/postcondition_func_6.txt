The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple containing exactly two integers. It returns the second integer from `item`. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special consideration, as the code directly returns `item[1]`, which is the second element of the list or tuple. The function does not modify the input `item` in any way.
