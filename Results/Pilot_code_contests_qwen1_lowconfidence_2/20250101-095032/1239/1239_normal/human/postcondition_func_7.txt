The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` containing exactly two integers, sorts these integers in descending order using the `sorted` function with a custom sorting key (`getKey`), and returns the sorted list. This means that if the input list `l` contains two integers, the function will return a new list where these integers are arranged in descending order. If the input list does not contain exactly two integers, the function's behavior is undefined based on the provided code. The annotation correctly describes the function's intended behavior, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.
