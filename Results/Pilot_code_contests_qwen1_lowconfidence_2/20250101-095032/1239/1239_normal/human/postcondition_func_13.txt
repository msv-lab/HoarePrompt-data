The function `func_14` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers with the constraint that `1 ≤ y ≤ x`. It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). Otherwise, it returns `x // y + 1`. This behavior covers all possible cases where `x` and `y` can have values within the specified range. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
