The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. There are no parameters required for this function. It handles the case where the user might input something that cannot be converted to an integer, in which case it will raise a `ValueError`. If the user inputs a valid integer, the function will return that integer. If the user inputs something that is not an integer (e.g., a string or special characters), the function will terminate with an error.
