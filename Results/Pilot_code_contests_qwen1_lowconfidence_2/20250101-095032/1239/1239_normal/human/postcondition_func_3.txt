The function `func_4()` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` within the range [1, 10^9]. The function then converts these integers into strings and returns a list of these string representations. However, the function lacks the necessary loop to iterate over all `t` test cases, meaning it only processes one test case as specified.
