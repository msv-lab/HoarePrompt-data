You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given an array a_1, …, a_n of n non-negative integers.

Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that a_1 < a_2 < … < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > … > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:

  * The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened; 
  * The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. 



You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.

Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 15\ 000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first and the second test case of the first test, the given array is already sharpened.

In the third test case of the first test, we can transform the array into [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] (decrease the first element 97 times and decrease the last element 4 times). It is sharpened because 3 < 11 < 15 and 15 > 9 > 7 > 4.

In the fourth test case of the first test, it's impossible to make the given array sharpened.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))

#Function 2:
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly determine if an array is sharpened. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively, but they do not account for the specific condition required for an array to be sharpened. Specifically, a sharpened array must have a peak (where the sequence stops increasing and starts decreasing).

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input: `[10, 12, 11, 9]`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (The array can be transformed to `[10, 12, 11, 10]`, which is sharpened.)

However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `No` since neither `func_1` nor `func_2` can identify the presence of a peak.

A correct approach would involve identifying the peak and ensuring that the elements after the peak are in non-increasing order. This requires more complex logic than the current functions provide.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is strictly less than the previous element. The function checks this condition by iterating through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and comparing it with the previous element (index 0). If any element is not less than its preceding element, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list `curr`: In such a case, the function should raise a `ValueError` since the problem statement specifies that the length of `curr` must be between 1 and 3 * 10^5. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, so the function will return `True` for an empty list, which is incorrect.

- A list with a single element: In this case, the function should return `True` because there are no subsequent elements to compare. The current implementation correctly handles this by returning `True` for a single-element list.

- A list with duplicate consecutive elements: The function correctly identifies such a list as not being strictly decreasing and returns `False`.

- A list where the first element is greater than the last element: This scenario would never occur due to the nature of the check, but the function correctly handles it by returning `False` when a non-decreasing sequence is found.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
