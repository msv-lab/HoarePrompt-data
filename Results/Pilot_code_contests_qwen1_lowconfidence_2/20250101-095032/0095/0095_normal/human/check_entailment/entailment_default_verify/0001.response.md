Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly determine if an array is sharpened. These functions only check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, which is not sufficient to identify a sharpened array. A sharpened array has a peak where the sequence stops increasing and starts decreasing. 

The current functions do not identify this peak and ensure that the elements after the peak are in non-increasing order. Therefore, the program cannot correctly determine if an array is sharpened based on the given functions. The output hints confirm that `func_2` does not handle the case of an empty list correctly, further supporting the original assessment.
