Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as described. These functions only check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively, without considering the possibility of transforming the array into a sharpened form through the allowed operations. 

The output hints further confirm this by highlighting that the functions do not handle cases where the array can be transformed into a sharpened form, such as the example `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`, which cannot be determined to be non-sharpened by simply checking for strict monotonicity. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem description.
