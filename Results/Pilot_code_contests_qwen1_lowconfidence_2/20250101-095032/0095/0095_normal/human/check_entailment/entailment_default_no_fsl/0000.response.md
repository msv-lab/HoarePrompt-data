Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which violates the problem description. According to the problem description, the length of the list must be between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\), but the provided code does not check for an empty list and returns `True` in such a case. Additionally, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle an empty list either, leading to potential issues. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
