Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem description correctly. The problem requires checking if it is possible to make the given array sharpened by performing certain operations, not just checking if the array is already sharpened.

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` simply check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively. However, the task is to determine if it's possible to transform the array into a sharpened form by reducing elements.

Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the array `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`. This array is not already sharpened, but it can be transformed into a sharpened array by performing the allowed operations. For instance, we can transform it into `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4]` which is sharpened (increasing up to index 3 and then decreasing).

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` will fail to recognize this possibility. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
