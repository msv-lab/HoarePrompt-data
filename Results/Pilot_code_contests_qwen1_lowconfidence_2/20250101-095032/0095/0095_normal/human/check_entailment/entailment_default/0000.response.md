Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if an array can be made sharpened. Specifically, the logic for checking if an array is already sharpened or can be made sharpened is flawed.

1. **Function `func_1` and `func_2`**: These functions check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively. However, they do not help in determining if an array can be made sharpened. The logic should focus on finding a point `k` where the array transitions from increasing to decreasing, and ensuring that this transition can be achieved by decreasing elements.

2. **Main Logic**: The main part of the code incorrectly attempts to make the array sharpened by decreasing elements. It finds the first index `ind` where the array stops increasing and tries to make the array decrease after that point. However, it does not ensure that the array can be made to decrease properly after the peak, and it does not handle cases where making the array decrease is not possible.

Here is an example where the code fails:
- Consider the array `[10, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The code will attempt to make the array decrease after the first element, but it does not handle the case where the array cannot be made to decrease properly after the peak. The code will incorrectly output "Yes" for this array, even though it is not possible to make the array sharpened by decreasing elements.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if an array can be made sharpened, and there are cases where it fails to produce the correct output.
