You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given an array a_1, …, a_n of n non-negative integers.

Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that a_1 < a_2 < … < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > … > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:

  * The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened; 
  * The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. 



You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.

Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 15\ 000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first and the second test case of the first test, the given array is already sharpened.

In the third test case of the first test, we can transform the array into [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] (decrease the first element 97 times and decrease the last element 4 times). It is sharpened because 3 < 11 < 15 and 15 > 9 > 7 > 4.

In the fourth test case of the first test, it's impossible to make the given array sharpened.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))

#Function 2:
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all((l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem description correctly. The problem requires checking if it is possible to make the given array sharpened by performing certain operations, not just checking if the array is already sharpened.

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` simply check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively. However, the task is to determine if it's possible to transform the array into a sharpened form by reducing elements.

Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the array `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`. This array is not already sharpened, but it can be transformed into a sharpened array by performing the allowed operations. For instance, we can transform it into `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4]` which is sharpened (increasing up to index 3 and then decreasing).

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` will fail to recognize this possibility. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if func_1(l) or func_2(l):
        print('Yes')
        continue
    ind = -1
    mini = 19 ** 10
    maxi = 0
    pr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        maxi = max(maxi, l[i])
        if l[i] < pr:
            ind = i
            break
        pr += 1
    f = 1
    if ind == -1:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    mini = l[ind - 1]
    for i in range(ind, n):
        l[i] = min(l[i], mini - 1)
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        if l[i] < 0 or mini < 0:
            f = 0
    print('Yes' if f else 'No')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers such that 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is in the range 0 to 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the elements in list `curr` are in strictly increasing order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `curr` consisting of non-negative integers where the length of `curr` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\) inclusive, and each element is in the range 0 to \(10^9\) inclusive. After executing, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order. 

The function checks if every element in `curr` is greater than the previous element starting from the second element in the list. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is in strictly increasing order. If any element does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`.

Edge cases:
1. If the list `curr` contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare.
2. If the list `curr` is empty, the function should ideally raise an error or return `True` (depending on the desired behavior), but the provided code does not handle this case. To address this, the function could be modified to check for an empty list and return `True` or raise an error as needed.

Missing functionality:
1. The provided code does not handle the case where `curr` is an empty list. Depending on the intended behavior, this case should be addressed (e.g., returning `True` or raising an error).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers where 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is less than the previous element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is strictly less than the previous element. The function checks this condition by iterating through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and comparing it with the previous element (index 0). If any element is not less than its preceding element, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list `curr`: In such a case, the function should raise a `ValueError` since the problem statement specifies that the length of `curr` must be between 1 and 3 * 10^5. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, so the function will return `True` for an empty list, which is incorrect.

- A list with a single element: In this case, the function should return `True` because there are no subsequent elements to compare. The current implementation correctly handles this by returning `True` for a single-element list.

- A list with duplicate consecutive elements: The function correctly identifies such a list as not being strictly decreasing and returns `False`.

- A list where the first element is greater than the last element: This scenario would never occur due to the nature of the check, but the function correctly handles it by returning `False` when a non-decreasing sequence is found.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
