You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given an array a_1, …, a_n of n non-negative integers.

Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that a_1 < a_2 < … < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > … > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:

  * The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened; 
  * The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. 



You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.

Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 15\ 000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first and the second test case of the first test, the given array is already sharpened.

In the third test case of the first test, we can transform the array into [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] (decrease the first element 97 times and decrease the last element 4 times). It is sharpened because 3 < 11 < 15 and 15 > 9 > 7 > 4.

In the fourth test case of the first test, it's impossible to make the given array sharpened.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if func_1(l) or func_2(l):
        print('Yes')
        continue

    for i in range(n):

        maxi = max(maxi, l[i])

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers such that 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is in the range 0 to 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the elements in list `curr` are in strictly increasing order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `curr` consisting of non-negative integers where the length of `curr` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\) inclusive, and each element is in the range 0 to \(10^9\) inclusive. After executing, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order. 

The function checks if every element in `curr` is greater than the previous element starting from the second element in the list. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is in strictly increasing order. If any element does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`.

Edge cases:
1. If the list `curr` contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare.
2. If the list `curr` is empty, the function should ideally raise an error or return `True` (depending on the desired behavior), but the provided code does not handle this case. To address this, the function could be modified to check for an empty list and return `True` or raise an error as needed.

Missing functionality:
1. The provided code does not handle the case where `curr` is an empty list. Depending on the intended behavior, this case should be addressed (e.g., returning `True` or raising an error).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers where 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is less than the previous element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is strictly less than the previous element. The function checks this condition by iterating through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and comparing it with the previous element (index 0). If any element is not less than its preceding element, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list `curr`: In such a case, the function should raise a `ValueError` since the problem statement specifies that the length of `curr` must be between 1 and 3 * 10^5. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, so the function will return `True` for an empty list, which is incorrect.

- A list with a single element: In this case, the function should return `True` because there are no subsequent elements to compare. The current implementation correctly handles this by returning `True` for a single-element list.

- A list with duplicate consecutive elements: The function correctly identifies such a list as not being strictly decreasing and returns `False`.

- A list where the first element is greater than the last element: This scenario would never occur due to the nature of the check, but the function correctly handles it by returning `False` when a non-decreasing sequence is found.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
