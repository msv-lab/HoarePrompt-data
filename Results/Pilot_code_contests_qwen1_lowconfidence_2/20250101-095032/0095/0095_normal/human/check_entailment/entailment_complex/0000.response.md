Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if an array can be made sharpened. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used correctly to determine if the array can be made sharpened. The code checks if the array is already strictly increasing or strictly decreasing but does not ensure that after performing the operations, the array can be made sharpened.

The key issues are:
1. The code does not correctly use `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if the array can be made sharpened.
2. The code logic for making the array sharpened does not cover all potential cases.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:
Consider the array `[2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8]`. According to the problem description, the goal is to make the array sharpened. The code incorrectly prints "Yes" for this array because it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the array can be made sharpened. The array is not strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, and the code does not correctly adjust the elements to make it sharpened.

To fix this, the code needs to correctly use `func_1` and `func_2` and ensure that after performing the operations, the array can be made sharpened.
