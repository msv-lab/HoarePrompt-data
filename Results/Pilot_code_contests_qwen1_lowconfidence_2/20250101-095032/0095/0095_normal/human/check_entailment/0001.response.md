Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly determine if an array is sharpened. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` check if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively, but they do not account for the specific condition required for an array to be sharpened. Specifically, a sharpened array must have a peak (where the sequence stops increasing and starts decreasing).

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input: `[10, 12, 11, 9]`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (The array can be transformed to `[10, 12, 11, 10]`, which is sharpened.)

However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `No` since neither `func_1` nor `func_2` can identify the presence of a peak.

A correct approach would involve identifying the peak and ensuring that the elements after the peak are in non-increasing order. This requires more complex logic than the current functions provide.
