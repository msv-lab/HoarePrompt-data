The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is strictly less than the previous element. The function checks this condition by iterating through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and comparing it with the previous element (index 0). If any element is not less than its preceding element, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list `curr`: In such a case, the function should raise a `ValueError` since the problem statement specifies that the length of `curr` must be between 1 and 3 * 10^5. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, so the function will return `True` for an empty list, which is incorrect.

- A list with a single element: In this case, the function should return `True` because there are no subsequent elements to compare. The current implementation correctly handles this by returning `True` for a single-element list.

- A list with duplicate consecutive elements: The function correctly identifies such a list as not being strictly decreasing and returns `False`.

- A list where the first element is greater than the last element: This scenario would never occur due to the nature of the check, but the function correctly handles it by returning `False` when a non-decreasing sequence is found.
