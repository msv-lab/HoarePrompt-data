#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers such that 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is in the range 0 to 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the elements in list `curr` are in strictly increasing order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `curr` consisting of non-negative integers where the length of `curr` is between 1 and \(3 \times 10^5\) inclusive, and each element is in the range 0 to \(10^9\) inclusive. After executing, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `curr` are in strictly increasing order. 

The function checks if every element in `curr` is greater than the previous element starting from the second element in the list. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is in strictly increasing order. If any element does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`.

Edge cases:
1. If the list `curr` contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare.
2. If the list `curr` is empty, the function should ideally raise an error or return `True` (depending on the desired behavior), but the provided code does not handle this case. To address this, the function could be modified to check for an empty list and return `True` or raise an error as needed.

Missing functionality:
1. The provided code does not handle the case where `curr` is an empty list. Depending on the intended behavior, this case should be addressed (e.g., returning `True` or raising an error).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers where 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is less than the previous element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `curr` of non-negative integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is strictly less than the previous element. The function checks this condition by iterating through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and comparing it with the previous element (index 0). If any element is not less than its preceding element, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list `curr`: In such a case, the function should raise a `ValueError` since the problem statement specifies that the length of `curr` must be between 1 and 3 * 10^5. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, so the function will return `True` for an empty list, which is incorrect.

- A list with a single element: In this case, the function should return `True` because there are no subsequent elements to compare. The current implementation correctly handles this by returning `True` for a single-element list.

- A list with duplicate consecutive elements: The function correctly identifies such a list as not being strictly decreasing and returns `False`.

- A list where the first element is greater than the last element: This scenario would never occur due to the nature of the check, but the function correctly handles it by returning `False` when a non-decreasing sequence is found.
