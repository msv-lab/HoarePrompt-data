The code `n = len(curr)` calculates the length of the list `curr` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of `curr` is a non-negative integer, and the value of `n` will be equal to this length.

Output State: **`curr` is a list of non-negative integers where 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5 and each element in curr is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive; `n` is the length of `curr`.**
