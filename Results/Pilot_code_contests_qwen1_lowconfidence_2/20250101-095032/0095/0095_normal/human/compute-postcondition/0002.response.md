The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `curr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. The length of `curr` satisfies the condition 1 <= len(curr) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element in `curr` is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in `curr` is less than the previous element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list `curr` of non-negative integers and return a boolean indicating if each element is less than the previous one.
