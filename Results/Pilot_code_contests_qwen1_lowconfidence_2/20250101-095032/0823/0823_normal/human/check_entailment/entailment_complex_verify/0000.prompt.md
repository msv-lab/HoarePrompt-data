You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves long lucky numbers very much. He is interested in the minimum lucky number d that meets some condition. Let cnt(x) be the number of occurrences of number x in number d as a substring. For example, if d = 747747, then cnt(4) = 2, cnt(7) = 4, cnt(47) = 2, cnt(74) = 2. Petya wants the following condition to fulfil simultaneously: cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. Petya is not interested in the occurrences of other numbers. Help him cope with this task.

Input

The single line contains four integers a1, a2, a3 and a4 (1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 106).

Output

On the single line print without leading zeroes the answer to the problem — the minimum lucky number d such, that cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. If such number does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes).

                (tem, four, seven) = (tem2, four2, seven2)
            (ext4, ext7) = ('4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven))

                print('%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:]), ext7))
            else:

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. The program does not handle the case where `a2` (the number of occurrences of '7') is greater than `a1` (the number of occurrences of '4'). This is because the program always appends '4' and '7' alternately, which means it cannot ensure that '7' appears more times than '4' if `a2 > a1`.

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where `a3` (the number of occurrences of '47') is greater than `a4` (the number of occurrences of '74'). The program attempts to balance these counts by appending '4' and '7' alternately, but this may not always result in the minimum lucky number.

For example, consider the input `a1 = 4`, `a2 = 7`, `a3 = 3`, `a4 = 1`. The program will try to generate a number with 4 occurrences of '4', 7 occurrences of '7', 3 occurrences of '47', and 1 occurrence of '74'. However, the program's approach of alternating '4' and '7' does not guarantee the correct minimum lucky number. In this case, the program will print `-1` because it cannot satisfy the conditions simultaneously.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one input case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `tem` is a list containing alternating '4' and '7' based on whether the index `i` is odd or even, `tem2` is a list containing alternating '7' and '4' based on whether the index `i` is odd or even, `four` is the count of times `tem` appends '4', `seven2` is the count of times `tem2` appends '7', `four2` is the count of times `tem` appends '7', and `seven` is the count of times `tem2` appends '4'.
        if ((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1])) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            if ((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3]) :

            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, while `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. If the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true, then either `four` is less than or equal to `a[0]` and `seven2` is less than or equal to `a[1]`, or `four2` is less than or equal to `a[0]` and `seven` is less than or equal to `a[1]`. If the condition is false, no change is made to `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2`.
            ext4, ext7 = '4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven)
            if (tem[-1] == '7') :
                print('%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:]), ext7))
            else :
                print('%s%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:-1]), ext7, tem[-1]))
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. `ext4` is a string of '4's equal to `a[0] - four`, `ext7` is a string of '7's equal to `a[1] - seven`. If the last element of `tem` is '7', then `tem` is updated to `tem[0] + '4' * (a[0] - four) + ''.join(tem[1:]) + '7' * (a[1] - seven)`. Otherwise, `tem` is updated to `tem[0]` followed by a string of '4's of length `length_tem - four`, then a sequence of alternating '4' and '7' from `tem[1:-1]`, followed by a string of '7's of length `a[1] - seven`, and ending with a '4'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity; `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. If `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `tem` is updated according to the specified rules involving `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `a` is a list containing integers read from the input. If the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is greater than 1, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative, and `tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, while `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. The program either prints -1 if `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true, or updates `tem` according to the specified rules involving `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers a2 and a3 from standard input, where 1 ≤ a2, a3 ≤ 10^6, and checks if their absolute difference is greater than 1. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it generates two lists, `tem` and `tem2`, containing alternating '4' and '7', or '7' and '4', depending on the parity of the index. It then counts the occurrences of '4' and '7' in these lists. Based on certain conditions involving another pair of integers a0 and a1 (also read from standard input, 1 ≤ a0, a1 ≤ 10^6), it either updates the `tem` list or prints -1. Finally, it constructs and prints a string using the counts of '4' and '7' and the contents of the `tem` list, ensuring that the total number of '4's and '7's matches a0 and a1, respectively.
