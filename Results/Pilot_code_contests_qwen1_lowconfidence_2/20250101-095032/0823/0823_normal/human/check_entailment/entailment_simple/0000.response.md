Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum lucky number \( d \) such that the counts of substrings match the given conditions. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` Counts:**
   - The program initializes `tem` and `tem2` to alternate '4' and '7', and '7' and '4' respectively. However, it does not ensure that the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` will be exactly `a3` and `a4` respectively.
   - For example, consider the input `2 2 1 1`. The program generates `4774`, which has `cnt(47) = 1` and `cnt(74) = 1`. However, there could be cases where these counts might not align perfectly, especially when `a3` and `a4` are close but not equal.

2. **Mismatched Conditions:**
   - The program checks `if (abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1) : print(-1)`, which is correct in terms of ensuring that the difference between `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` does not exceed 1. However, the logic for generating the final lucky number is flawed.
   - The program attempts to correct the counts by swapping `tem` and `tem2` if certain conditions are met, but this approach does not guarantee that the generated number will meet all the required conditions.

3. **Output Validation:**
   - The program constructs the final lucky number by appending strings of '4's and '7's based on the remaining counts. However, the logic for constructing the final number is not robust enough to ensure that all conditions (`cnt(4) = a1`, `cnt(7) = a2`, `cnt(47) = a3`, `cnt(74) = a4`) are satisfied.
   - For example, consider the input `4 7 3 1`. The program should generate a valid lucky number that meets all the conditions, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to ensure that:
- The counts of '4's and '7's match `a1` and `a2` respectively.
- The counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` match `a3` and `a4` respectively.

A more robust approach would involve:
1. Generating the initial pattern to satisfy the basic counts of '4's and '7's.
2. Adjusting the pattern to ensure the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` match the required values.
3. Ensuring that the generated number is the smallest possible.

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to meet the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
