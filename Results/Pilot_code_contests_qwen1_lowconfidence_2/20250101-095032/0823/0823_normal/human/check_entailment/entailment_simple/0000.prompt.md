You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves long lucky numbers very much. He is interested in the minimum lucky number d that meets some condition. Let cnt(x) be the number of occurrences of number x in number d as a substring. For example, if d = 747747, then cnt(4) = 2, cnt(7) = 4, cnt(47) = 2, cnt(74) = 2. Petya wants the following condition to fulfil simultaneously: cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. Petya is not interested in the occurrences of other numbers. Help him cope with this task.

Input

The single line contains four integers a1, a2, a3 and a4 (1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 106).

Output

On the single line print without leading zeroes the answer to the problem — the minimum lucky number d such, that cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. If such number does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1, a2, a3, and a4 are positive integers such that 1 <= a1, a2, a3, a4 <= 10^6.
def func():
    a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    if (abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        tem, tem2 = ['4'], ['7']
        four, seven = 1, 0
        four2, seven2 = 0, 1
        for i in range(a[2] + a[3]):
            if i & 1:
                tem.append('4')
                tem2.append('7')
                four += 1
                seven2 += 1
            else:
                tem.append('7')
                tem2.append('4')
                four2 += 1
                seven += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `tem` is a list containing alternating '4' and '7' based on whether the index `i` is odd or even, `tem2` is a list containing alternating '7' and '4' based on whether the index `i` is odd or even, `four` is the count of times `tem` appends '4', `seven2` is the count of times `tem2` appends '7', `four2` is the count of times `tem` appends '7', and `seven` is the count of times `tem2` appends '4'.
        if ((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1])) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            if ((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3]) :
                tem, four, seven = tem2, four2, seven2
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, while `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. If the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true, then either `four` is less than or equal to `a[0]` and `seven2` is less than or equal to `a[1]`, or `four2` is less than or equal to `a[0]` and `seven` is less than or equal to `a[1]`. If the condition is false, no change is made to `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2`.
            ext4, ext7 = '4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven)
            if (tem[-1] == '7') :
                print('%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:]), ext7))
            else :
                print('%s%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:-1]), ext7, tem[-1]))
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. `ext4` is a string of '4's equal to `a[0] - four`, `ext7` is a string of '7's equal to `a[1] - seven`. If the last element of `tem` is '7', then `tem` is updated to `tem[0] + '4' * (a[0] - four) + ''.join(tem[1:]) + '7' * (a[1] - seven)`. Otherwise, `tem` is updated to `tem[0]` followed by a string of '4's of length `length_tem - four`, then a sequence of alternating '4' and '7' from `tem[1:-1]`, followed by a string of '7's of length `a[1] - seven`, and ending with a '4'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity; `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. If `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `tem` is updated according to the specified rules involving `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `a` is a list containing integers read from the input. If the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is greater than 1, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative, and `tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, while `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. The program either prints -1 if `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true, or updates `tem` according to the specified rules involving `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
