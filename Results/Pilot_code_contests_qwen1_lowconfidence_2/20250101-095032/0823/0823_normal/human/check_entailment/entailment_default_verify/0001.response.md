Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the program fails to handle cases where the absolute difference between `a2` (the count of '7') and `a1` (the count of '4') is greater than 1. The output hint also confirms that the program checks this condition and prints -1 if the difference is greater than 1. However, the program does not address the specific case where the counts of '47' and '74' do not match perfectly, which can lead to situations where no valid lucky number can be constructed. The example provided (`4 7 3 1`) is a clear counterexample where the program incorrectly outputs -1 instead of finding a valid lucky number.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the program does not fully meet the requirements, hence the original assessment remains correct.
