You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves long lucky numbers very much. He is interested in the minimum lucky number d that meets some condition. Let cnt(x) be the number of occurrences of number x in number d as a substring. For example, if d = 747747, then cnt(4) = 2, cnt(7) = 4, cnt(47) = 2, cnt(74) = 2. Petya wants the following condition to fulfil simultaneously: cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. Petya is not interested in the occurrences of other numbers. Help him cope with this task.

Input

The single line contains four integers a1, a2, a3 and a4 (1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 106).

Output

On the single line print without leading zeroes the answer to the problem — the minimum lucky number d such, that cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. If such number does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes).

def func():
    a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    if abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        (tem, tem2) = (['4'], ['7'])
        (four, seven) = (1, 0)
        (four2, seven2) = (0, 1)
        for i in range(a[2] + a[3]):
            if i & 1:
                tem.append('4')
                tem2.append('7')
                four += 1
                seven2 += 1
            else:
                tem.append('7')
                tem2.append('4')
                four2 += 1
                seven += 1
        if (four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]):
            print(-1)
        else:
            if (four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3]:
                (tem, four, seven) = (tem2, four2, seven2)
            (ext4, ext7) = ('4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven))
            if tem[-1] == '7':
                print('%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:]), ext7))
            else:
                print('%s%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:-1]), ext7, tem[-1]))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. The program does not handle the case where `a2` (the number of occurrences of '7') is greater than `a1` (the number of occurrences of '4'). This is because the program always appends '4' and '7' alternately, which means it cannot ensure that '7' appears more times than '4' if `a2 > a1`.

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where `a3` (the number of occurrences of '47') is greater than `a4` (the number of occurrences of '74'). The program attempts to balance these counts by appending '4' and '7' alternately, but this may not always result in the minimum lucky number.

For example, consider the input `a1 = 4`, `a2 = 7`, `a3 = 3`, `a4 = 1`. The program will try to generate a number with 4 occurrences of '4', 7 occurrences of '7', 3 occurrences of '47', and 1 occurrence of '74'. However, the program's approach of alternating '4' and '7' does not guarantee the correct minimum lucky number. In this case, the program will print `-1` because it cannot satisfy the conditions simultaneously.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one input case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two positive integers a2 and a3 from standard input, where 1 ≤ a2, a3 ≤ 10^6, and checks if their absolute difference is greater than 1. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it generates two lists, `tem` and `tem2`, containing alternating '4' and '7', or '7' and '4', depending on the parity of the index. It then counts the occurrences of '4' and '7' in these lists. Based on certain conditions involving another pair of integers a0 and a1 (also read from standard input, 1 ≤ a0, a1 ≤ 10^6), it either updates the `tem` list or prints -1. Finally, it constructs and prints a string using the counts of '4' and '7' and the contents of the `tem` list, ensuring that the total number of '4's and '7's matches a0 and a1, respectively.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
