Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers \(a1\), \(a2\), \(a3\), and \(a4\) from standard input. These integers represent the required counts of substrings "4", "7", "47", and "74", respectively. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the absolute difference between \(a3\) and \(a4\) is greater than 1. If it is, the program prints "-1" because it is impossible to form a valid lucky number under these conditions. This check ensures the program handles the case where the input does not allow a solution.

3. **Generating Initial Patterns**: The program then generates two initial patterns, `tem` and `tem2`, which contain alternating "4" and "7" characters. The lengths of these patterns are determined by the sum of \(a3\) and \(a4\). This step ensures that both patterns have the required counts of "47" and "74".

4. **Counting Initial Elements**: The program counts the occurrences of "4" and "7" in the generated patterns. It also checks if the counts of "4" and "7" exceed the values of \(a1\) and \(a2\). If they do, the program prints "-1". This step ensures that the generated patterns meet the basic requirements before further adjustments.

5. **Adjusting Patterns**: If the counts do not exceed \(a1\) and \(a2\), the program adjusts the patterns by appending additional "4"s and "7"s as needed to match the exact counts of \(a1\) and \(a2\). This is done by checking the last character of the pattern and constructing the final string accordingly. This ensures that the final string contains exactly the required number of "4"s and "7"s.

6. **Output**: The program constructs and prints the resulting string, which is the minimum lucky number meeting the given conditions. If no such number can be formed, it correctly prints "-1".

Since the program handles all the specified cases and constraints, and correctly generates the minimum lucky number that satisfies the given conditions, the program is correct.
