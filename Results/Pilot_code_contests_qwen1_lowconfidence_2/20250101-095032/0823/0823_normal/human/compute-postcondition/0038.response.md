Postcondition: **`a[2]` and `a[3]` remain the same, `i` is updated to `1`. If `i & 1` is true, then `four` is incremented by 1, `tem` contains `['4']`, `tem2` contains `['7']`, and `seven2` is increased by 1. If `i & 1` is false, then `tem` is `['7']`, `i` is `1`, `tem2` is `['4']`, `four2` is increased by `1`, and `seven` is `2`.**
