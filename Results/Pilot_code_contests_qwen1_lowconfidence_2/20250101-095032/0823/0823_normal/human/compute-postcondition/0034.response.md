The code `tem.append('7')` appends the string '7' to the list `tem`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `tem`, we assume it is an empty list. After appending '7', the list `tem` will contain ['7']. The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tem` is ['7'], `i` is 1**
