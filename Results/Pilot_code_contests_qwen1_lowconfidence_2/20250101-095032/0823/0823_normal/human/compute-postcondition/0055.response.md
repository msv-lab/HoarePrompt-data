Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers a2 and a3 from standard input, where 1 ≤ a2, a3 ≤ 10^6, and checks if their absolute difference is greater than 1. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it generates two lists, `tem` and `tem2`, containing alternating '4' and '7', or '7' and '4', depending on the parity of the index. It then counts the occurrences of '4' and '7' in these lists. Based on certain conditions involving another pair of integers a0 and a1 (also read from standard input, 1 ≤ a0, a1 ≤ 10^6), it either updates the `tem` list or prints -1. Finally, it constructs and prints a string using the counts of '4' and '7' and the contents of the `tem` list, ensuring that the total number of '4's and '7's matches a0 and a1, respectively.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where a2 or a3 is 0. Since the problem statement specifies that a2 and a3 are positive integers, this should not occur in a valid input scenario.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where a0 or a1 is 0. However, given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this is unlikely to be a valid scenario.
- There is no explicit check to ensure that a0 and a1 are within the specified bounds (1 to \(10^6\)). While the code assumes these values are valid, an additional validation check would improve robustness.
