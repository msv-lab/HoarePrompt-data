The code assigns the list `['4']` to the variable `tem` and the list `['7']` to the variable `tem2`. The values of `a`, `tem`, and `tem2` are updated, while the condition about the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, `tem` is ['4'], `tem2` is ['7'], the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is less than or equal to 1**
