The variable `four2` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `four2` is not given, so we cannot determine its exact new value, but we know it has been incremented. The states of the other variables (`tem`, `i`, and `tem2`) are not affected.

Output State: **`tem` is ['7'], `i` is 1, `tem2` is ['4']; `four2` is increased by 1**
