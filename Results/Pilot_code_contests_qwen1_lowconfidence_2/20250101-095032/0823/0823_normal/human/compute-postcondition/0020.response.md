The code appends the string '4' to the list `tem`. Since `tem` was not defined in the initial state, it means that `tem` is a new list being created. The initial state does not provide any information about `tem`, so after appending '4', `tem` contains the string '4'. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `i` is `a[2] + a[3]`; `tem` is a list containing ['4']**
