`tem2` is appended with the value '7', but since `tem2` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be initialized as an empty list before this operation. The values of `a`, `i`, and `tem` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; the index `i` is an integer and is odd; `tem` is a list containing the element `'4'`; `tem2` is an empty list containing the element `'7'`.**
