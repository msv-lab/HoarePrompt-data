Postcondition: **`tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity, `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively, `ext4` is a string of '4's equal to `a[0] - four`, `ext7` is a string of '7's equal to `a[1] - seven`, and the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` remains true, with `tem[-1]` being '4'.**
