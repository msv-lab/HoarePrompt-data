Postcondition: ***`tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. `ext4` is a string of '4's equal to `a[0] - four`, `ext7` is a string of '7's equal to `a[1] - seven`. If the last element of `tem` is '7', then `tem` is updated to `tem[0] + '4' * (a[0] - four) + ''.join(tem[1:]) + '7' * (a[1] - seven)`. Otherwise, `tem` is updated to `tem[0]` followed by a string of '4's of length `length_tem - four`, then a sequence of alternating '4' and '7' from `tem[1:-1]`, followed by a string of '7's of length `a[1] - seven`, and ending with a '4'.***
