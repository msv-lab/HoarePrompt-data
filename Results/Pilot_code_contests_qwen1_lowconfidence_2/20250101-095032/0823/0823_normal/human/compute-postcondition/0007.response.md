Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input.
- `tem` is `['4']`.
- `tem2` is `['7']`.
- `four` is 1.
- `seven` is 0.
- `four2` is 0.
- `seven2` is 1.
- The absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is less than or equal to 1.

### Loop Analysis:
The for loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(a[2] + a[3]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the expression `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative.
2. **Value of `a[2]` and `a[3]`**: Since the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, both `a[2]` and `a[3]` should be integers close to each other (or possibly equal).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Ensure `a[2]` and `a[3]` are Valid Integers**: Both `a[2]` and `a[3]` must be valid integers for the range function to work correctly.
2. **Sum of `a[2]` and `a[3]` Must Be Non-Negative**: For the loop to execute, `a[2] + a[3]` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Given these points, let's adjust the initial states:

- `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, ensuring that `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers.
- The absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is less than or equal to 1.
- Ensure that `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative.**
