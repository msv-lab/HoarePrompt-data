`tem2` is appended with the value `'4'`. Since `tem2` was not mentioned in the initial state, it implies that `tem2` is a new list created and initialized with the value `'4'`. The values of `a`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the original integers plus the string `'7'`, `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers with their absolute difference less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative, the index `i` is not odd, `tem2` is a list containing the element `'4'`**.
