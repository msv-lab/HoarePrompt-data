`four2` and `seven2` are assigned the values `0` and `1`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, `tem` is ['4'], `tem2` is ['7'], `four` is 1, `seven` is 0, `four2` is 0, `seven2` is 1, the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is less than or equal to 1.
