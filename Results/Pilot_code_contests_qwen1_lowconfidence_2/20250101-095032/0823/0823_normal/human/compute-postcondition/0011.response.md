`four` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `tem`, and `tem2` also remain unchanged. The output state is: `a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; the index `i` is an odd integer; `tem` is a list containing the element `'4'`; `tem2` is an empty list containing the element `'7'`; `four` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; the index `i` is an odd integer; `tem` is a list containing the element `'4'`; `tem2` is an empty list containing the element `'7'`; `four` is 1.**
