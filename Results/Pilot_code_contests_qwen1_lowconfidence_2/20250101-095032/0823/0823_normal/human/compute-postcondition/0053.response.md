Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing integers read from the input. If the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is greater than 1, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative, and `tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, while `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. The program either prints -1 if `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true, or updates `tem` according to the specified rules involving `a[0]` and `a[1]`.**
