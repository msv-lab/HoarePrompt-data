`tem2` is appended with the value `'7'`. Since `tem` was initially a list containing `['4']`, appending `'7'` to it changes the list to `['4', '7']`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `i` is `a[2] + a[3]`; `tem` is a list containing ['4'], `tem2` is a list containing ['4', '7']**
