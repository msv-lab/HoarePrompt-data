Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `tem` is a list containing alternating '4' and '7' based on whether the index `i` is odd or even, `tem2` is a list containing alternating '7' and '4' based on whether the index `i` is odd or even, `four` is the count of times `tem` appends '4', `seven2` is the count of times `tem2` appends '7', `four2` is the count of times `tem` appends '7', and `seven` is the count of times `tem2` appends '4'. The condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true.**
