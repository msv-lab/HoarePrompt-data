Postcondition: ***`a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `i` is `a[2] + a[3]`. If `i` is odd, `tem` is a list containing ['4'], `tem2` is a list containing ['4', '7'], `four` is increased by 1, and `seven2` is increased by 1. If `i` is even, `tem` is a list containing the element `'7'`, `tem2` is a list containing the element `'4'`, `four2` is one more than its previous value, and `seven` is increased by 1.***
