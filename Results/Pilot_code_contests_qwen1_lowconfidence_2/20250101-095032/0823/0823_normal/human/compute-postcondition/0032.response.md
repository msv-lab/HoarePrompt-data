The code `four += 1` increments the value of the variable `four` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify what `four` is, we can assume it is being used as a reference to either `a[2]` or `a[3]` (since these are the only elements in the list that are mentioned as remaining the same). However, since the exact value of `four` is not specified, we can treat it as a separate variable that was initially unspecified and now is incremented by 1.

Other variables are not affected, so they retain their initial states:
- `i` is 1
- `tem` contains `['4']`
- `tem2` contains `['7']`

Output State: **`four` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `tem` contains `['4']`, `tem2` contains `['7']`**
