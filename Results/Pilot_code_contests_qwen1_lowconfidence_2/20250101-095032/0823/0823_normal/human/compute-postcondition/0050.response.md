Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The code prints a formatted string using the `%` operator, which combines various parts from the initial state.
2. The string to be printed is constructed as follows:
   - `tem[0]`: This is the first element of the list `tem`.
   - `ext4`: A string of '4's equal to `a[0] - four`. Here, `a[0]` is the length of `tem` and `four` is the count of '7' in `tem`.
   - `tem[1:-1]`: This is a slice of the list `tem` excluding the first and last elements.
   - `ext7`: A string of '7's equal to `a[1] - seven`. Here, `a[1]` is the length of `tem2` and `seven` is the count of '4' in `tem2`.
   - `tem[-1]`: This is the last element of the list `tem`.

Given the conditions:
- `tem` and `tem2` contain alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity.
- `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively.
- `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively.
- `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` remains true.
- `tem[-1]` is '4'.

Since `tem` alternates between '4' and '7', let's assume `tem` looks like this: `['4', '7', '4', '7', ..., '4']`. If `tem` has an odd number of elements, the last element is '4'. Given `tem[-1]` is '4', the length of `tem` (denoted as `a[0]`) is odd.

Let's denote:
- `length_tem` as the length of `tem` (odd).
- `count_7_in_tem` as `four`.
- `count_4_in_tem2` as `four2`.

Then:
- `ext4` is a string of '4's equal to `a[0] - four` which is `length_tem - four`.
- `ext7` is a string of '7's equal to `a[1] - seven` which is `length_tem2 - seven`.

The string printed will be:
- First element of `tem`: `tem[0]`.
- Followed by `ext4` (a string of '4's).
- Then the middle part of `tem` excluding the first and last elements: `tem[1:-1]`.
- Followed by `ext7` (a string of '7's).
- End with the last element of `tem`: `tem[-1]`.

Given the alternating pattern and the condition `tem[-1]` being '4', the output string will start and end with '4', and the middle part will be alternating '4's and '7's. The exact values of `four` and `seven` are not specified, but we know they affect the lengths of `ext4` and `ext7`.

Since the exact values of `four`, `seven`, and `a[1]` are not given, we can express the output in terms of these values. However, the structure of the output is clear.

Output State: **`tem[0]` is a '4', followed by a string of '4's of length `length_tem - four`, then a sequence of alternating '4' and '7' from `tem[1:-1]`, followed by a string of '7's of length `a[1] - seven`, and ending with a '4'**.

Since `tem[-1]` is '4', the output starts and ends with '4'. The exact number of '4's and '7's depends on the values of `four`, `seven`, and `a[1]`.

For a concrete example, if `tem = ['4', '7', '4', '7', '4']`, `four = 2`, and `seven = 2`, then `ext4 = '44'` and `ext7 = '77'`. The output would be `447474`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`tem[0]` is a '4', followed by a string of '4's of length `length_tem - four`, then a sequence of alternating '4' and '7' from `tem[1:-1]`, followed by a string of '7's of length `a[1] - seven`, and ending with a '4'**.
