The code appends the string `'7'` to the list `a`. Since `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers and their absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative, these conditions remain valid after the append operation. The index `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the original integers plus the string `'7'`, `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers with their absolute difference less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative, the index `i` is not odd.**
