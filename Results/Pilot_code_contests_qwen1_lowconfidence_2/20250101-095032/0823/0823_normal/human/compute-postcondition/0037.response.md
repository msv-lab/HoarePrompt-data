`seven` is assigned the value of `1` because `tem` is `['7']` and the first element of `tem` is `'7'`. The value of `seven` is incremented by 1, so `seven` becomes `2`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tem` is `['7']`, `i` is `1`, `tem2` is `['4']`, `four2` is increased by `1`, and `seven` is `2`.

Output State: **`tem` is `['7']`, `i` is `1`, `tem2` is `['4']`, `four2` is increased by `1`, `seven` is `2`**
