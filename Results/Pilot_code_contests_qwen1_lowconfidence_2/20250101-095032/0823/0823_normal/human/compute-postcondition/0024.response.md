The code `tem.append('7')` appends the string `'7'` to the list `tem`. Since `tem` was not initially defined in the given initial state, it means `tem` is created as an empty list before appending `'7'`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged because the code does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `i` is `a[2] + a[3]`; `tem` is a list containing the element `'7'`**
