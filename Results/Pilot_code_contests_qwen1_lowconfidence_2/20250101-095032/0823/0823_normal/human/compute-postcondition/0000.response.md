The code `a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are no longer positive integers in the range `[1, 10^6]` because they have been replaced by the values read from the input. The new list `a` contains these integer values.

Since the exact values of the input are not specified, the output state will reflect the new list `a` containing four integers, which were previously `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4`.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are no longer defined**
