The code appends the string `'7'` to the list `tem2`. Initially, `tem` contains the list `['4']`. Since no changes are made to `a[2]`, `a[3]`, or `i`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `tem2` is `['7']`.

Output State: **`a[2]` remains the same, `a[3]` remains the same, `i` is 1, `tem` contains `['4']`, `tem2` contains `['7']`**
