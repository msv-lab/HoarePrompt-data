Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; if the index `i` is an odd integer, `tem` is a list containing the element `'4'`, `tem2` is an empty list containing the element `'7'`, `four` is 1, and `seven2` is an integer that has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` contains the original integers plus the string '7', `tem2` is a list containing the element '4', `four2` is 1, and `seven` is 1.**
