`tem` is appended with the value `'4'`. Since `tem` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new list or an empty list before this operation. The initial state does not provide any information about `tem`, so it is considered as an empty list initially. After appending `'4'` to `tem`, the list `tem` will contain the value `'4'`.

The other variables (`a`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; the index `i` is an integer and is odd; `tem` is a list containing the element `'4'`**
