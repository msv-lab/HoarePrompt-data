The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, or `a4`. However, since `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are no longer defined, they remain undefined. The only information that changes is the printed value.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is greater than 1, and -1 is printed to the console. `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are undefined.**
