`tem2.append('4')` adds the string `'4'` to the list `tem2`. Since `tem2` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `tem2` will contain the element `'4'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers with an absolute difference less than or equal to 1 and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `i` is `a[2] + a[3]`; `tem` is a list containing the element `'7'`; `tem2` is a list containing the element `'4'`**
