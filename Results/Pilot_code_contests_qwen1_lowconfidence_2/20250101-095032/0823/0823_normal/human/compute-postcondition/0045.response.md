Postcondition: ***`tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity. `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, while `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. If the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true, then either `four` is less than or equal to `a[0]` and `seven2` is less than or equal to `a[1]`, or `four2` is less than or equal to `a[0]` and `seven` is less than or equal to `a[1]`. If the condition is false, no change is made to `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2`.***
