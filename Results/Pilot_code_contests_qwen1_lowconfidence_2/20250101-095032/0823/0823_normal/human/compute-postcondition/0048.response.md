Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `print('%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:]), ext7))`

   - `tem[0]` is the first element of the list `tem`.
   - `ext4` is a string of '4's and its length is `a[0] - four`.
   - `tem[1:]` is a sublist of `tem` starting from the second element.
   - `ext7` is a string of '7's and its length is `a[1] - seven`.

   Since the initial state is that `tem` and `tem2` contain alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity, and the last element of `tem` is '7', we know:
   - `tem` is a list like `[char1, '4', '7', '4', '7', ..., '7']`.
   - `ext4` is a string of '4's whose length is `a[0] - four`.
   - `ext7` is a string of '7's whose length is `a[1] - seven`.

   The printed string will be:
   - The first element of `tem` (`tem[0]`).
   - Followed by `ext4`.
   - Followed by the rest of `tem` except the first element (`''.join(tem[1:])`).
   - Followed by `ext7`.

Given that `tem` ends with '7', the printed string will be constructed as follows:
- Start with `tem[0]`.
- Append `ext4` which is a string of '4's.
- Append the rest of `tem` (excluding `tem[0]`).
- Finally, append `ext7` which is a string of '7's.

Since the exact values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `four`, and `seven` are not provided, let's denote them symbolically:
- `tem[0]` could be '4' or '7'.
- `ext4` is a string of '4's of length `a[0] - four`.
- `ext7` is a string of '7's of length `a[1] - seven`.

Therefore, the output string will be:
- `tem[0] + '4' * (a[0] - four) + ''.join(tem[1:]) + '7' * (a[1] - seven)`.

Output State: **`tem[0] + '4' * (a[0] - four) + ''.join(tem[1:]) + '7' * (a[1] - seven)`**
