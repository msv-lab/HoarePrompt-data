Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, where `a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers, the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `a[3]` is less than or equal to 1, and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `tem` and `tem2` are lists containing alternating '4' and '7' or '7' and '4' based on the index parity; `four` and `seven2` are counts of '7' in `tem` and `tem2` respectively, `seven` and `four2` are counts of '4' in `tem2` and `tem` respectively. If `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `tem` is updated according to the specified rules involving `a[0]` and `a[1]`.**
