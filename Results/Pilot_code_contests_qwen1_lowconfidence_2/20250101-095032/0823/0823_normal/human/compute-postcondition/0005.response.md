The code assigns the value 1 to `four` and 0 to `seven`. The variables `a`, `tem`, and `tem2` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of these variables, but the new assignments are noted.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing the integers read from the input, `tem` is ['4'], `tem2` is ['7'], `four` is 1, `seven` is 0, the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `a` is less than or equal to 1**
