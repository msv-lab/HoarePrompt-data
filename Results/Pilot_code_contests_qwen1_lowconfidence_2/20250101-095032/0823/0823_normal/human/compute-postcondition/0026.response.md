The code increments the variable `four2` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `four2`, we can only say that `four2` is now one more than its previous value. The values of the other variables (`a[2]`, `a[3]`, `i`, `tem`, and `tem2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a[2]` and `a[3]` are valid integers with an absolute difference less than or equal to 1 and `a[2] + a[3]` is non-negative; `i` is `a[2] + a[3]`; `tem` is a list containing the element `'7'`; `tem2` is a list containing the element `'4'`; `four2` is one more than its previous value.**
