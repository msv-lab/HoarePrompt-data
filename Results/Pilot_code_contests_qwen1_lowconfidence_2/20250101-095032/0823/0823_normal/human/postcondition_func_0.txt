The function reads two positive integers a2 and a3 from standard input, where 1 ≤ a2, a3 ≤ 10^6, and checks if their absolute difference is greater than 1. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it generates two lists, `tem` and `tem2`, containing alternating '4' and '7', or '7' and '4', depending on the parity of the index. It then counts the occurrences of '4' and '7' in these lists. Based on certain conditions involving another pair of integers a0 and a1 (also read from standard input, 1 ≤ a0, a1 ≤ 10^6), it either updates the `tem` list or prints -1. Finally, it constructs and prints a string using the counts of '4' and '7' and the contents of the `tem` list, ensuring that the total number of '4's and '7's matches a0 and a1, respectively.
