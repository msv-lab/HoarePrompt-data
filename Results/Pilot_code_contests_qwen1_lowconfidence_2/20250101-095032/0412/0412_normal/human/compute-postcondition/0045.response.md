Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state step by step:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is set to `i_current + 1`
- `j` is set to the first index where `input_list[j][0] - input_list[i_current + 1][0] < d`
- `partial_sum` is set to `input_list[i_current + 1][0]`
- `max_factor` is set to the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`

To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to check if the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` holds true.

Since `i` is set to `i_current + 1` and `j` is determined based on the condition `input_list[j][0] - input_list[i_current + 1][0] < d`, we can infer that:
- The value of `input_list[j][0]` is less than `input_list[i_current + 1][0] + d`

However, this does not directly tell us about the relationship between `input_list[i][0]` and `input_list[j][0]`. For the loop to execute, we need `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` to be greater than or equal to `d`.

Since `i` starts from `i_current + 1`, we can assume `input_list[i][0]` is the next element in the list after `input_list[i_current + 1][0]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `input_list[i][0]` should be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`.

Given the initial setup, we need to ensure that the initial values of `i` and `j` meet this condition. Since `i` starts from `i_current + 1` and `j` is determined such that `input_list[j][0]` is less than `input_list[i_current + 1][0] + d`, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `input_list[i][0]` (which is `input_list[i_current + 1][0]` plus one position) is at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `input_list[i][0]` is at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`.

State: **`i` is set to `i_current + 1`, `j` is set to the first index where `input_list[j][0] - input_list[i_current + 1][0] < d`, `partial_sum` is set to `input_list[i_current + 1][1]`, `max_factor` is set to the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`, and `input_list[i][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`**
