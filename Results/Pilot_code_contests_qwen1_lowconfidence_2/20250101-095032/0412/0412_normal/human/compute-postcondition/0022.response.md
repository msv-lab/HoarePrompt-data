Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `partial_sum` has been updated by subtracting `input_list[j][1]` where `j` is such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.
   - `j` is incremented.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, we need to find the next valid `j` such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1 from the previous iteration, the next `j` should satisfy `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - We need to ensure that `j` is such that the condition `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` holds true.
   - Additionally, `j` should be incremented after each iteration, so we need to make sure `j` is correctly positioned for the next check.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` must be adjusted to find the next valid position that satisfies the loop condition.
   - `partial_sum` will be updated again in the next iteration based on the new `j`.

Therefore, the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` must be such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.
- `partial_sum` will be updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` must be such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`, and `partial_sum` will be updated accordingly.**
