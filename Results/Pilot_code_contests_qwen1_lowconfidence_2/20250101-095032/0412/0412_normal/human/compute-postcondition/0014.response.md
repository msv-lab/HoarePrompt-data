`input_list` is sorted based on the tuples contained within it. Each tuple in `input_list` consists of the first two elements of `user_input`. Since sorting does not change the number of elements or their type, only the order of the tuples within the list changes. 

Therefore, after sorting, `input_list` will contain the same tuples but in a sorted order based on the first two elements of each tuple.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `user_input` is a list of integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`, `input_list` is a list of tuples where each tuple is sorted based on the first two elements of `user_input`**
