Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is incremented to the final index where the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` no longer holds.
   - `j` is incremented to the final index where the condition holds.
   - `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i][1]`.
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.

2. **Current Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `i` (let's call it `i_current`) needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against the upper limit `n-1`.

### Adjusting States

1. **Incrementing `i`:**
   - Since the loop is defined as `range(1, n)`, the next value of `i` should be `i_current + 1`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - We need to ensure that the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` still holds for the new value of `i`.

3. **Resetting `j`:**
   - The value of `j` should be reset to find the new valid `j` that satisfies the condition `input_list[j][0] - input_list[i][0] < d`.

4. **Updating `partial_sum` and `max_factor`:**
   - `partial_sum` should be reset to `input_list[i][1]` since we are starting a new segment from `i`.
   - `max_factor` should be updated to the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.

### Final State

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `i` is set to `i_current + 1`.
- `j` is set to the first index where `input_list[j][0] - input_list[i_current + 1][0] < d`.
- `partial_sum` is set to `input_list[i_current + 1][1]`.
- `max_factor` is set to the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.

### Answer

State: **`i` is set to `i_current + 1`, `j` is set to the first index where `input_list[j][0] - input_list[i_current + 1][0] < d`, `partial_sum` is set to `input_list[i_current + 1][1]`, `max_factor` is set to the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.**
