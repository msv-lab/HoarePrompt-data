The code `print(max_factor)` simply prints the value of `max_factor`. This does not change the value of `max_factor` or any other variable. The value of `max_factor` remains unchanged after this line of code is executed.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is the index where the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] < d` first holds, `partial_sum` is the maximum of its original value and the sum of selected elements from `input_list`, `max_factor` is the maximum value of `partial_sum` after all iterations, and `input_list[i][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]` if `i < n`.**
