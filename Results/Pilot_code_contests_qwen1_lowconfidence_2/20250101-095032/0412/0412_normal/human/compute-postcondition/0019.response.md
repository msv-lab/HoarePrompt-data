Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

2. **Understand the current state**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` itself is not directly involved in the loop condition).

3. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must be true when the loop starts.

4. **Consider the variables involved in the condition**:
   - `i` is fixed at 1.
   - We need to ensure that there exists some `j` such that the condition holds.

5. **Check the current state**:
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1, we need to find a valid `j` such that the condition is satisfied.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - The current state does not provide specific values for `input_list`, but we need to ensure that there exists some `j` where the condition holds.

Given the information, we cannot directly modify the state because we don't have specific values for `input_list`. However, we need to ensure that there exists a `j` such that the condition `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` holds.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that there exists a valid `j` for the condition to hold.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, and there must exist a `j` such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`**
