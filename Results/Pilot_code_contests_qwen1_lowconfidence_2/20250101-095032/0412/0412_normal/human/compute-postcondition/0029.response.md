`partial_sum` is updated by adding `input_list[i][1]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `j` is `j + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `partial_sum` is calculated based on certain conditions involving `input_list`. After executing the line `partial_sum += input_list[i][1]`, `i` is incremented by 1 because the next iteration would start with `i = 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `j + k`, `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1]`**
