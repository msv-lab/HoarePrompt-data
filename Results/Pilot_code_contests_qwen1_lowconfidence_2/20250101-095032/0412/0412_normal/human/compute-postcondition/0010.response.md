According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `read_input` is a list of integers.
- `d` is the second element of `read_input`.
- `user_input` is a list of integers.
- `input_list` is now `[ (user_input[0], user_input[1]) ]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` starts from 0, it would be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration if the loop continues. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- The other states remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop itself.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `user_input` is a list of integers, `input_list` is now `[ (user_input[0], user_input[1]) ]`**
