The code assigns the second element of the `read_input` list to the variable `d`. The first element of `read_input` is assigned to `n`, and `read_input` is a list of integers. After executing the line `d = read_input[1]`, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and `d` is updated to the second element of `read_input`.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `read_input`; `d` is the second element of `read_input`; `read_input` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string**
