Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is calculated as `((j + 2k) + 1) + 1`.
   - `partial_sum` is updated as `partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - 2 * input_list[j][1]`.
   - `max_factor` is updated as `max(max_factor, partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - input_list[j][1])`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must be true.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` would be 4 (if it were to increment).
   - Therefore, we need `input_list[4][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` to be true.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` can be incremented to 4 and the loop condition holds true.
   - The state `i` is 3 implies that `i` could be incremented to 4.
   - However, the values of `j` and the elements in `input_list` might change inside the loop, but they are not specified in the current context. Thus, we cannot directly modify them without knowing their exact values.
   - The key is to ensure the loop condition holds for `i = 4`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `input_list[4][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must hold true for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 4, `j` is ((j + 2k) + 1) + 1, `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - 2 * input_list[j][1]`, `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - input_list[j][1]`, and `input_list[4][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must hold true**.
