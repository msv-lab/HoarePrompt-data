The code initializes an empty list `input_list`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `d`, or `read_input`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `read_input`; `d` is the second element of `read_input`; `read_input` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string; `input_list` is an empty list**
