The code `read_input = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads input from the user and splits it into multiple integers, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variable `read_input`. The initial values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged.

The input is split into a list of integers, which are assigned to `read_input`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we represent `read_input` as a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5, and d is a non-negative integer; read_input is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string**
