The code initializes the variable `j` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of 0 to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `user_input` is a list of integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`, `input_list` is a list of tuples where each tuple is sorted based on the first two elements of `user_input`, `max_factor` is the second element of `user_input`, `partial_sum` is equal to `max_factor`, `j` is 0**
