The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial value of `j` is given by the expression `(j + 2k) + 1`. Since `j` itself is part of this expression and its initial value is not provided (only its definition in terms of `k`), we can only say that `j` is increased by 1. 

Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is ((j + 2k) + 1) + 1, `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - 2 * input_list[j][1]`, `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - input_list[j][1]`**
