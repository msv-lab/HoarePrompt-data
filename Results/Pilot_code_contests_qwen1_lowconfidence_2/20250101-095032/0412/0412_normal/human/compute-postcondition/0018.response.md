Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `read_input` is a list of integers
   - `d` is the second element of `read_input`
   - `user_input` is a list of integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`
   - `input_list` is a list of tuples where each tuple is sorted based on the first two elements of `user_input`
   - `max_factor` is the second element of `user_input`
   - `partial_sum` is equal to `max_factor`
   - `j` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `i` should be within the specified range (1 to `n`).
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` starts at 1, the first condition to check is if `i` is less than `n` for the loop to start.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` (initially 1) is less than `n` for the loop to start executing.
   - `n` is already stated to be greater than 0, so we only need to adjust the initial state of `i`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial state should include `i` being 1, and `n` being greater than 0 (which is already given).

Therefore, the required state adjustment for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1** (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i < n`).
