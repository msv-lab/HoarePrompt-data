The code updates the `max_factor` by taking the maximum value between `max_factor` and `partial_sum`. Since `partial_sum` is defined as `partial_sum` plus `input_list[i][1]`, and `i` and `j` are specific to their original values, the only change is in `max_factor`.

- `i` is the original value of `i_current + k + 1`
- `j` is the original value of `j + k`
- `partial_sum` is the previous value of `partial_sum` plus `input_list[i][1]`
- `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`
- `input_list[i][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`

Therefore, the `max_factor` is updated, but the exact new value depends on the current `max_factor` and the value of `partial_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the original value of `i_current + k + 1`, `j` is the original value of `j + k`, `partial_sum` is the previous value of `partial_sum` plus `input_list[i][1]`, `max_factor` is the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`, and `input_list[i][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`.**
