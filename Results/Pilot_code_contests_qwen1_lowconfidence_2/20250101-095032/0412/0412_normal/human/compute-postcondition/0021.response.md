`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `partial_sum` also remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify these variables. The only change is that `j` is now `j + 1`. 

Output State: **`i` is 1; `partial_sum` is reduced by `input_list[j][1]` where `j` is such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`; `j` is `j + 1`.**
