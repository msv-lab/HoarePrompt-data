Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is `i_current + 2`
   - `j` is `j + 1`
   - `partial_sum` is `input_list[i_current + 1][1] - 2 * input_list[j][1]`
   - `max_factor` is unchanged
   - `input_list[i_current + 2][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` to be at least `d`.
   - From the given state, we know `i = i_current + 2` and `j = j + 1`. Therefore, the next iteration would involve incrementing `i` and `j` by 1.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` and `j` are incremented in the loop body (assuming typical increment operations inside the loop), the next values would be:
     - `i` becomes `i_current + 3`
     - `j` becomes `j + 2`
   - The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must still hold true for the next iteration.
   - Additionally, `partial_sum` and `max_factor` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `input_list[i_current + 3][0] - input_list[j + 2][0]` must be at least `d`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is `i_current + 3`, `j` is `j + 2`, `partial_sum` is unchanged, `max_factor` is unchanged, and `input_list[i_current + 3][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j + 2][0]`**
