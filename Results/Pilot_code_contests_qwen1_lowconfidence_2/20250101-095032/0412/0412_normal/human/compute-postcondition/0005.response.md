The code `user_input = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes a user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `user_input`. Since `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user, `user_input` becomes a list of integers from the input. 

Before the code executes, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, and `input_list` is an empty list. After the code executes, `input_list` will be updated to be the same as `user_input`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `input_list` is now equal to `user_input` (a list of integers from user input)**
