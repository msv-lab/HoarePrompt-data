The code assigns the first element of the list `read_input` to the variable `n`. The value of `n` is now updated to the first element of `read_input`, while the other elements of `read_input` remain unchanged. The variable `d` and the variable `read_input` itself are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `read_input`; `d` is a non-negative integer; `read_input` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string**
