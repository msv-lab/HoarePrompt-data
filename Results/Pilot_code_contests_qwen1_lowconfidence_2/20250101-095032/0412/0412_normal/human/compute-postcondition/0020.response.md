`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, where `j` is an index such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`. The initial state of `i` is 1, and the condition that there must exist a `j` such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` still holds. The value of `input_list[j][1]` is unknown, but it will be subtracted from `partial_sum`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `partial_sum` is reduced by `input_list[j][1]` where `j` is such that `input_list[1][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.**
