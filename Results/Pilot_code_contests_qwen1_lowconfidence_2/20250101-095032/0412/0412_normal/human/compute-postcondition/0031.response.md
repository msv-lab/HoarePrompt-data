Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` because `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is `2`
   - `j` is `j + k` (the exact value of `j` is not specified, but it has been updated by adding `k`)
   - `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1]` (meaning `partial_sum` has been incremented by `input_list[1][1]`)
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value (unspecified) and `partial_sum`

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `3`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each time, the condition `i < n` must still hold true.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `3`.
   - `j` will be updated again by adding `k`, making it `j + 2k` (since it was already `j + k`).
   - `partial_sum` will be updated again by adding `input_list[1][1]`, making it `partial_sum + input_list[1][1]`.
   - `max_factor` will remain the maximum of its original value and the new `partial_sum`.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `j + 2k`, `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1]`, `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`**
