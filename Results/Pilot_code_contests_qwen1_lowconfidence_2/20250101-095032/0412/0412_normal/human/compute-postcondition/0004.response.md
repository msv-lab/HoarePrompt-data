To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is the first element of `read_input`.
   - `d` is the second element of `read_input`.
   - `read_input` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string.
   - `input_list` is an empty list.

2. **For Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations, where `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time until `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` (the number of iterations) must be a positive integer greater than 0.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- `n` is greater than 0, so the loop can run for at least one iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `input_list` is an empty list**
