`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i_current` remains unchanged, so `i` is still `i_current + 2`. The value of `input_list[j]` changes due to the increment, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `partial_sum` and `max_factor` remain unchanged, and the condition that `input_list[i_current + 2][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]` still holds. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is `j + 1`, `partial_sum` is `input_list[i_current + 1][1] - 2 * input_list[j][1]`, `max_factor` is unchanged, and `input_list[i_current + 2][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`**
