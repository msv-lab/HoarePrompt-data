The code snippet updates the `max_factor` by setting it to the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`. This means that `max_factor` will be increased if `partial_sum` is greater than the current value of `max_factor`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `i` is incremented to the final index where the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` no longer holds, `j` is incremented to the final index where the condition holds, `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i][1]`, and `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - input_list[j][1]` for each iteration where the condition is met.

Since the code only updates `max_factor`, the output state will reflect this change. However, the exact value of `max_factor` cannot be determined without knowing the previous values of `max_factor` and `partial_sum`. We know that `max_factor` is now the maximum of its previous value and `partial_sum`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented to the final index where the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` no longer holds, `j` is incremented to the final index where the condition holds, `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i][1]`, and `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.**
