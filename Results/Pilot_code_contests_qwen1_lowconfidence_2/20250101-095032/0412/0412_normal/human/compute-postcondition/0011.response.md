`user_input` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `user_input` will be a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces and converted to integers. The original `user_input` is replaced by this new list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `user_input` is now a list of integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`, `input_list` is now `[ (user_input[0], user_input[1]) ]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `read_input` is a list of integers, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `user_input` is a list of integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`, `input_list` is now `[ (user_input[0], user_input[1]) ]`**
