The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` was originally calculated as `((j + 2k) + 1) + 1`. Since the value of `j` is now incremented by 1, the new value of `j` is `(((j + 2k) + 1) + 1) + 1`. However, without knowing the value of `k`, we cannot simplify this further. 

The other variables (`i`, `partial_sum`, `max_factor`, and `input_list`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 4; `j` is ((((j + 2k) + 1) + 1) + 1); `partial_sum` is `partial_sum - input_list[j][1]`; `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum + input_list[1][1] - input_list[j][1]`; and `input_list[4][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must hold true.**
