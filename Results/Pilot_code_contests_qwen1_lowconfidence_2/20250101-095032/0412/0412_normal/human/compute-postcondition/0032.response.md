Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is `j + 2k`
   - `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1]`
   - `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must be true.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is some value (which is `j + 2k`)
   - `partial_sum` has been updated by adding `input_list[1][1]` to its original value.
   - `max_factor` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`.

5. **Determining `j`:**
   - Since `j` is defined as `j + 2k`, we need to know the current value of `j` to check the loop condition. However, without knowing the exact value of `k`, we cannot directly determine `j`. 

6. **Determining `input_list[i][0]` and `input_list[j][0]`:**
   - `input_list[i][0]` is the first element of `input_list[3]`.
   - `input_list[j][0]` is the first element of `input_list[j]`.

7. **Ensuring the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `input_list[3][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.
   - To ensure this condition is met, we need to adjust either `input_list[3][0]` or `input_list[j][0]`.

Given the information, we can only be certain about `i` being 3. We do not have specific values for `j`, `d`, or the elements in `input_list`. Therefore, we need to focus on ensuring the condition is met based on the given information.

Since we don't have specific values for `j`, `d`, or the elements in `input_list`, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where `j` might be adjusted to satisfy the condition. 

However, without specific values, we can only adjust the known part of the condition based on the current state. The key is to ensure `input_list[3][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` holds true. Given `i` is fixed at 3, the adjustment should be on `j` or `d`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute at least once. This involves making sure that the condition `input_list[3][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` is satisfied.

Since we don't have specific values for `j` or `d`, we need to make sure the initial conditions are such that the loop can start.

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `j + 2k`, `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1]`, `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`, and the initial values of `input_list[3][0]` and `input_list[j][0]` should be such that `input_list[3][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`**.

Given the constraints, the best we can do is to ensure the loop can start, which means:

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `j + 2k`, `partial_sum` is `partial_sum + input_list[1][1]`, `max_factor` is the maximum of its original value and `partial_sum`, and `input_list[3][0]` and `input_list[j][0]` should be such that `input_list[3][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`**.
