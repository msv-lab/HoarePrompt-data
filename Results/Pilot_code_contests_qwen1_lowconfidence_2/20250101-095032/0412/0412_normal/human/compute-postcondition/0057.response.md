Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is the index where the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] < d` first holds, `partial_sum` is the maximum of its original value and the sum of selected elements from `input_list`, `max_factor` is the maximum value of `partial_sum` after all iterations, and `input_list[i][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]` if `i < n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
- **`j`**: The loop increments `j` until the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] < d` holds. This means `j` will be the last index where this condition was true.
- **`partial_sum`**: The loop updates `partial_sum` by adding and subtracting elements from `input_list`. The final value of `partial_sum` will be the maximum value it attains during the loop execution.
- **`max_factor`**: The loop updates `max_factor` to be the maximum of its original value and the current value of `partial_sum` after each iteration. Therefore, `max_factor` will be the highest value of `partial_sum` encountered during the loop.
- **Condition**: For every `i < n`, `input_list[i][0]` must be at least `d` units greater than `input_list[j][0]`.

This output state encapsulates the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all possible iterations based on the given conditions.
