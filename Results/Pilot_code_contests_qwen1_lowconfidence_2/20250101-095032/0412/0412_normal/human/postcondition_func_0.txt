The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `d` (a non-negative integer), along with a list of friends described by their `mi` and `si` values. It processes this input to find the maximum possible sum of `si` values such that the corresponding `mi` values are at most `d` units apart. The function sorts the input list of friends by their `mi` values, then iterates through the sorted list to maintain a running sum of `si` values while ensuring the difference between consecutive `mi` values does not exceed `d`. The function outputs the maximum sum found. The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when no valid pairs exist within the given constraint. If no valid pairs can be formed, the function will output 0.
