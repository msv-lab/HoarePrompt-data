The function processes an \( n \times n \) board represented as a list of \( n \) strings, where each string contains \( n \) space-separated integers. It calculates the sum of each row and each column in the board. Then, it counts the number of times the sum of a column is greater than the sum of any row. If \( n \) is 0, the function does nothing and does not produce any output. If \( n \) is less than or equal to 30, the function prints the count of such instances.
