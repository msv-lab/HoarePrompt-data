You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

Note

In the first example two upper squares are winning.

In the third example three left squares in the both middle rows are winning:
    
    
    5 7 8 4  
    9 5 3 2  
    1 6 6 4  
    9 5 7 3
