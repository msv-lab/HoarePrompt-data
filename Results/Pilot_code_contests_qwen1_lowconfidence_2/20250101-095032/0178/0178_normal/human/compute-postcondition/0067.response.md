Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `compt` is 1 if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 0 otherwise.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n`.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range [0, n-1].
   - Since `j` is currently `n`, it is out of the valid range [0, n-1].

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - To prepare for the next iteration, we need to reset `j` to 0.
   - `compt` remains unchanged as the condition to change `compt` is based on the comparison inside the loop, which hasn't happened yet.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be set to 0.
- `compt` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:

State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 1 if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 0 otherwise.**
