The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state includes that the input is a list of n strings representing rows of an n Ã— n board, the first line of the code takes this n and converts it into an integer. The other parts of the initial state (the list of strings representing the board) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n strings, where each string represents a row of the n Ã— n board and contains n space-separated integers; `n` is an integer obtained from the input.**
