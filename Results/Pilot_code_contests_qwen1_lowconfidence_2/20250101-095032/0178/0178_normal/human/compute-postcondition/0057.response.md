Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `col[i]` is `C + T_val + T[j][i]`
   - `i` is `i`
   - `j` is `j + 1`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `j` needs to be updated to `j + 2` (since it was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The other variables (`col[i]` and `i`) remain unchanged.

5. **New State:**
   - `col[i]` remains `C + T_val + T[j][i]` but now `j` is `j + 2`.
   - `i` remains `i`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`col[i]` is `C + T_val + T[j + 1][i]`, `i` is `i`, `j` is `j + 2`**
