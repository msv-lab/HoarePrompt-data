The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` increments the value of `lig[i]` by the value of `T[i][j]`. Given that `j` is 3 and `j` must be less than `n`, the value of `lig[i]` is updated to its current value plus `T[i][3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lig[i]` is now `lig[i] + T[i][3]`, `j` is 3, and `j` is less than `n`**
