Postcondition: ***`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is greater than 1, `j` is any value in the range [0, n-1], `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`, and `lig[j]` is defined for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].***
