`col[i]` is initially equal to `C + T_val`. The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` increments `col[i]` by the value of `T[j][i]`. The other variables `i`, `j`, and `T_val` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated value of `col[i]` is `C + T_val + T[j][i]`.

Output State: **`col[i]` is `C + T_val + T[j][i]`, `i` is `i`, `j` is `j + 1`**
