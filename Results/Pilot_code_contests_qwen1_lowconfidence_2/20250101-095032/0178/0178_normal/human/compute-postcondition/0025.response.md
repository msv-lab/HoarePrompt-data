Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step by step to determine the final state after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
- All other elements in `lig` are 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is \( n-1 \).
- `n` is a positive integer.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(n):
    lig[i] += T[i][j]
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- During each iteration, `lig[i]` is updated by adding the element `T[i][j]`.

### Output State After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
- Given that the loop executes `k` times (where \( k \) is the number of columns in the matrix `T`), the final value of `lig[i]` will be the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`.

### Determining the Final State:
- Since the loop runs for all columns from 0 to \( n-1 \), `i` remains constant at 1 throughout the loop.
- Therefore, `lig[1]` will be the sum of all elements in the 1st row of the matrix `T`.
- The loop does not modify any other elements in `lig` since only `lig[i]` (where `i` is fixed) is being updated.
- The variables `i` and `j` will be out of scope after the loop completes.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop executes all iterations, `lig[1]` will be the sum of all elements in the 1st row of the matrix `T`.
- `lig[0]` will retain its initial value, which is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
- `i` and `j` will no longer be relevant after the loop.

### Output State:
**Output State: `lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, `lig[1]` is the sum of all elements in the 1-st row of the matrix `T`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer.**
