Let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided initial state and the output states for the first few iterations.

### Initial State
- `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `compt` is 0.
- `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

### Loop Code
```
for j in range(n):
    if col[i] > lig[j]:
        compt += 1
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i` being `n` and `compt` being 0. The loop condition is that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute. This means `i` will decrement from `n` to `0` during the loop iterations.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, `compt` is incremented only if `col[i] > lig[j]`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `0` (since it starts from `n` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`).
   - `compt` will be the count of indices `j` (from `0` to `n-1`) for which `col[i] > lig[j]` holds true.

### Final Output State
Given that the loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`, and `compt` is incremented based on the condition `col[i] > lig[j]`, we can conclude the following:

- `col[i]` remains the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
- `i` becomes `0` after the loop completes.
- `compt` will be the total number of times `col[i] > lig[j]` was true over all iterations of `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is 0, `j` is any value in the range [0, n-1], `n` is a positive integer, and `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]`.**
