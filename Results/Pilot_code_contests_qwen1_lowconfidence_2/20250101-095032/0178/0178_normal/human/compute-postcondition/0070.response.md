Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1]
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `compt` is 2 if `compt` was initially 1 and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 1 if `compt` was initially 0 or if `col[i]` is not greater than `lig[j]`

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - We need to determine the state after one more iteration of the loop.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - `i` remains constant throughout the loop, so `i` will still be `n - 1`.
   - `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

4. **State After One More Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.

5. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j < n`, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` should be less than `n`.
   - `compt` remains unchanged based on the given conditions (it is already set to either 1 or 2).

Given this analysis, we can now provide the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop:

**State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 2 if `compt` was initially 1 and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 1 if `compt` was initially 0 or if `col[i]` is not greater than `lig[j]`**
