Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[i] > lig[j]` for all `i` in the range [0, n-1].**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `col[i]` is set as the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1]. This initialization is done outside the loop.
- **Loop Execution**: The nested loop runs for each `i` in the range [0, n-1]. For each `i`, it iterates through `j` in the range [0, n-1]. During this iteration, `compt` increments by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`.
- **Final State**:
  - After the loop completes, `col[i]` remains unchanged for each `i` because the loop only increments `compt` based on the comparison between `col[i]` and `lig[j]`. The values of `col[i]` do not change inside the loop.
  - `i` will be `n` after the loop finishes because the outer loop runs `n` times.
  - `j` is irrelevant to the final state since the loop condition ensures it runs within the range [0, n-1].
  - `n` remains as the positive integer it was initialized as.
  - `compt` is the cumulative count of indices `j` for which `col[i] > lig[j]` for all `i` in the range [0, n-1].

Thus, the final state after the loop has executed all iterations is that `compt` holds the count of comparisons where `col[i] > lig[j]` for all `i` in the range [0, n-1].
