Output State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of matrix `T`, `j` is `n`, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` in the specified range from `0` to `n-1`.
- During each iteration, the value of `lig[i]` is updated by adding the corresponding element `T[i][j]`.
- After the loop completes, `lig[i]` will hold the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`.

Since the loop runs until `j` is less than `n`, and `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, it will run exactly `n` times. After completing these `n` iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, and `i` will also be equal to `n` because `i` is incremented within the loop body.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `n` is `0`), then `j` will never become `n`, and the values of `lig` and `i` will remain as they were initially. However, since the problem specifies that the loop executes some number of times, we can assume that `n` is at least `1`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is that `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of matrix `T`, `j` is `n`, and `i` is `n`.
