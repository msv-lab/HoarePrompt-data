Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and is incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `2`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `col[0]` remains unchanged as it was calculated before the loop started and does not depend on `j`.
   - `i` remains `n + 1` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `compt` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop since no condition to increment it based on `col[i] > lig[j]` has been met (since `i` is `n + 1` and `j` starts from `0`).

5. **Updated States:**
   - `col[0]` remains the same.
   - `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `j` becomes `2`.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `compt` remains the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]`.

**Final State:**
State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2`, `n` is a positive integer, and `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`.**
