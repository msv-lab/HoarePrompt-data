Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
- `lig[1]` is `T[1][j]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is \( n-1 \).
- `n` is greater than 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is \( n-1 \).

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented and still within the range defined by `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, `j` must go from \( n-1 \) to \( n \). However, since `j` is an integer, it can only take integer values. Hence, the next possible value for `j` is 0 if `n > 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be \( (n-1) + 1 = n \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 because `j` must stay within the range of `range(n)`.

### Updated State:
- `lig[0]` remains the same as it is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
- `lig[1]` will now be `T[1][n]` because `j` is now `n`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` is now \( n \).
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, `lig[1]` is `T[1][n]`, `i` is 1, `j` is \( n \), `n` must be greater than 1**
