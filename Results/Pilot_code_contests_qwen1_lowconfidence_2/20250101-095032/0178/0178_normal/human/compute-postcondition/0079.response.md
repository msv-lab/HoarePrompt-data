Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - `i` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is any value in the range [0, n-1].
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[0] > lig[j]`.
   - `lig[j]` is defined for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - For each iteration, it checks if `col[0] > lig[j]`.
   - If true, `compt` is incremented.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from its current value.
   - Since `j` is any value in the range [0, n-1], the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `col[0]` remains unchanged because the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` does not change with the loop.
   - `i` remains greater than 1 because the loop only increments `j`.
   - `j` changes to `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `compt` may or may not change depending on whether `col[0] > lig[j + 1]`.
   - `lig[j]` is defined for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], so this remains unchanged.

5. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `col[0]` is the same as before.
   - `i` remains greater than 1.
   - `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - `compt` may or may not have been incremented based on the condition `col[0] > lig[j + 1]`.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `lig[j]` is defined for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].

Given these points, we can summarize the states needed for the next iteration:

State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is greater than 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `compt` may or may not have been incremented based on the condition `col[0] > lig[j + 1]`, and `n` is a positive integer.**
