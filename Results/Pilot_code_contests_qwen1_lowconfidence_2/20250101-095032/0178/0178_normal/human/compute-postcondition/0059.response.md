Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop completes, `j` is `n`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each index `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, the value of `col[i]` is updated by adding `T[j][i]` to it.
- After the loop completes, `col[i]` will hold the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- The variable `i` will be the final value it took after the loop completes, and `j` will be `n` because the loop increments `j` up to `n-1` and then stops.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is `0`), then `col[i]` remains its initial value `C`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is `0` (since it starts from `0`). However, since the problem specifies the output state after some number of executions, we assume the loop does execute at least once unless stated otherwise.
