The `print(compt)` statement outputs the value of the variable `compt`, which is the count of indices `j` for which `col[i] > lig[j]` for all `i` in the range [0, n-1]. However, the value of `compt` itself does not change as a result of this print statement. All other variables remain in their previous state.

Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[i] > lig[j]` for all `i` in the range [0, n-1]**
