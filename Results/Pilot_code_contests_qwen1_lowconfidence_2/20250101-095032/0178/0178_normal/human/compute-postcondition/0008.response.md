Output State: **`T` is an `n x n` matrix where each element is an integer. For every row `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n), `T[i]` contains a list of integers `[int(a1), int(a2), ..., int(an)]`, where `a1, a2, ..., an` are the integers entered in the corresponding input lines during the loop iterations. The loop does not execute if `n` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- During each iteration, the `i`-th row of the matrix `T` is updated with a new list of integers read from the input.
- After all iterations, the matrix `T` will have `n` rows, each containing a list of integers.
- If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and the matrix `T` remains an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.
