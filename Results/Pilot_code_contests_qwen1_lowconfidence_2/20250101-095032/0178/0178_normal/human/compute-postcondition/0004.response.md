According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop` and the value of `n`. If `loop` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is an `n x n` matrix where the `i`-th row is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`, and `loop` is the value of `i`.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `loop` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, the condition `loop < n` must still hold true.

Given these conditions, let's adjust the states:

1. The value of `loop` at the end of the previous iteration is `i`.
2. For the next iteration, `loop` will be `i + 1`.
3. The matrix `T` remains the same as it was after the previous iteration.
4. The condition for the loop to continue is `loop < n`, so `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`T` is an `n x n` matrix with all elements initially set to zero except for the `i`-th row, which is now a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`, `loop` is `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`**.
