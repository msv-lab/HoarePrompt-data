State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 0, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1]
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` is `n`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `compt` is 0

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `i` is currently set to `n`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < n` required for the loop to execute.
   - We need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `n` and within the valid range.

4. **Updated States**:
   - Adjust `i` to be less than `n` (e.g., `i = 0` would be a valid starting point).
   - Ensure `n` remains as a positive integer.
   - Keep `j` at `n` as it is not directly involved in the loop condition.
   - Keep `compt` as 0 since it is not used in the loop condition.

Thus, the final state should reflect that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute.
