Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `compt` is 0.
   - `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(n)`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start, the condition `i < n` must be true.
   - Since `i` is currently set to `n`, this condition is false, and the loop will not execute as long as `i` remains `n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the value of `i` such that `i < n`.
   - We should also ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to proceed.

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to set `i` to a value less than `n` (e.g., `i = n - 1`).
   - All other states remain the same.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
**`i` must be less than `n` and a valid value (e.g., `i = n - 1`)**.

The final state after adjustment is:
State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 0**
