Postcondition: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is n+1, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[n] > lig[j]`. The current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`**
