The code `T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))` takes user input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the corresponding row in the matrix `T`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `loop`, let's assume `loop` is a specific index, say `i`, which is within the bounds of the matrix (0 to n-1).

Let's consider the following:

1. `T` is an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.
2. `loop` is an index within the range of the matrix (0 to n-1).
3. `raw_input()` reads a line from the standard input and `split(' ')` splits this line into a list of strings.
4. `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer.
5. `T[loop]` is then assigned this list of integers.

Since the exact input values are not provided, let's denote the input as a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.

Output State: **`T` is an `n x n` matrix with all elements initially set to zero except for the `i`-th row, which is now a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.**
