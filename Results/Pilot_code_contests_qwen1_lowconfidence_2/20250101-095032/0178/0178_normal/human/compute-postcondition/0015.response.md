According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` using `range(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `lig[0]` is `T[0][0] + T[0][1]`
- All other elements in `lig` are 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The value of `j` will be incremented by 1.
2. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given that `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2 (assuming `n` is at least 2).

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `lig[0]` remains unchanged as it was only set once at the start of the loop based on the values of `T[0][0]` and `T[0][1]`.
- All other elements in `lig` remain 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` becomes 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`lig[0]` is `T[0][0] + T[0][1]`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
