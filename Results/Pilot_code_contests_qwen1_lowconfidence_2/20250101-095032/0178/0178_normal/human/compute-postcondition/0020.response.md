The code updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`
- All other elements in `lig` are 0
- `i` is 1
- `j` is \( n-1 \)
- `n` must be greater than 0

Since `i` is 1, the code updates `lig[1]` by adding `T[1][j]` to it. The initial value of `lig[1]` is 0, so `lig[1]` will now be the value of `T[1][j]`.

The other variables (`lig[0]`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, `lig[1]` is `T[1][j]`, `i` is 1, `j` is \( n-1 \), `n` is greater than 0**
