According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `lig[1]` is `T[1][n]`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given that `j` starts at `n` (which is greater than 1) and increases by 1 with each iteration, the loop will not execute because `j` is already equal to `n` and will not become less than `n` in the next iteration.

However, if we assume there was a typo and `j` should start from `0` instead of `n`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be set to `0` and the condition `j < n` would need to hold true.

Since the provided state indicates `j` is already `n`, and the loop will not execute again under these conditions, we need to reframe the answer based on the actual state provided.

State: **`lig[1]` is `T[1][n]`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, and the loop will not execute again.**
