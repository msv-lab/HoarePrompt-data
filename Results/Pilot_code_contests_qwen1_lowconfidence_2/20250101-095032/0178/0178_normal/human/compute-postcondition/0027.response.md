Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `lig[0]`: Sum of all elements in the 0-th row of matrix `T`.
   - `lig[1]`: Sum of all elements in the 1-st row of matrix `T`.
   - `i`: 2.
   - `j`: `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.
   - Since the loop starts with `j = n`, we need to ensure that `j < n` is false initially, so the loop body is not executed.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The initial state of `j` is `n`, and the loop will not execute if `j` starts at `n` because `j` would immediately be out of the range `[0, n-1]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop does not execute based on the initial values provided.

**State:**
**`lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, `lig[1]` is the sum of all elements in the 1-st row of the matrix `T`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, and the loop will not execute because `j` is equal to `n`.**
