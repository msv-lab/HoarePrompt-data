Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of matrix `T` for every `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `col` is a list of `n` zeros.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop runs for `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range `[0, n-1]`. Since `i` is currently `n`, it is outside this range and the loop will not execute.
   - To make the loop execute, `i` needs to be set to a value within the range `[0, n-1]`.

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The values of `j`, `col`, and `lig` are not directly relevant to the loop condition but might be necessary inside the loop body.
   - `n` being a positive integer is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - We need to adjust `i` to a value within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`total` is undefined, `i` must be within the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `col` is a list of `n` zeros**.
