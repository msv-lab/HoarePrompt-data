`compt` is incremented by 1. The value of `compt` was initially 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 1, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`**
