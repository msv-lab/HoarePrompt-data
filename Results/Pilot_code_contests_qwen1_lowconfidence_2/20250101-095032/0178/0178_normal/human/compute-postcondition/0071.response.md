The value of `compt` is incremented by 1. Initially, `compt` is 2 if it was 1 and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, or 1 otherwise. Since the value of `compt` is being incremented by 1, regardless of its initial value, the new value of `compt` will be 3 if it was initially 2, and 2 if it was initially 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 3 if it was initially 2 and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 2 if it was initially 1 or if `col[i]` is not greater than `lig[j]`.**
