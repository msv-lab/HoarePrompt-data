Postcondition: ***`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`. If `col[i] > lig[j]`, `compt` is incremented by 1.***
