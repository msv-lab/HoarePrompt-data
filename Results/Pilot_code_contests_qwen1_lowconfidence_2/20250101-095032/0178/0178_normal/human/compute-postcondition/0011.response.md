Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is an integer.
- `lig` is a list of \( n \) zeros.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### For Loop
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Variable (`j`)**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Initialization of `j`**:
   - The loop starts with `j = 0`.
   - This is automatically taken care of by the `range(n)` function, which starts counting from `0`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 (given in the initial state), the condition `j < n` will always be true for at least one value of `j`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` is already set to 0, which is fine.
   - We need to ensure that `j` starts at 0 and increases up to `n-1`.
   - The matrix `T` and the list `lig` are not directly involved in the loop condition but are part of the loop body, so no adjustment is needed for them specifically regarding the loop execution.

### Conclusion
Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and `j` will increment until `j < n` (which is true as `n > 0`), no specific adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. However, we should clearly state the initial state of `j`.

### Final State
State: **`T` is an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is an integer, `lig` is a list of \( n \) zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
