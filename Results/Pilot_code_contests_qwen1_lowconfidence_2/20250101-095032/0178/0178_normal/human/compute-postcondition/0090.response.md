Postcondition: ***`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is n+1, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`. Since there is no else part, if `col[i] > lig[j]`, `compt` is incremented by 1.***
