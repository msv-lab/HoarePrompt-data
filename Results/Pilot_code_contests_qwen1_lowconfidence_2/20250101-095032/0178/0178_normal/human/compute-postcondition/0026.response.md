According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, `lig[1]` is the sum of all elements in the 1-st row of the matrix `T`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `i` should be 2, and `j` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop condition.

State: **`lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, `lig[1]` is the sum of all elements in the 1-st row of the matrix `T`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`**
