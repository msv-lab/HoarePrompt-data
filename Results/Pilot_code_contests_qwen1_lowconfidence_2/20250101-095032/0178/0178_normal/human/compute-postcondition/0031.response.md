According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lig[i]` is updated to `lig[i] + T[i][3]`, `j` is 3, and `j` is less than `n`.

Given that `j` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to become 4. Additionally, since the condition for the loop is that `j` must be less than `n`, `n` must remain the same or be adjusted if necessary to ensure the loop can continue.

However, based on the information provided, we only know that `j` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, but we do not have the exact value of `n`. Therefore, we assume `n` remains the same and only update `j` to 4.

State: **`lig[i]` is now `lig[i] + T[i][3]`, `j` is 4, and `j` is less than `n`**
