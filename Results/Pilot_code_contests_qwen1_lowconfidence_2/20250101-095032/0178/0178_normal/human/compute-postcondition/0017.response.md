Let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is an integer.
- `lig` is a list of \( n \) zeros.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.

### Loop Code
```
for j in range(n):
    lig[i] += T[i][j]
```

### Analysis
1. **First Iteration (j = 0):**
   - `lig[0]` becomes `T[0][0]`.
   - All other elements in `lig` remain 0.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Second Iteration (j = 1):**
   - `lig[0]` becomes `T[0][0] + T[0][1]`.
   - All other elements in `lig` remain 0.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` is 1.

3. **Third Iteration (j = 2):**
   - `lig[0]` becomes `T[0][0] + T[0][1] + T[0][2]`.
   - All other elements in `lig` remain 0.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` is 2.

### General Pattern
- After \( k \) iterations, `lig[0]` will be the sum of the first \( k \) elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix `T`.
- `lig` remains a list of \( n \) zeros, except for the first element which is updated.
- `i` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- `j` takes on values from 0 to \( n-1 \).

### Conclusion
- After all iterations (when `j` ranges from 0 to \( n-1 \)), `lig[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
- All other elements in `lig` will still be 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` will be \( n-1 \).

### Final Output State
Output State: **`lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is \( n-1 \).**
