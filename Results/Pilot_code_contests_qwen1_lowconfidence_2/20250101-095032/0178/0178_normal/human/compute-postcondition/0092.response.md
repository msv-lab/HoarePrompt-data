`compt` is incremented by 1. The value of `compt` was previously the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`. Now, `compt` will be that count plus 1. The values of `col[0]`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `lig` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`, plus 1.**
