`compt` is incremented by 1. The value of `compt` was previously either incremented based on the condition `col[0] > lig[j + 1]` or it was not. Since the code only increments `compt` by 1, the output state is: `col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is greater than 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `compt` is incremented by 1 (from its previous value), and `n` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is greater than 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `compt` is incremented by 1, and `n` is a positive integer.**
