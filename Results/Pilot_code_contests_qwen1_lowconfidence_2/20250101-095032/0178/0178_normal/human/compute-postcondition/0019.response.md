Let's break down the given information and the loop statement to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
- All other elements in `lig` are 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is \( n-1 \).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop will iterate over the range defined by `range(n)`. For the loop to start executing, `j` must be initialized to a value that falls within this range. Since the loop starts with `j = n-1`, this initialization is already correct.
   
2. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is given as 1, but since the loop is iterating over `j`, the value of `i` does not directly affect the loop's execution. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i`.

3. **Variable `lig`**: The array `lig` is partially initialized such that `lig[0]` contains the sum of the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, and all other elements are 0. This initialization is fine for the loop to proceed, as it doesn't directly depend on the loop variable `j`.

4. **Variable `n`**: The loop will iterate from `j = n-1` to `j = 0` (assuming `n > 0`). To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0. 

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is \( n-1 \), `n` must be greater than 0**
