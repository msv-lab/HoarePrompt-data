Output State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n`, `j` is any value in the range [0, n-1], `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[n] > lig[j]`. `lig[j]` is defined for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initially, `col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `j` iterates over the range [0, n-1].
   - `compt` is initialized to count the number of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `lig[j]` is defined for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations because `i` starts at 1 and is incremented until it reaches `n`.
   - In each iteration, `compt` is incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n`.
   - The loop will have checked `col[i]` (which is `col[n]`) against `lig[j]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - Therefore, `compt` will be the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]`.

4. **No Loop Execution:**
   - If the loop does not execute (e.g., due to an early termination condition), `i` will still be 1, and `compt` will retain its initial value, which is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` before the loop started.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes all iterations is that `col[0]` remains the sum of all elements `T[j][0]`, `i` becomes `n`, `j` remains in the range [0, n-1], `n` is a positive integer, and `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[n] > lig[j]`.
