`compt` is incremented by 1 because the condition `col[0] > lig[j]` is true, and the value of `i` remains unchanged. The values of `col`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `lig` remain as they were initially.

Output State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is n+1, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1, `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`**
