`compt` is incremented by 1, which means that the value of `compt` increases by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is greater than 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `compt` is incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j + 1]` (now `compt` is increased by 1), `n` is a positive integer, and `j + 1 < n`.

Output State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is greater than 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `compt` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `j + 1 < n`**
