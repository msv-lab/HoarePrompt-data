State: **`T` is an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is an integer, `lig` is a list of \( n \) zeros, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(n):` will start when `i` is in the range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
2. For the loop to start executing, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` will not produce any values if `n` is 0 or negative.
3. At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0 to match the starting condition of the `range` function.
4. The states of `T` and `lig` are already given and do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are that `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
