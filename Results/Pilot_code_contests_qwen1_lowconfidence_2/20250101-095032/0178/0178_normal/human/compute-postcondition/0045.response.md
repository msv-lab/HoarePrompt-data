Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
1. `total` is undefined.
2. `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`.
3. `j` is `n`.
4. `n` is a positive integer.
5. `col` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Variable (`j`)**:
   - The loop runs over `range(n)`, meaning `j` takes values from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The initial value of `j` is `n`, as stated in the problem.

2. **Range of the Loop**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (as already stated).
   - Since `j` starts at `n` and the loop iterates over `range(n)`, `j` will never equal any value in `range(n)` if `j` starts at `n`.

### Conclusion:
To allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust the initial state such that `j` is set to a value within the range `[0, n-1]`. This ensures that the loop can iterate properly.

### Adjusted States:
- `total` is undefined.
- `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`.
- `j` must be within the range `[0, n-1]` to allow the loop to execute.
- `n` is a positive integer.

Thus, the required adjustment is to set `j` to a value within the range `[0, n-1]`.

### Final State:
**State: **`total` is undefined, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`, `j` must be within the range `[0, n-1]`, `n` is a positive integer**
