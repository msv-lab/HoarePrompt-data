Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, the value of `col[i]` is updated by adding `T[j][i]` to its current value.
- After the loop completes, `col[i]` will contain the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`, but after the loop, it would be incremented to `n`.

Since the loop iterates through all possible values of `j` (from `0` to `n-1`), the final state of `col[i]` will be the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
