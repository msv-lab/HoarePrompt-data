The code initializes a list `lig` with `n` elements, where each element is set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `T`, which remains an `n x n` matrix where each element is an integer. Therefore, the only change is that `lig` is now a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`T` is an `n x n` matrix where each element is an integer; `lig` is a list of `n` zeros**
