The code initializes a list `col` with `n` zeros. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was used only in the context of the initial state. The value of `j` also remains unchanged as it was not involved in the code execution. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was used only in the context of the list initialization.

Output State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of matrix `T` for every `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `col` is a list of `n` zeros.**
