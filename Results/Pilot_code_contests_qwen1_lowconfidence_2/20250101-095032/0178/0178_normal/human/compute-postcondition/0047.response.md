According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `col[i]` is updated to `col[i] + T[j][i]`
- `i` is unchanged
- `j` is unchanged

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider what changes occur within the loop and how these changes affect the state.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. At the end of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
3. Since `i` and `j` are unchanged between iterations, the only thing that changes is the value of `col[i]` due to the update `col[i] = col[i] + T[j][i]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` was the last value it took (let's call this value `j_end`).

For the next iteration of the loop:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `j_end + 1`.

Since `j` must increment by 1 for the loop to continue, and there are no other changes to the state variables mentioned (`i` remains unchanged), the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`col[i]` is updated to `col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged**
