Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
   - All other elements in `lig` are 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is \( n-1 \).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - `j` remains unchanged because the loop body does not explicitly modify `j`.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `lig[0]` will remain the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`.
   - All other elements in `lig` will remain 0.
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `j` will still be \( n-1 \).

Therefore, the new state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`lig[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th row of the matrix `T`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is \( n-1 \)**.
