`lig[i]` is assigned the value of `lig[i] + T[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `lig[1]` is `T[1][n]`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n`. Therefore, `lig[1]` becomes `T[1][n] + T[1][n]`, which simplifies to `2 * T[1][n]`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`lig[1]` is `2 * T[1][n]`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, and the loop will not execute again.**
