The given code initializes a 2D list `T` with dimensions `n x n`, where each element is set to 0. This means that `T` is filled with zeros. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer obtained from the input, which remains unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, `T` will be an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.

Output State: **`T` is an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros, `n` is an integer obtained from the input.**
