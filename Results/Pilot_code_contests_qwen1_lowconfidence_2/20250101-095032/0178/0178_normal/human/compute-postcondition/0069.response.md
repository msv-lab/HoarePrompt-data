Postcondition: ***`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 2 if `compt` was initially 1 and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 1 if `compt` was initially 0 or if `col[i]` is not greater than `lig[j]`***
