The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to it. Given that `j` is 4, this means `lig[i]` is updated by adding `T[i][4]` to its current value. The initial state also mentions that `lig[i]` is currently `lig[i] + T[i][3]`. This implies that `lig[i]` already has a value which is the result of `lig[i] + T[i][3]`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `lig[i]` will be the sum of its current value (`lig[i] + T[i][3]`) and `T[i][4]`. 

Output State: **`lig[i]` is now `(lig[i] + T[i][3]) + T[i][4]`, `j` is 4, and `j` is less than `n`**
