`col[i]` is updated to `(col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]) + T[j][i]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented to `j + 1`. The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` updates `col[i]` by adding `T[j][i]` to its current value. Since `i` remains unchanged and `j` is incremented to `j + 1`, the output state is:

Output State: **`col[i]` is updated to `(col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]) + T[j][i]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented to `j + 1`**
