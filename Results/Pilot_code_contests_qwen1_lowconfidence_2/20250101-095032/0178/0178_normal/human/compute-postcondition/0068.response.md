The code `compt += 1` increments the value of `compt` by 1. Given that the initial state is `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 1 if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 0 otherwise, the only variable affected by the code is `compt`. Since the initial value of `compt` is either 1 (if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`) or 0 (if `col[i]` is less than or equal to `lig[j]`), incrementing `compt` by 1 changes its value to 2 (if `compt` was initially 1) or 1 (if `compt` was initially 0).

Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 2 if `compt` was initially 1 and `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`, and 1 if `compt` was initially 0 or if `col[i]` is not greater than `lig[j]`.**
