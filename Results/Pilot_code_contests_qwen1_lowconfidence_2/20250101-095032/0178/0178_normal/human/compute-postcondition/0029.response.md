According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `lig[i]` is updated to `lig[i] + T[i][j]`, and the values of `lig` and `T` for all other indices remain unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. Since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, the condition for the loop to continue is `j < n`.
2. After the previous iteration, `j` was incremented from the previous value, meaning it is now `j + 1`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`.

Let's assume `j` was previously `j` (let's say `j = k`), then after the previous iteration, `j` is now `k + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than `n`, so `j` itself must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1` and must satisfy the condition `j < n`.

Given this, we adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`lig[i]` is now `lig[i] + T[i][j]` where `j` is `k + 1` and `j` must be less than `n`**. 

In terms of a concrete example, if `j` was 2 before the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be 3 and `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`lig[i]` is now `lig[i] + T[i][j]`, and `j` is 3, and `j` must be less than `n`**.
