According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `col[i]` is `C + T_val`, `i` is `i`, and `j` is `j`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that `j` will be incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`, and it will be incremented to `j + 1`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is `j + 1` and still less than `n`.

State: **`col[i]` is `C + T_val`, `i` is `i`, `j` is `j + 1`**
