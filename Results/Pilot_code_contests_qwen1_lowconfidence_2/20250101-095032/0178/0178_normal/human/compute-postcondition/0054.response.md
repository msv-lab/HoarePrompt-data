The code snippet `col[i] += T[j][i]` updates the value of `col[i]` by adding the value of `T[j][i]` to it. However, the initial values of `col`, `i`, and `j` are not specified in the given initial state. Let's denote the initial value of `col[i]` as `C` and the initial value of `T[j][i]` as `T_val`.

The operation `col[i] += T[j][i]` modifies `col[i]` to become `C + T_val`. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col[i]` is `C + T_val`, `i` is `i`, `j` is `j`**
