The code snippet `lig[i] += T[i][j]` updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to it. However, since the initial values of `lig` and `T` are not specified, we can only state that `lig[i]` has been updated accordingly.

Output State: **`lig[i]` is now `lig[i] + T[i][j]`, and the values of `lig` and `T` for all other indices remain unchanged.**
