The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of n strings, where each string represents a row of an n × n board and contains n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is within the range [1, 100], and n is within the range [1, 30]. There is no explicit return value mentioned in the provided output cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a list of n strings representing an n × n board with specific constraints on the integers within the strings.
