The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state where `lig[0]` is `T[0][0]`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1, the code specifically adds the value of `T[0][1]` to `lig[0]`. Since initially `lig[0]` is `T[0][0]`, after adding `T[0][1]` to `lig[0]`, the new value of `lig[0]` will be `T[0][0] + T[0][1]`.

The states of the other variables (`i` and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`lig[0]` is `T[0][0] + T[0][1]`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
