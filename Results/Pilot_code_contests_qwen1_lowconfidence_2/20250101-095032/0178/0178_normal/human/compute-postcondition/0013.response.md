Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lig[0]` is `T[0][0]`
   - All other elements in `lig` are 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 0

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `j` should become 1.

5. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j`, the value of `lig[0]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged as the loop only increments `j`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `lig[0]` is still `T[0][0]`
   - All other elements in `lig` remain 0
   - `i` remains 0
   - `j` becomes 1

**State: **`lig[0]` is `T[0][0]`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
