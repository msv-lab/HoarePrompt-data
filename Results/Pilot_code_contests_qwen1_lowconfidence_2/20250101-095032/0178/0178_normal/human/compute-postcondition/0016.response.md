`lig[i]` is updated by adding `T[i][j]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `lig[0]` is `T[0][0] + T[0][1]`, and all other elements in `lig` are 0. The value of `i` is 0 and the value of `j` is 2. So, `lig[0]` will be updated to `T[0][0] + T[0][1] + T[0][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`lig[0]` is `T[0][0] + T[0][1] + T[0][2]`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
