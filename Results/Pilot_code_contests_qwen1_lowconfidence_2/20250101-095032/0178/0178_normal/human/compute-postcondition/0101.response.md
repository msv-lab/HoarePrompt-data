Functionality: **The function processes an \( n \times n \) board represented as a list of \( n \) strings, where each string contains \( n \) space-separated integers. It calculates the sum of each row and each column in the board. Then, it counts the number of times the sum of a column is greater than the sum of any row. If \( n \) is 0, the function does nothing and does not produce any output. If \( n \) is less than or equal to 30, the function prints the count of such instances.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n = 0 \), the function does not execute any operations and no output is produced.
- If the board contains invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, integers outside the range [1, 100]), the function will still proceed with the calculations using the valid integers, and the sums and comparisons will be based on those values.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle any error conditions such as non-numeric or out-of-range inputs explicitly. The code assumes that the input will always be valid, but it should ideally include error checking to ensure that all inputs are integers within the specified range.
