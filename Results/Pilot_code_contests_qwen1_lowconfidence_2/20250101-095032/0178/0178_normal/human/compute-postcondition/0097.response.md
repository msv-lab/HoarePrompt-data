Output State: **`col[0]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]` and incremented by 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `col[0]` is initialized to the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - `i` starts at `n + 1`.
   - `j` starts at `0` and iterates up to `n-1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `compt` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 each time `col[i] > lig[j]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range [0, n-1]. After each iteration, `j` increases by 1.
   - For each `j`, the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` is checked. If true, `compt` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `n`, as it starts from `0` and increments until it reaches `n-1` (inclusive).
   - `i` remains `n + 1` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `col[0]` retains its initial value, which is the sum of all elements `T[j][0]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1].
   - `compt` will be the count of indices `j` for which `col[0] > lig[j]`.

4. **No Further Execution**:
   - Once `j` reaches `n`, the loop terminates, and the values of the variables do not change further.

Thus, after the loop executes all iterations, the final state of the variables is as described above.
