`col[i]` is incremented by `T[j][i]`. However, the initial values of `col`, `i`, and `j` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `col[i]` has been updated by adding `T[j][i]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col[i]` is updated to `col[i] + T[j][i]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged**
