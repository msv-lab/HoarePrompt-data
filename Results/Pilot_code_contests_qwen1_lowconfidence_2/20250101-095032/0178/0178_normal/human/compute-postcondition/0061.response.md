The code initializes `compt` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `col[i]`, `i`, `j`, or `n`. The value of `compt` is now specifically 0.

Output State: **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is 0.**
