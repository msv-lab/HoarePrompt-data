Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `col[i]` is updated to `(col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]) + T[j][i]`.
   - `i` is unchanged.
   - `j` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Structure**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Current Iteration**: Since `j` is unchanged from the previous iteration, it means we are still within the same value of `j`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `j + 1`.

6. **State Adjustment**: 
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` will be incremented to `j + 1`.
   - `col[i]` will be updated again based on the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`col[i]` is updated to `(col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]) + T[j][i]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented to `j + 1`**.
