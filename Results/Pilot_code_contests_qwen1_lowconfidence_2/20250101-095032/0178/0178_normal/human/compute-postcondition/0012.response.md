The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state:
- `lig` is a list of \( n \) zeros.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is an integer.

Let's break down the steps:

1. `lig[0]` (since `i` is 0) is updated by adding `T[0][0]` to it.
2. Since `lig` initially contains \( n \) zeros, `lig[0]` is initially 0.
3. After the operation, `lig[0]` becomes `0 + T[0][0] = T[0][0]`.

Therefore, the new state is:
- `lig[0]` is now `T[0][0]`.
- All other elements in `lig` remain zero because no other elements were modified.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`lig[0]` is `T[0][0]`, all other elements in `lig` are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
