`col[i]` is updated to `col[i] + T[j][i]`. The original value of `col[i]` is `col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]`, so now `col[i]` is updated to `(col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]) + T[j][i]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the state of `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`col[i]` is updated to `(col[i] + T[j_end+1][i]) + T[j][i]`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged**
