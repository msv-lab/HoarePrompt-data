According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is unchanged, and `j` is incremented to `n`.

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be `i + 1` because `i` is unchanged from the previous iteration. Since `j` was incremented to `n` at the end of the loop, it does not affect the loop condition directly but indicates that the loop has processed all necessary values for `i`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`col[i+1]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i+1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `j` is incremented to `n`**
