The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` increments the value of `col[i]` by `T[j][i]`. Based on the initial state, `col[i]` was already equal to `C + T_val + T[j][i]`. Now, `T[j][i]` is added to this value.

So, the new value of `col[i]` will be:

\[ \text{col[i]} = (C + T_val + T[j][i]) + T[j][i] = C + T_val + 2 \cdot T[j][i] \]

Other variables remain unchanged: `j` is updated to `j + 2`, `i` remains the same, and `n` remains the same.

Output State: **`col[i]` is `C + T_val + 2 * T[j][i]`, `j` is `j + 2`, `i` is the same, `n` remains the same.**
