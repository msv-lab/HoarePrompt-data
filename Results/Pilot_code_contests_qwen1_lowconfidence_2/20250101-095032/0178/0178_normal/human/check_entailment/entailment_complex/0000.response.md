Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the size of the board \( n \) and then reads \( n \) lines of input, each containing \( n \) space-separated integers. This correctly handles the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D list `T` to store the board. This ensures that the board is properly initialized with the given input values.

3. **Row and Column Sums Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the sum of all elements in each row and stores these sums in the list `lig`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the sum of all elements in each column and stores these sums in the list `col`.

4. **Winning Squares Counting**:
   - The program iterates through each cell in the board and checks if the sum of the column (`col[i]`) is greater than the sum of the row (`lig[j]`). If so, it increments the counter `compt`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the count of winning squares.

The program correctly follows the logic required to determine the number of winning squares based on the sum comparison between columns and rows. It processes the board in a way that ensures all cells are checked, and it uses the sums calculated for rows and columns to make the determination for each cell.

Given that the program accurately performs all the necessary steps as outlined in the problem description, it is correct.
