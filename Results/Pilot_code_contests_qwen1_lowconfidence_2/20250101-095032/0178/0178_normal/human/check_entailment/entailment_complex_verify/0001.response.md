Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies the logical error in the program. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program incorrectly compares the column sum `col[i]` with the row sum `lig[j]` instead of `lig[i]`. This mismatch leads to incorrect results. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The expected output is 3, as all columns' sums are greater than their respective row sums. However, due to the mistake in the comparison, the program will incorrectly count only 2 winning squares. The correct comparisons should be made within the same row index `i` for `lig[i]` and the corresponding column index `j` for `col[j]`. Therefore, the program needs to be corrected to compare `col[j] > lig[i]` for each square to accurately determine the number of winning squares.
