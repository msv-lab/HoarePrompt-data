Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the integer `n` indicating the size of the board.
   - It then reads `n` rows of input, each containing `n` space-separated integers, and constructs a 2D list `T` representing the board.

2. **Row Sums Calculation (`lig`)**:
   - The program iterates through each row and calculates the sum of the elements in that row. These sums are stored in the list `lig`.

3. **Column Sums Calculation (`col`)**:
   - The program iterates through each column and calculates the sum of the elements in that column. These sums are stored in the list `col`.

4. **Winning Square Count (`compt`)**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the board and checks if the sum of the column containing the element is strictly greater than the sum of the row containing the element.
   - If this condition is met, it increments the counter `compt`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the count of winning squares.

The program correctly follows the problem description by:
- Calculating the sum of each row and storing it in `lig`.
- Calculating the sum of each column and storing it in `col`.
- Comparing these sums for each element to determine if it is a winning square.
- Outputting the total count of winning squares.

Thus, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description for all possible valid inputs within the specified constraints.
