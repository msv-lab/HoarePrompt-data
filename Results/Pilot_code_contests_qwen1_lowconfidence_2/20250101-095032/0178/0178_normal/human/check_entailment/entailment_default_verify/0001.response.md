Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has a logical error in the comparison between the column sum and row sum. Specifically, the program compares the column sum `col[i]` with the row sum `lig[j]` instead of `lig[i]`. This mismatch leads to incorrect results. According to the problem description and the output hints, the program should count the number of winning squares where the sum of the column is strictly greater than the sum of the row for each square. However, the current implementation does not perform this comparison correctly, as it uses the wrong index for the row sums. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
