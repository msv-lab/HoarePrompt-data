Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the program compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each cell, but it should compare the sum of the column with the sum of the row for the same cell. The current implementation incorrectly compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for different cells, which leads to incorrect results.

Based on the output hints and the provided problem description, the program needs to calculate the sum of the column and row for each cell and then compare these sums to determine if the cell is winning. The current implementation does not achieve this, hence the original assessment is accurate.
