You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

Note

In the first example two upper squares are winning.

In the third example three left squares in the both middle rows are winning:
    
    
    5 7 8 4  
    9 5 3 2  
    1 6 6 4  
    9 5 7 3  
    
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    lig = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
    col = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
    print(compt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the program compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each cell, but it should compare the sum of the column with the sum of the row for the same cell. The current implementation compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for different cells, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
5 7 8 4
9 5 3 2
1 6 6 4
9 5 7 3
```

The program should output `6`, as mentioned in the problem statement. However, due to the incorrect comparison logic, the program will produce an incorrect result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is given as a list of n strings, where each string represents a row of the n × n board and contains n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is within the range [1, 100], and n is within the range [1, 30].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[(0) for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is an `n x n` matrix where each element is an integer. For every row `i` (0 ≤ i < n), `T[i]` contains a list of integers `[int(a1), int(a2), ..., int(an)]`, where `a1, a2, ..., an` are the integers entered in the corresponding input lines during the loop iterations. The loop does not execute if `n` is 0.
    lig = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of matrix `T` for every `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and `n` is a positive integer.
    col = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer.
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `col[i]` is the sum of all elements `T[j][i]` for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of indices `j` for which `col[i] > lig[j]` for all `i` in the range [0, n-1].
    print(compt)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
