Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program is comparing the sum of the column with the sum of the row for different cells, rather than the same cell. Specifically, the inner loop for calculating `col` sums the elements of each column across all rows, while the inner loop for calculating `lig` sums the elements of each row across all columns. This means that when the program checks if `col[i] > lig[j]`, it is comparing the sum of the column `i` with the sum of the row `j`, which is not what the problem description requires.

The correct approach would be to compare the sum of the column containing the current cell with the sum of the row containing the same cell. However, the provided code does not implement this correctly. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct number of winning squares as per the problem description.
