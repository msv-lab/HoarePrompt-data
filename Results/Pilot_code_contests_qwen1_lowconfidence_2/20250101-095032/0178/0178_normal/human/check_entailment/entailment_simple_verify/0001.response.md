Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that there is a logical error in the comparison between the column sum and row sum. Specifically, the program compares `col[i] > lig[j]` instead of `col[j] > lig[i]`. This error leads to incorrect results as the program incorrectly counts the number of winning squares. The annotated version clearly shows that the nested loops for calculating the column sums (`col`) and row sums (`lig`) are correctly implemented, but the comparison in the final nested loop is flawed. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is supported by the annotations and the problem description.
