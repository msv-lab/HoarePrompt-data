Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the program compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each cell, but it should compare the sum of the column with the sum of the row for the same cell. The current implementation compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for different cells, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
5 7 8 4
9 5 3 2
1 6 6 4
9 5 7 3
```

The program should output `6`, as mentioned in the problem statement. However, due to the incorrect comparison logic, the program will produce an incorrect result.
