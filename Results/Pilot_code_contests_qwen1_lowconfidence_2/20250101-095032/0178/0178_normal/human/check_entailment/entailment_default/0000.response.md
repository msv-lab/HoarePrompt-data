Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine winning squares. Specifically, the code compares the sum of the column to the sum of any row instead of comparing it to the sum of the row containing the current square. This results in incorrect counts of winning squares. For example, consider the following input:

```
4
5 7 8 4
9 5 3 2
1 6 6 4
9 5 7 3
```

According to the problem description, we need to compare the sum of the column containing the current square with the sum of the row containing the current square. However, the code sums all rows and columns independently and then makes the comparison. This leads to incorrect results. For instance, in the top-left square (5), the column sum is 5 + 9 + 1 + 9 = 24, and the row sum is 5 + 7 + 8 + 4 = 24. Since 24 is not strictly greater than 24, the square should not be counted as winning according to the problem description, but the code would incorrectly count it as winning.
