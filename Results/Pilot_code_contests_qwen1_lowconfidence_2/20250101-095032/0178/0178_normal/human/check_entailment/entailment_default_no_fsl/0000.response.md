Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in the comparison between column sums and row sums. Specifically, the code compares `col[i]` (the sum of the ith column) with `lig[j]` (the sum of the jth row), which is incorrect according to the problem description. According to the problem, a square is winning if the sum of its column is strictly greater than the sum of its row. Therefore, the comparison should be between `col[i]` and `lig[i]`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in T]
    col_sums = [sum(col) for col in zip(*T)]
    
    winning_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if col_sums[i] > row_sums[j])
    
    print(winning_count)

```

This corrected version ensures that each element's column sum is compared with its row sum, which matches the problem description.
