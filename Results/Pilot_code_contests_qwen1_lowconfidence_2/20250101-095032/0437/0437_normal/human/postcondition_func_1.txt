The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Its primary action is to print the elements of the `args` tuple, separated by a space (`b' '`), to the standard output (`sys.stdout`). After the loop, it writes the `end` value (defaulting to `b'\n'`) and flushes the buffer if specified. However, the function is not designed to handle or process any keyword arguments other than `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'`. If these keyword arguments are present in the `kwargs` dictionary, they are ignored.
