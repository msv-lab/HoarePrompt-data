Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. Specifically, the `func_2` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and `func_1` does not handle the logic for calculating the minimal possible number of stones properly.

To fix this, the logic should ensure that the minimum number of stones is maintained, considering that removing a stone cannot result in a negative count. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '+':
            cnt += 1
        else:
            cnt -= 1
        if cnt < 0:
            cnt = 0
    print(cnt)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

This version correctly handles the logic and ensures that the minimal possible number of stones is calculated.
