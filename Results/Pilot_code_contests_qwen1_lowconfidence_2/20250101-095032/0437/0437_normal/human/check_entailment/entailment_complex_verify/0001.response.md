Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides more detail about the state of the program and the functions involved, but it still confirms that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The logic to calculate the minimal possible number of stones in the pile is flawed. The program only considers the final value of `cnt` without accounting for the maximum deficit encountered during the iterations. This means the initial number of stones is not correctly calculated to ensure the pile never becomes empty.

2. **Function `func_2`**: As noted in the annotation, `func_2` is not used in `func_1` to print the result. Instead, it should directly print the result. The use of `func_2` does not contribute to solving the problem and could potentially confuse the program's behavior.

Given the corrected version of the program is necessary to ensure the calculation of the minimal possible number of stones is accurate, the original program as provided still fails to meet the problem description correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid.
