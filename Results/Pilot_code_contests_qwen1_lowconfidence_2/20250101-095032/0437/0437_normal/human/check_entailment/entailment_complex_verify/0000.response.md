Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. Specifically:

1. The function `func_2` is not defined, and even if it were, it does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.
2. In `func_1`, the logic for calculating the minimal possible number of stones is flawed. The variable `cnt` is updated based on whether a "+" or "-" character is encountered, but it does not ensure that the count never goes below zero. Instead, it resets `cnt` to zero whenever it becomes negative, which does not reflect the requirement that the pile must remain non-empty before each removal operation.

Based on the annotations and the problem description, the program does not correctly maintain the invariant that the pile cannot become empty before a removal operation. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is correct.
