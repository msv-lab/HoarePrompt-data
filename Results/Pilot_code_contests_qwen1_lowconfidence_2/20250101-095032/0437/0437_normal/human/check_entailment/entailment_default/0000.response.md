Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after performing the given operations. The function `func_1` does not consider the initial number of stones in the pile, which is crucial for determining the minimum number of stones required.

The function `func_1` calculates the net change in the number of stones by counting the number of "+" (additions) minus the number of "-" (subtractions) in the string `s`. However, it does not account for the initial number of stones in the pile. The logic assumes that the pile starts with zero stones, which is not necessarily true according to the problem description.

To illustrate this, consider the following cases:

1. **Initial Number of Stones is 0**: If the initial number of stones is 0, and the sequence of operations results in a net count of 0 (equal number of additions and subtractions), the function will output 0, which is correct.

2. **Initial Number of Stones is Positive**: If the initial number of stones is positive, the function will still output 0, which is incorrect. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   3
   ---
   ```
   The function will output 0, assuming the pile starts with 0 stones, whereas the correct minimal number of stones would be 1 if the pile started with 1 stone.

Therefore, the function does not correctly handle cases where the initial number of stones is positive, leading to incorrect results. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
