Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code resets the count `cnt` to zero whenever it becomes negative, which is not necessary according to the problem description. The goal is to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations, not to reset the count to zero when it goes below zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
++-++
```

The expected output is `3`, as explained in the problem note. However, the current implementation would incorrectly set `cnt` to zero when it encounters the `-` character, resulting in an incorrect count.

To fix this, the code should not reset `cnt` to zero when it becomes negative. Instead, it should keep track of the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the iteration. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    min_cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        if cnt < min_cnt:
            min_cnt = cnt
    print(min_cnt)
```

This corrected version keeps track of the minimum count of stones in the pile, ensuring the result is the minimal possible number of stones after the operations.
