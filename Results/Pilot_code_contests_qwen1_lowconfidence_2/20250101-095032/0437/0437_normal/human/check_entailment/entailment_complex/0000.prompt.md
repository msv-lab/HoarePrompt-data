You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. n times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given n operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

Input

The first line contains one positive integer n — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The next line contains the string s, consisting of n symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on i-th operation, s_i is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, s_i is equal to "+" (without quotes).

Output

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these n operations.

Note

In the first test, if Vasya had 3 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 0. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is 0. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than 3, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 4. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making 4 operations the number of stones in the pile increases on 4 stones. So, the answer is 4.

In the third test, if Vasya had 1 stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 1. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `s` consists of "-" and "+" characters. It counts the number of "+" characters minus the number of "-" characters up to a point where the count becomes negative, at which point it resets the count to zero. After processing the entire string, it calls another function `func_2` with the final count as its argument. If the string is empty (`n` is 0), the initial count remains 0.

Otherwise, the buffer remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Its primary action is to print the elements of the `args` tuple, separated by a space (`b' '`), to the standard output (`sys.stdout`). After the loop, it writes the `end` value (defaulting to `b'\n'`) and flushes the buffer if specified. However, the function is not designed to handle or process any keyword arguments other than `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'`. If these keyword arguments are present in the `kwargs` dictionary, they are ignored.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
