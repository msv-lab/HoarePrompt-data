Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the pile is non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. 

According to the problem description, "The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile." However, the provided code does not enforce this condition. The variable `cnt` keeps track of the number of stones, and if `cnt` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. This means that if there are more "-" operations than "+" operations, `cnt` can become negative, indicating that the pile would have been empty before a "-‚Äù operation, which violates the problem constraints.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
The code will output `0`, which is correct in terms of minimizing the number of stones. However, it violates the constraint that the pile should never be empty before a "-" operation. The problem states that the pile should be non-empty before each "-" operation, which means the minimum number of stones at the start should be the number of "-" operations.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the pile is non-empty before each "-" operation. One way to achieve this is to keep track of the minimum value of `cnt` during the iteration and use that to determine the initial number of stones. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')
    cnt = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        min_stones = min(min_stones, cnt)
    
    # Ensure the pile is non-empty before each "-" operation
    initial_stones = max(0, -min_stones)
    func_2(initial_stones)
```

This ensures that the pile is non-empty before each "-" operation, thus meeting the problem description for every potential case.
