Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle the calculation of the initial number of stones needed to ensure the pile never becomes empty during the "-" operations. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of "+" and "-" operations but does not account for the minimum value of `cnt` during the iteration, which determines the initial number of stones required. Additionally, the function `func_2` is not used to print the result, and the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the initial number of stones is calculated correctly. The corrected version should directly print the result in `func_1` by calculating `-min_stones + 1`, where `min_stones` is the minimum value of `cnt` during the iteration.
