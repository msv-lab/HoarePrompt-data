Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the minimal number of stones, but it fails to initialize `cnt` correctly and does not account for the initial number of stones in the pile. Additionally, the `func_2` function, although its purpose is described, is not used in the provided program, and its implementation details do not affect the correctness of the main logic. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the output hints further confirm that the logic is flawed.
