Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, there are two main issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Possible Stones:**
   - The program calculates the `cnt` variable, which represents the net change in the number of stones after performing the operations. However, the final value of `cnt` does not directly give the minimum possible number of stones in the pile.
   - According to the problem description, the minimum possible number of stones should be the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the iteration plus one (since the pile was initially non-empty).

2. **Utility Function `func_2` Misuse:**
   - The function `func_2` is a utility function for printing values to a stream and is not related to solving the given problem. The program calls `func_2(cnt)` without any additional parameters, which implies that `func_2` should print `cnt` to the standard output. However, the implementation of `func_2` is incorrect and does not handle the expected input correctly.
   - The function `func_2` expects keyword arguments like `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, etc., but the program passes only `cnt` as a single argument, leading to unexpected behavior and possibly causing errors.

### Correct Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    max_cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt)
    
    # The minimum possible number of stones is max_cnt + 1
    print(max_cnt + 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Track Maximum Count (`max_cnt`):**
   - Instead of just calculating `cnt`, the solution keeps track of the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the iteration.
   
2. **Final Output:**
   - After the loop, the minimum possible number of stones in the pile is `max_cnt + 1`.

This ensures that the program correctly computes the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations.
