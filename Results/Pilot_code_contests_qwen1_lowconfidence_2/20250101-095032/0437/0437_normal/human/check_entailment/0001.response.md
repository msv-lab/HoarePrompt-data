Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` is not used to print the result, and the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the initial number of stones is calculated correctly.

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Number of Stones Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of "+" and "-" operations. However, it does not account for the initial number of stones in the pile, which must be at least the maximum deficit (i.e., the minimum value of `cnt` during the iteration plus one).

2. **Output**: The function `func_2` is defined but not used in `func_1`. Instead of using `func_2` to print the result, `func_1` should directly print the result.

To fix this, the program should:
- Calculate the initial number of stones required to ensure the pile never becomes empty during the "-" operations.
- Directly print the result in `func_1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    min_stones = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        if cnt < min_stones:
            min_stones = cnt
    print(-min_stones + 1)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the initial number of stones is correctly calculated and printed.
