Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` calculates the final count of stones in the pile but does not correctly determine the minimal possible number of stones initially needed to ensure the pile never becomes empty. The logic within the for loop updates `cnt` based on the operations but does not consider the initial number of stones. The variable `min_stones` is not updated correctly to reflect the minimum value of `cnt` during the iteration, which is necessary to determine the initial number of stones required. 

The annotated version clearly shows that `func_2` is not used in `func_1` to print the result, and the calculation of the initial number of stones is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment of **False** is correct.
