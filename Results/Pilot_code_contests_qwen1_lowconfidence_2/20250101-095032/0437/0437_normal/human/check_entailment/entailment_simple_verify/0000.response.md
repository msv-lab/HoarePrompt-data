Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program as written does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. Specifically:

1. The `func_2` function is not defined in the provided code, which means the program would fail to execute without this function.
2. Even though `func_1` attempts to calculate the minimal possible number of stones, it does so incorrectly. The logic within the `for` loop increments `cnt` only when encountering a `'+'` and decrements it when encountering a `'-'`. However, it sets `cnt` to 0 if it becomes negative, which is not necessary for finding the minimal possible number of stones. The minimal number of stones is simply the value of `cnt` after processing the entire string `s`.

Given the corrected logic should be:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '+':
            cnt += 1
        else:
            cnt -= 1
    print(cnt)
```
The provided code lacks the final `print(cnt)` statement, which is necessary to output the result. Therefore, even with the corrections, the program would still fail to meet the problem requirements due to the missing `print` statement.

Thus, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
