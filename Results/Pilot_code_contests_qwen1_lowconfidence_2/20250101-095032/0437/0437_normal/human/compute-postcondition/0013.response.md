`at_start` is reassigned to `False`. Since this is just reassigning the value of `at_start` and no other variables are affected, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least two elements, and `sys.stdout` content includes `b' ' + str(x)**
