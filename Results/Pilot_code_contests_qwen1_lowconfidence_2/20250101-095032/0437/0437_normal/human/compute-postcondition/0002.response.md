The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys; `sep` is `b' '`; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys; `sep` is `b' '`; `file` is `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`**
