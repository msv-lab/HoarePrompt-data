Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Its primary action is to print the elements of the `args` tuple, separated by a space (`b' '`), to the standard output (`sys.stdout`). After the loop, it writes the `end` value (defaulting to `b'\n'`) and flushes the buffer if specified. However, the function is not designed to handle or process any keyword arguments other than `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'`. If these keyword arguments are present in the `kwargs` dictionary, they are ignored.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `args` is empty, nothing will be printed.
- If `kwargs` contains keys other than `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'`, those keys are ignored.
- If `kwargs['flush']` is set to `True`, the buffer will be flushed; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not modify or use any of the keyword arguments other than `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'`. Any other keyword arguments passed to the function are ignored.
