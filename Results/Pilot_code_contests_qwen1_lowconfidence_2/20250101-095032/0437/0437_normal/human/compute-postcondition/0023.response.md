Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep', 'file', and 'end' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least one element, `sys.stdout` content is the original concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'`, and `sys.stdout` buffer is flushed if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is explicitly set to `True`. Otherwise, the buffer remains unchanged.***
