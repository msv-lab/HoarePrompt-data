According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `args` list. The loop can execute again if there are more elements left in `args`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `at_start` is `False`
- `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys
- `sep` is `b' '` (this value will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body)
- `file` is `sys.stdout` (this value will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body)
- `args` must have at least one element (and since we are at the end of an iteration, it means `args` had at least one element before this iteration)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `args` must have at least two elements (since the current element `x` was just processed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least two elements**
