The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `b' '` according to the initial state) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). Since no other variables are affected, the output state will include the updated value of `file` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys; `sep` is `b' '`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must have at least one element; `file` is `sys.stdout` and a space (`b' '` is written to `sys.stdout`)**
