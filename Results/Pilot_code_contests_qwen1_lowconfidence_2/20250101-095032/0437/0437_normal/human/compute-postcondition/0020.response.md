The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` impacts the following variables:

1. `kwargs`: It originally does not contain the 'sep' and 'file' keys. After executing the code, it will not contain the 'sep', 'file', and 'end' keys.
2. `file`: It is set to `sys.stdout`.
3. `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`: This line removes the 'end' key from `kwargs` and writes its value (which is `b'\n'` by default) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`).

Since `kwargs` no longer contains the 'sep' and 'file' keys, the only change is that `kwargs` will now also not contain the 'end' key. The value written to `sys.stdout` is `b'\n'`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep', 'file', and 'end' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least one element, and `sys.stdout` content is the original concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `b' '` followed by `b'\n'`.**
