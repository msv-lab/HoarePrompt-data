`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `b' '`), to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). The `write` method does not return a value, but it changes the content written to `sys.stdout`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least two elements, `sys.stdout` content includes `b' '`.**
