The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, the value `b' '` (which was present in `sys.stdout` content) will be followed by the string representation of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `at_start` is `False`
- `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys
- `sep` is `b' '`
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `args` must have at least two elements
- `sys.stdout` content includes `b' '` because the condition `not at_start` evaluates to true

After executing `file.write(str(x))`, the content of `sys.stdout` will include `b' '` followed by the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least two elements, and `sys.stdout` content includes `b' ' + str(x)**
