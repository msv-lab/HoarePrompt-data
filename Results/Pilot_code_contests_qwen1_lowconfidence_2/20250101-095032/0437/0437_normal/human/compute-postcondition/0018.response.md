The variable `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `sys.stdout`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least one element, and `sys.stdout` content is `b' ' + str(next_x) + str(x)**
