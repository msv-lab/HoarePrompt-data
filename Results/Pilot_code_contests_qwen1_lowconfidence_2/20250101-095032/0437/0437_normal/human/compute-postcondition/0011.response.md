Postcondition: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must have at least two elements, and `sys.stdout` content includes `b' '` since the condition `not at_start` evaluates to true, ensuring the postcondition remains consistent with the if part.**
