The function processes a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `s` consists of "-" and "+" characters. It counts the number of "+" characters minus the number of "-" characters up to a point where the count becomes negative, at which point it resets the count to zero. After processing the entire string, it calls another function `func_2` with the final count as its argument. If the string is empty (`n` is 0), the initial count remains 0.
