The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It writes the string representation of `n` followed by a newline character to the standard output (stdout). After executing the function, the standard output will contain the string representation of `n` on a new line. There are no return values from this function; it only modifies the standard output.
