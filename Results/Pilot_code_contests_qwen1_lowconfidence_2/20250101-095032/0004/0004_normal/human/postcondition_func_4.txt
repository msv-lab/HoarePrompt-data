The function `func_5()` reads a sequence of space-separated integers from the standard input (`stdin`). It then converts these integers into a map object. The map object contains the integer values corresponding to the input integers. This function assumes that the first integer read from `stdin` represents the count `n` of subsequent integers, and these `n` integers follow. The function does not validate the input values or handle any potential errors during the reading process.
