The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user, which represents the size of the permutation (n). This integer must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the integer input provided by the user. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code does not contain any additional functionality beyond reading the user input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the integer input from the user, ensuring it falls within the specified range.
