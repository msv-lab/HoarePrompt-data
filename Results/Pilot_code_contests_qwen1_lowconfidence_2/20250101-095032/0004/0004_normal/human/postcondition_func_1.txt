The function `func_2` reads a space-separated sequence of integers from the standard input stream, converts them into a tuple of integers, and returns this tuple. The function accepts no parameters and returns a tuple of integers. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, in which case the program will raise a `ValueError`. The function also assumes that the input format is strictly adhered to, meaning exactly two space-separated integers are expected (one for `n` and the rest for the list `s`). If the input format deviates from this expectation, the function may produce unexpected results or raise exceptions.
