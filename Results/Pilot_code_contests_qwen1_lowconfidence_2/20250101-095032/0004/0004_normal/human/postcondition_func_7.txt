The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` and returns an integer. The function iterates over a range of powers of 2 from \(2^{21}\) down to \(2^{-1}\) (inclusive), checking if adding each power of 2 to the current value of `ret` and its corresponding BITTree value to `sm` keeps `sm` within the limit `x`. If both conditions are met, it updates `ret` and `sm`. After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `ret`. If no updates were made to `ret` during the loop, the function returns 0.
