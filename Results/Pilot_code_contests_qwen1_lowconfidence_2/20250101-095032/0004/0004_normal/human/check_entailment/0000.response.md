Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions defined in the program do not contribute to solving the permutation restoration problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, and `func_8` do not contain any logic that processes the input `s` to reconstruct the permutation `p`.

The problem requires constructing a permutation based on the given sums `s_i`, but the provided code does not include any implementation of this logic. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
