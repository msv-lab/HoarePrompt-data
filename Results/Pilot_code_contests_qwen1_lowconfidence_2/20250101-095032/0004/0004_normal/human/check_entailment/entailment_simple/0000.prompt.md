You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline

l = func_2()
for i in range(n):
    func_7(i, i)

    ans[i] = func_8(l[i])
    func_7(ans[i], -ans[i])

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, but the function reads an integer input from the user, which represents the size of the permutation (n), and this integer is expected to be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user, which represents the size of the permutation (n) and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_2` are defined in its signature. The function reads input from the standard input stream, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers corresponding to the values of `n` and the list `s`. The function returns a tuple of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns a tuple of integers obtained from the space-separated sequence of integers read from the standard input stream

def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n integers representing the values of s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, where n is the size of the permutation and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each element in the list satisfies 0 ≤ s_i ≤ (n(n-1))/2, and the list corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin is a file-like object containing space-separated integers for n and s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ (n(n-1))/2 for all i.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the space-separated integers read from stdin into integers

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 <= i <= n, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) representing the cumulative sums of some array up to index n.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is the sum of all elements in the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) up to the initial value of `i`, `i` is 0, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree representing the cumulative sums of some array up to index `n`.
    return s
    #The program returns `s`, which is the sum of all elements in the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) up to the initial value of `i`, where `i` is 0

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i <= n, and v is an integer representing the value to be added to the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) at index i.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the next highest position in the binary representation of the original `i` where `0 < i <= n`; `BITTree[i]` is updated to its original value plus `v`; `n` remains unchanged; `v` is the integer value that was added to the BITTree initially.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n * (n - 1)) // 2, n is an integer greater than 0, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) initialized with zeros and has at least n elements.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sm` is the sum of all `BITTree[ret + pw]` values where `pw` is \(2^i\) and `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x\), `ret` is the cumulative sum of all `pw` added during the loop iterations, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `pw` is \(2^{-1}\) (indicating the loop has finished). If the loop does not execute at all, then `sm` and `ret` remain 0.
    return ret
    #The program returns 0


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
