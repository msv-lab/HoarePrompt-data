Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to restore the permutation based on the given sums `s_i`. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `s` using `func_1` and `func_2`, respectively. These functions handle the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**: The code uses a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to maintain the cumulative sums. Functions `func_7` and `func_6` correctly update and query the BIT, respectively. This ensures that the sums `s_i` can be efficiently managed and queried.

3. **Restoring Permutation**: The `func_8` function correctly restores the permutation by finding the appropriate index `p_i` that fits the given sum `s_i`. The logic in `func_8` iteratively determines the smallest possible value for `p_i` that maintains the cumulative sum constraints, ensuring that each value is placed in the correct position.

4. **Output**: The restored permutation is correctly printed using `func_4`, which formats and outputs the result as specified.

Given the structure and the functionality of the provided code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
