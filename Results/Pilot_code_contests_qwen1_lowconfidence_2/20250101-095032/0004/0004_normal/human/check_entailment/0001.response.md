Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given problem description. Instead, it appears to be a collection of placeholder functions and some bitwise operations, which do not relate to the problem at hand. 

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to iterate through the `s` array and reconstruct the permutation by ensuring that for each index `i`, the sum of all elements before `i` that are smaller than `p_i` matches `s_i`. The provided code does not contain any logic to achieve this. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
