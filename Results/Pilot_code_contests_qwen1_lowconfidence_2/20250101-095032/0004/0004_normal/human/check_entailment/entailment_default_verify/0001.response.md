Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the logic to restore the permutation based on the given problem description. The code includes several placeholder functions and bitwise operations that are not related to solving the problem. Specifically, the function `func_8` is intended to find a value based on a Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree), but it does not fit the context of the problem. The problem requires constructing a permutation based on the given sums (`s_i`), which is not addressed by the current implementation. Therefore, the program is still incorrect.
