Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input permutation is not strictly increasing, which is a requirement according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_8` is designed to find the smallest integer that fits the criteria given the current state of the BITTree, but it does not ensure that the resulting permutation is strictly increasing.

To illustrate, consider the input:

```
n = 3
s = [0, 1, 2]
```

The problem description requires that the permutation is strictly increasing, meaning each element must be larger than all previous elements. However, the code might produce a permutation that is not strictly increasing, such as `[3, 2, 1]`.

Let's break down why this happens:

1. **Initial State**: The BITTree is initialized with zeros.
2. **Processing `s[1]` (value 1)**: 
   - `func_8(1)` will find the smallest integer that fits the criteria. Since `s[1] = 1`, the smallest integer that can satisfy this is `2` (since `1` would not increase the sum).
3. **Processing `s[2]` (value 2)**:
   - `func_8(2)` will find the smallest integer that fits the criteria. Since `s[2] = 2`, the smallest integer that can satisfy this is `3` (since `2` would not increase the sum).

Thus, the code might produce the permutation `[2, 3, 1]`, which is not strictly increasing.

This shows that the code does not correctly restore a strictly increasing permutation for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
