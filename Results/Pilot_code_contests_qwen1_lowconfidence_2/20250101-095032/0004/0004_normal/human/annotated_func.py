#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, but the function reads an integer input from the user, which represents the size of the permutation (n), and this integer is expected to be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user, which represents the size of the permutation (n) and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user, which represents the size of the permutation (n). This integer must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the integer input provided by the user. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code does not contain any additional functionality beyond reading the user input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the integer input from the user, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_2` are defined in its signature. The function reads input from the standard input stream, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers corresponding to the values of `n` and the list `s`. The function returns a tuple of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns a tuple of integers obtained from the space-separated sequence of integers read from the standard input stream
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a space-separated sequence of integers from the standard input stream, converts them into a tuple of integers, and returns this tuple. The function accepts no parameters and returns a tuple of integers. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, in which case the program will raise a `ValueError`. The function also assumes that the input format is strictly adhered to, meaning exactly two space-separated integers are expected (one for `n` and the rest for the list `s`). If the input format deviates from this expectation, the function may produce unexpected results or raise exceptions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It writes the string representation of `n` followed by a newline character to the standard output (stdout). After executing the function, the standard output will contain the string representation of `n` on a new line. There are no return values from this function; it only modifies the standard output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n integers representing the values of s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, where n is the size of the permutation and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each element in the list satisfies 0 ≤ s_i ≤ (n(n-1))/2, and the list corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a list `arr` as input and checks if it meets the conditions for a valid permutation. If `arr` is a valid permutation, it returns the list `arr`. Otherwise, it prints an error message indicating that the input does not meet the conditions for a valid permutation. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the error message is printed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin is a file-like object containing space-separated integers for n and s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ (n(n-1))/2 for all i.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the space-separated integers read from stdin into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` reads a sequence of space-separated integers from the standard input (`stdin`). It then converts these integers into a map object. The map object contains the integer values corresponding to the input integers. This function assumes that the first integer read from `stdin` represents the count `n` of subsequent integers, and these `n` integers follow. The function does not validate the input values or handle any potential errors during the reading process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 <= i <= n, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) representing the cumulative sums of some array up to index n.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is the sum of all elements in the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) up to the initial value of `i`, `i` is 0, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree representing the cumulative sums of some array up to index `n`.
    return s
    #The program returns `s`, which is the sum of all elements in the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) up to the initial value of `i`, where `i` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts an integer `i` such that 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`, where `n` is the size of the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree). It calculates the sum of all elements in the BITTree up to the index corresponding to the initial value of `i`. This is achieved through a bitwise operation to traverse the tree efficiently. The function then returns this sum. If `i` is 1 initially, the function effectively returns the sum of all elements in the BITTree. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns `s`, which is the sum of all elements in the BITTree up to the initial value of `i`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i <= n, and v is an integer representing the value to be added to the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) at index i.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the next highest position in the binary representation of the original `i` where `0 < i <= n`; `BITTree[i]` is updated to its original value plus `v`; `n` remains unchanged; `v` is the integer value that was added to the BITTree initially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `i` and `v`, where `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i \leq n\) and `v` is an integer. It updates the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) by adding `v` to the element at index `i` and all subsequent indices `j` where `j` is a multiple of the least significant bit of `i`. After executing the function, the BITTree will have the value `v` added to the elements at indices `i`, `i + lsb(i)`, `i + 2*lsb(i)`, and so on, up to the largest multiple of `lsb(i)` that does not exceed `n`. If `i` is greater than `n`, no changes are made to the BITTree.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n * (n - 1)) // 2, n is an integer greater than 0, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) initialized with zeros and has at least n elements.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sm` is the sum of all `BITTree[ret + pw]` values where `pw` is \(2^i\) and `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x\), `ret` is the cumulative sum of all `pw` added during the loop iterations, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `pw` is \(2^{-1}\) (indicating the loop has finished). If the loop does not execute at all, then `sm` and `ret` remain 0.
    return ret
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` and returns an integer. The function iterates over a range of powers of 2 from \(2^{21}\) down to \(2^{-1}\) (inclusive), checking if adding each power of 2 to the current value of `ret` and its corresponding BITTree value to `sm` keeps `sm` within the limit `x`. If both conditions are met, it updates `ret` and `sm`. After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `ret`. If no updates were made to `ret` during the loop, the function returns 0.
