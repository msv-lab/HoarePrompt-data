The code `sm += BITTree[ret]` updates the value of `sm` by adding the value of `BITTree[ret]` to it. Given the initial state, `ret` is `ret + 2 * pw`. Since `pw` is \(2^{19}\), we can substitute this into the equation:

- Initially, `ret` was `ret + 2 * pw`.
- Now, `ret` is updated to `ret + 2 * pw`.

Since `ret` is `ret + 2 * pw`, substituting this in the code gives us `sm += BITTree[ret + 2 * pw]`. This matches the initial state's definition of `ret`.

The value of `sm` is updated, but the exact value depends on the value of `BITTree[ret + 2 * pw]`. However, we know that `sm` was previously `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]`, so the new value of `sm` is `sm + BITTree[ret + 2 * pw]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `sm` is now `sm + BITTree[ret + 2 * pw]`.
- `ret` is `ret + 2 * pw`.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 19.
- `pw` is \(2^{19}\).

Output State: **`sm` is `sm + BITTree[ret + 2 * pw]`, `ret` is `ret + 2 * pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 19, `pw` is \(2^{19}\)**
