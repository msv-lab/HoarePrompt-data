The code snippet `pw = 1 << i` shifts the bit of `1` left by `i` positions. Given that `i` is 20, `pw` will be \(2^{20}\), not \(2^{21}\) as mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Initial State: `sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 20, and `pw` remains \(2^{21}\).

2. The code snippet `pw = 1 << i` changes the value of `pw` from \(2^{21}\) (which was the initial state) to \(2^{20}\). 

3. The other variables (`sm`, `ret`, `x`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.

Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 20, and `pw` is \(2^{20}\).

Output State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 20, and `pw` is \(2^{20}\)**.
