Postcondition: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 19, `pw` is \(2^{19}\). If `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x` holds true, then `sm` becomes `sm + BITTree[ret + 2 * pw]` and `ret` becomes `ret + 2 * pw`. Otherwise, the values of `sm` and `ret` remain as they were after the initial update.**
