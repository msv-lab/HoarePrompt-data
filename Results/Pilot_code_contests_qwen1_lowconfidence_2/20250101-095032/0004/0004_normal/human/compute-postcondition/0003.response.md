The code `pw = 1 << i` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions, which in this case is 21. Shifting 1 left by 21 positions results in \(2^{21}\).

- `sm` remains unchanged and is still 0.
- `x` remains unchanged and is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\).
- `ret` remains unchanged and is still 0.
- `i` is set to 21, and `pw` is now \(2^{21}\).

Output State: **`sm` is 0, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), `ret` is 0, `i` is 21, `pw` is \(2^{21}\)**
