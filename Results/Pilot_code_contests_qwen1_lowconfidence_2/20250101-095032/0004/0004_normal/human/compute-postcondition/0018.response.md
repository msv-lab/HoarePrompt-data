Output State: **`sm` is the sum of all `BITTree[ret + pw]` values where `pw` is \(2^i\) and `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x\), `ret` is the cumulative sum of all `pw` added during the loop iterations, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `pw` is \(2^{-1}\) (indicating the loop has finished). If the loop does not execute at all, then `sm` and `ret` remain 0.**
