Functionality: **The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` and returns an integer. The function iterates over a range of powers of 2 from \(2^{21}\) down to \(2^{-1}\) (inclusive), checking if adding each power of 2 to the current value of `ret` and its corresponding BITTree value to `sm` keeps `sm` within the limit `x`. If both conditions are met, it updates `ret` and `sm`. After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `ret`. If no updates were made to `ret` during the loop, the function returns 0.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the function will return 0.
- If the BITTree contains all zeros, the loop will not execute, and the function will return 0.
- If `x` is very large, the loop might still not find a valid `ret` value that satisfies the conditions, resulting in the function returning 0.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not update the BITTree in any way. It only reads from it.
- The function does not modify the input `x`.
