The code `sm += BITTree[ret]` updates the variable `sm` by adding the value of `BITTree[ret]` to it. Let's analyze the impact:

- Initially, `sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`.
- `ret` is `ret + 2 * pw`.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 20.
- `pw` is \(2^{20}\).

After executing the code `sm += BITTree[ret]`:

- `sm` is updated to its current value plus the value of `BITTree[ret]`.
- `ret` is updated to `ret + 2 * pw`.
- The value of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.

Since `ret` was previously `ret + 2 * pw`, the new value of `ret` is now `ret + 2 * pw + 2 * pw = ret + 4 * pw`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]` plus `BITTree[ret + 4 * pw]`, `ret` is `ret + 4 * pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 20, and `pw` is \(2^{20}\)**.
