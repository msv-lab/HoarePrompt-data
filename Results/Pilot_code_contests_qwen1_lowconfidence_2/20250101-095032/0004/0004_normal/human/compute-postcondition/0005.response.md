The code `ret += pw` increments the value of `ret` by `pw`. Given that `pw` is \(2^{21}\), the value of `ret` will be updated accordingly. No other variables are affected by this operation.

The initial state is:
- `sm` is 0
- `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `ret` is 0
- `i` is 21
- `pw` is \(2^{21}\)
- `ret` plus `pw` is less than or equal to `n`
- `sm` plus `BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`

After executing `ret += pw`, the value of `ret` will be `pw`, which is \(2^{21}\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` is 0, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), `ret` is \(2^{21}\), `i` is 21, `pw` is \(2^{21}\), `ret` plus `pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and `sm` plus `BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`**
