The variable `ret` is assigned the value `0`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `x` remains an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), and the BITTree remains initialized with zeros.

Output State: **x is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), n is an integer greater than 0, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) initialized with zeros and has at least n elements; `ret` is 0.**
