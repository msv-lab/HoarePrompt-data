The code `ret += pw` increments the value of `ret` by `pw`. Given that `ret` was initially `ret + pw` and `pw` is \(2^{19}\), the new value of `ret` will be the sum of its previous value and \(2^{19}\). The other variables (`sm`, `x`, `i`, and `pw`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`
- `ret` is now `(ret + pw) + pw`, which simplifies to `ret + 2 * pw`
- `x` remains unchanged
- `i` is 19
- `pw` is \(2^{19}\)

Output State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + 2 * pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 19, `pw` is \(2^{19}\)**
