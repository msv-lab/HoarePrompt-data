The code updates `sm` by adding the value of `BITTree[ret]`. Given the initial conditions, `sm` was 0. After executing `sm += BITTree[ret]`, the value of `sm` will be `BITTree[ret]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), `ret` is \(2^{21}\), `i` is 21, `pw` is \(2^{21}\), `ret` plus `pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]` is less than or equal to `x`.

Output State: **`sm` is `BITTree[ret]`, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), `ret` is \(2^{21}\), `i` is 21, `pw` is \(2^{21}\), `ret` plus `pw` is less than or equal to `n`, and `sm` plus `BITTree[ret]` is less than or equal to `x`**.
