Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`.
   - `ret` is `ret + pw`.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains 21.
   - `pw` remains \(2^{21}\).
   - If `ret + pw` exceeds `n` or `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` exceeds `x`, the values of `sm`, `ret`, and `x` remain unchanged.

2. **Current Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(21, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from 21 down to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1.
   - At each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.
   - The loop condition is `i >= -1`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` was 21 at the end of the previous iteration and the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be 20.
   - The other variables (`sm`, `ret`, `x`, and `pw`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` is 20 and the loop will continue as long as `i >= -1`, the loop can execute one more time.
   - All other variables (`sm`, `ret`, `x`, and `pw`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 20, and `pw` remains \(2^{21}\)**.
