Postcondition: ***`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 20, and `pw` is \(2^{20}\). If `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, then `sm` is further updated to include `BITTree[ret + 4 * pw]` and `ret` is updated to `ret + 4 * pw`. Otherwise, the values of `sm` and `ret` remain as they were after the initial update.***
