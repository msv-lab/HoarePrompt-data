The code snippet initializes the variable `sm` to 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged because no operation involving `x` is performed. Similarly, the value of `ret` remains 0 since it is not involved in any operations. The precondition regarding the BITTree and the range of `x` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` is 0, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), `ret` is 0.**
