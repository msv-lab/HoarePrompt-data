The code `pw = 1 << i` shifts the value of `1` left by `i` positions. Given the initial state where `i` is 19, this operation will shift `1` left by 19 positions, resulting in `2^19`. 

- The initial value of `pw` is \(2^{20}\).
- After executing `pw = 1 << i`, the new value of `pw` will be \(2^{19}\).

The other variables (`sm`, `ret`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 19, `pw` is \(2^{19}\)**
