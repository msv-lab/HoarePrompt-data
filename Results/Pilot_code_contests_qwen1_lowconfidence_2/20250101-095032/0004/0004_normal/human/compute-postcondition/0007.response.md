Postcondition: ***`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` remains 21, and `pw` remains \(2^{21}\). If `ret + pw` exceeds `n` or `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` exceeds `x`, the values of `sm`, `ret`, and `x` remain as they were before the if statement.***
