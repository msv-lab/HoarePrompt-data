The code `ret += pw` increments the value of `ret` by the value of `pw`. Given the initial state, `pw` is \(2^{20}\). The initial value of `ret` is `ret + pw`, which means `ret` was already increased by \(2^{20}\) before this line of code. Therefore, adding `pw` again will double the value of `ret`.

- `sm` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `sm`.
- `x` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `x`.
- `i` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `i`.
- `pw` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `pw`.
- `ret` is updated to its previous value plus \(2^{20}\).

Given the initial state, the value of `ret` before this line of code was `ret + pw`. After executing `ret += pw`, `ret` becomes `(ret + pw) + pw`, which simplifies to `ret + 2 * pw`.

Output State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + 2 * pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 20, and `pw` is \(2^{20}\)**
