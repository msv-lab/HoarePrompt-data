According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `21 >= i` holds true. The initial values of `sm`, `x`, and `ret` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. Instead, we need to ensure that the loop variable `i` satisfies the condition for the loop to start.

The loop will start with `i = 21` and decrement by 1 until `i` becomes less than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[21, 0]`.

Since the loop starts with `i = 21` and decrements, the initial value of `i` must be set to 21 for the loop to begin executing.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will start when `i` is 21 and will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. The initial value of `i` should be set to 21 for the loop to start.
3. The values of `sm`, `x`, and `ret` do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to include the initial value of `i`.

State: **`sm` is 0, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\), `ret` is 0, `i` is 21**
