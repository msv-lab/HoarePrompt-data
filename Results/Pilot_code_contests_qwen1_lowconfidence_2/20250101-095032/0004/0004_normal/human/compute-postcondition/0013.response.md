Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`.
- `ret` is `ret + pw`.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 20.
- `pw` is \(2^{20}\).

The conditions for the loop to continue are:
- `ret + pw <= n` and
- `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`.

If these conditions are met, then:
- `sm` is further updated to include `BITTree[ret + 4 * pw]`.
- `ret` is updated to `ret + 4 * pw`.

Otherwise, the values of `sm` and `ret` remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `i` is 20.
   - `pw` is \(2^{20}\).
   - `ret` and `sm` have been updated based on the previous condition check.
   - `x` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from 21 to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order. 

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 20.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be 19.

4. **Conditions to Check**:
   - We need to check if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`.
   - If these conditions are true, we need to update `sm` and `ret` accordingly.

5. **Update Values**:
   - If the conditions are met, `sm` will be updated to include `BITTree[ret + 4 * pw]`.
   - `ret` will be updated to `ret + 4 * pw`.

6. **No Update**:
   - If the conditions are not met, `sm` and `ret` remain the same as they were after the initial update.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
- `i` will be 19.
- The values of `sm` and `ret` will either be updated or remain the same based on the conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 19, and `pw` is \(2^{20}\)**.

If the conditions are met, the values of `sm` and `ret` will be updated accordingly. If not, they will remain the same as they were after the initial update.

Thus, the final state before the next iteration is:

State: **`sm` is the sum of `sm` and `BITTree[ret + pw]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is 19, and `pw` is \(2^{20}\)**.
