The function `func_4` takes a list `arr` as input and checks if it meets the conditions for a valid permutation. If `arr` is a valid permutation, it returns the list `arr`. Otherwise, it prints an error message indicating that the input does not meet the conditions for a valid permutation. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the error message is printed.
