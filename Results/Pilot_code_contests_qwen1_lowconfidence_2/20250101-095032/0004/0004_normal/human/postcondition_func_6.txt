The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `i` and `v`, where `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i \leq n\) and `v` is an integer. It updates the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) by adding `v` to the element at index `i` and all subsequent indices `j` where `j` is a multiple of the least significant bit of `i`. After executing the function, the BITTree will have the value `v` added to the elements at indices `i`, `i + lsb(i)`, `i + 2*lsb(i)`, and so on, up to the largest multiple of `lsb(i)` that does not exceed `n`. If `i` is greater than `n`, no changes are made to the BITTree.
