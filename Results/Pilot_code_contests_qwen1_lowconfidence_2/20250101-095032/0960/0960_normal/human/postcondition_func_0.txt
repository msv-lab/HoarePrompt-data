The function `func()` takes three parameters: `n` (number of servers), `m` (number of direct connections), and `v` (index of the failing server). It constructs a network of servers connected by direct links under certain conditions and then reconfigures the network after the failure of one server. Specifically, the function first checks if the number of direct connections is sufficient for a fully connected network minus one server (i.e., \(m \geq n-1\)). If not, it prints `-1` and exits. Otherwise, it builds an initial set of direct connections between servers and further adds additional connections to ensure the remaining direct connections are used up. If any direct connections are still left over after the initial setup, it prints `-1` and exits. Finally, it reorders the server indices to reflect the failure of server `v` and prints out the new configuration of direct connections between the servers.
