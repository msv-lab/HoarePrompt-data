`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. Since `node2_nr` was less than `n` and `n` is greater than 10, `node2_nr` was originally a value between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive). After incrementing by 1, `node2_nr` is now a value between 1 (inclusive) and 11 (exclusive).

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `edges`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `node2_nr` is a value between 1 and 11 (exclusive), `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
