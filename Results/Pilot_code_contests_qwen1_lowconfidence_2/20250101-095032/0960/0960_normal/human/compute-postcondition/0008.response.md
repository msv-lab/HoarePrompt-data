Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `m > 0 and node1_nr < n`.

2. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is an integer less than `n - 1 - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `m < 1`.
   - `v` is an integer (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `edges` is a list of tuples representing edges in a graph, but it's not relevant to the loop condition.
   - `node1_nr` is 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions must be true: `m > 0` and `node1_nr < n`.
   - From the current state, `node1_nr` is 1, so `node1_nr < n` is already satisfied because `n` is an integer and greater than 1 (since `m` is less than 1, `n` must be at least 2).
   - However, `m > 0` is not satisfied because `m` is less than 1.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - To satisfy the condition `m > 0`, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `m` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list of tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1))], `node1_nr` is 1**
