Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States:
- `n` is greater than 10
- `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1
- `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`
- `node2_nr` is increased by 1

### Loop Condition:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
   
2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1.
   - `node2_nr` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
   
3. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `node2_nr` must still be less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`m`**: Since `m` is greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1, for the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 0. This means `m` should be greater than or equal to 1.
- **`node2_nr`**: Since `node2_nr` has been increased by 1, for the loop to continue, `node2_nr` must still be less than `n`.

### Final State:

The state needs to be modified to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect these conditions:

State: **`n` is greater than 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `node2_nr` is less than `n`**
