`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. Initially, `m` was greater than 0 and now equals `m - 1`, so `node2_nr` was less than `n` and is now `m`. The value of `n` remains greater than 10, and the list `edges` still contains one more tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`. The state of the other variables is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10; `m` is greater than 0 and now equals `m - 1`; `node2_nr` is `m + 1`; `edges` is a list containing one more tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
