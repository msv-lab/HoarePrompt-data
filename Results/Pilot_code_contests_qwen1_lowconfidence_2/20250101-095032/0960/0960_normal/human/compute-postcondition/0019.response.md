The code appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state, `node2_nr` is `node2_nr` (its original value plus 1) and must be less than `n`. The value of `m` is not directly used in this code snippet, so it remains at least 2.

After executing the code, the list `edges` will contain the new tuple, and the value of `node2_nr` will be updated to its original value plus 1, ensuring it is still less than `n`.

Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1 and must be less than `n`, and the list `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
