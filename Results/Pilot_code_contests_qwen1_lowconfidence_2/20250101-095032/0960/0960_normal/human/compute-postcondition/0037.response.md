`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `node2_nr` is 6, so it will become 7. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 6, `m` is 4, `v` is an integer, `node2_nr` is 7, `edges` contains tuples including the final iteration being `(2, 5)` and also containing the appended tuple `(2, 6)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `m` is 4, `v` is an integer, `node2_nr` is 7, `edges` contains tuples including the final iteration being `(2, 5)` and also containing the appended tuple `(2, 6)`**
