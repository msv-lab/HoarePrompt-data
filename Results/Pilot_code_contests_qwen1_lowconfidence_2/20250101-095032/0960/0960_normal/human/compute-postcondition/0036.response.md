`m` is decremented by 1. Initially, `m` is 5, so after the operation, `m` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`n`, `v`, `node2_nr`, and `edges`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `m` is 4, `v` is an integer, `node2_nr` is 6, `edges` contains tuples including the final iteration being `(2, 5)` and also containing the appended tuple `(2, 6)`**
