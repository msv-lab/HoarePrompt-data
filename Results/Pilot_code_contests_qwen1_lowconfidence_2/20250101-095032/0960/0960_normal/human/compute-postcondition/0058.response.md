The code prints `-1`. Since printing does not assign a value to any variable, the only change is that the value `-1` is printed. All other variables remain in their original state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 1, `v` is an integer, `edges` is the initial list of tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1)) ]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is undefined, the value `-1` is printed**
