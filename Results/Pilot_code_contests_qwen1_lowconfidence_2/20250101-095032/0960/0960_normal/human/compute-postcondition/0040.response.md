To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop and the current state:

### Conditions in the `while` Loop:
1. `m > 0`: The loop will continue as long as `m` is greater than 0.
2. `node1_nr < n`: The loop will continue as long as `node1_nr` is less than `n`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is at least 7 (`n ≥ 7`)
- `m` is 0 (`m = 0`)
- `v` is an integer (not relevant for this specific condition)
- `node2_nr` is `n - 1` (`node2_nr = n - 1`)
- `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from `(2, 3)` up to `(2, n-1)` (not relevant for this specific condition)
- `node1_nr` is 8 (`node1_nr = 8`)

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `m > 0`**: 
   - Currently, `m` is 0. For the loop to continue, `m` must be greater than 0. Since `m` is not greater than 0, this condition cannot be met.
   
2. **Condition `node1_nr < n`**:
   - Currently, `node1_nr` is 8. Given that `n` is at least 7 (`n ≥ 7`), `node1_nr` (which is 8) is indeed less than `n`. However, since `m` is 0, the loop will not run because of the first condition.

### Conclusion:
- Since `m` is 0, the loop will not execute even if `node1_nr < n` is true.
- Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states because the loop will not proceed regardless of the values of `n` and `node1_nr`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is at least 7, `m` is 0, `node1_nr` is 8**
