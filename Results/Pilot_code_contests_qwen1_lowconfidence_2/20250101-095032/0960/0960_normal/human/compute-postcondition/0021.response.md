`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. Initially, `node2_nr` was equal to `m + 1` (since `m` is at least 1 and `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1). After the increment, `node2_nr` becomes `m + 2`. The list `edges` still contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1; `node2_nr` is `m + 2`; and the list `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
