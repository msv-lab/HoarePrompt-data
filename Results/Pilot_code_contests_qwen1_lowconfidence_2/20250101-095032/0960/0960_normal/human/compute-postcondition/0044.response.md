`m` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `m` is greater than 0, so after the operation, `m` will be one less than its original value but still greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 0 and only decreased by 1). The values of `n` and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10; `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
