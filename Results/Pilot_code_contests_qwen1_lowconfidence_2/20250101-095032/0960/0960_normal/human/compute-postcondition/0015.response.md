The code `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. However, the specific values of `edges`, `node1_nr`, and `node2_nr` are not provided in the initial state. The append operation does not change the individual values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr`, but it does modify the `edges` list by adding the tuple.

Since the exact values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` are not specified, they remain unchanged, and the `edges` list is updated by appending the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to it.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing the additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `node1_nr` is its original value, `node2_nr` is its original value**
