The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that the final iteration of `edges` is `(2, 4)`, so the last element in the list `edges` is `(2, 4)`. Since `node2_nr` is the second element in this tuple, its initial value was 4. After incrementing by 1, the value of `node2_nr` becomes 5.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` with the final iteration being `(2, 5)`**
