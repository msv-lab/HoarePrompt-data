`m` is decremented by 1. Initially, `m` is at least 2, so after decrementing, `m` is at least 1. The value of `node2_nr` remains unchanged and is its original value plus 1 and must be less than `n`. The list `edges` containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1 and must be less than `n`, and the list `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
