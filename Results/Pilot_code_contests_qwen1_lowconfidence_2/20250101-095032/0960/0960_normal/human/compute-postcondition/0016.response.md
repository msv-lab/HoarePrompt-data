`m` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `m`, but it is assumed to be an integer. The value of `edges` and its components `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is decreased by 1; `edges` is a list containing the additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`; `node1_nr` is its original value; `node2_nr` is its original value.

Output State: **`m` is decreased by 1; `edges` is a list containing the additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`; `node1_nr` is its original value; `node2_nr` is its original value.**
