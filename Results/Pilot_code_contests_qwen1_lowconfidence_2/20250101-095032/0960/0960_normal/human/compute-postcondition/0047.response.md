The code appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `node2_nr` remain unchanged. The value of `node1_nr` remains unchanged, but now the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` is added to the list `edges`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `node2_nr` is less than `n`, `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
