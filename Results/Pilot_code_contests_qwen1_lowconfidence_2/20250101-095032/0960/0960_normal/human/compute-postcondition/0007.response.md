`node1_nr` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `node1_nr` is now explicitly set, while the values of `n`, `m`, `v`, and `edges` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer less than `n - 1 - (n - 2)`, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list of tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1))], `node1_nr` is 1**
