`node1_nr` is incremented by 1. Initially, `node1_nr` is set to 1 in the loop, so after this operation, `node1_nr` will be 2. The values of the other variables (`m`, `v`, `edges`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` for each iteration of the loop, with `node1_nr` being 2 and `node2_nr` being `m + 2` for the final iteration, and `node2_nr` is `n - 1` after the loop.**
