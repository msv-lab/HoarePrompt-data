The `exit()` function call will terminate the program, and no further code will be executed. As a result, the values of the variables before calling `exit()` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 1, `v` is an integer, `edges` is the initial list of tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1)) ]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is undefined, the value `-1` is printed**
