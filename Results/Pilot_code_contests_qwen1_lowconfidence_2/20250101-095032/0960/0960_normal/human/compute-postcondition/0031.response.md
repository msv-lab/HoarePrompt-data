The code `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given that the last iteration of the tuple was `(2, 5)`, this tuple is appended to the list `edges`. 

The initial conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `n` is at least 4.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `v` is an integer.
- `edges` now contains the tuple `(2, 5)` and the newly appended tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` with the final iteration being `(2, 5)` and also containing the appended tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
