`m` is decremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state. The initial state was `m` must be greater than 0. After decrementing, `m` will still be greater than 0 unless it was initially 1, in which case it would become 0. However, since `m` must be greater than 0 initially, the output state remains that `m` is greater than 0. The values of `n`, `v`, and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` with the final iteration being `(2, 4)`**
