Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `v` are integers. If `m` is less than `n - 1`, the postcondition remains as the preconditions where `m` is less than `n - 1`. There is no change to the values of `n` and `v` in this case. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change from the precondition unless the if condition is satisfied.***
