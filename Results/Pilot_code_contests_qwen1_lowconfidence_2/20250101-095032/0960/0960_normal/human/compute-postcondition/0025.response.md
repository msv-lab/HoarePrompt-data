The code assigns the value of `node1_nr + 2` to `node2_nr`. Given the initial state, `node1_nr` is 2 and `node2_nr` is `n - 1` after the loop. Since the loop sets `node2_nr` to `n - 1` in its final iteration, the new value of `node2_nr` will be `2 + 2 = 4`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` for each iteration of the loop, with `node1_nr` being 2 and `node2_nr` being 4 for the final iteration, and `node2_nr` is 4 after the loop.**
