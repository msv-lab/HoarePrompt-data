To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the `while` loop will continue iterating:

The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } m > 0 \text{ and } node2_nr < n \]

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` has been decreased by 1.
- `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.
- `node1_nr` is its original value.
- `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the `while` loop must be true:
1. \( m > 0 \)
2. \( node2_nr < n \)

Since `m` has been decreased by 1, for \( m > 0 \) to hold true in the next iteration, `m` must have been greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` was at least 2 before the current iteration started.

For the second condition, since `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1, it will increase by 1 in each iteration of the loop. For the loop to continue, `node2_nr` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- `m` must have been at least 2 before the current iteration (so that it remains greater than 0 in the next iteration).
- `node2_nr` must be less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration (so that it can still be incremented and remain less than `n` in the next iteration).

State: **`m` must be at least 2, `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1 and must be less than `n`**
