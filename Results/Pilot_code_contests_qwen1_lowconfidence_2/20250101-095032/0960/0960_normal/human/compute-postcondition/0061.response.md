The code snippet `translate = [(i + 1) for i in xrange(n)]` creates a list comprehension that generates a list of integers starting from 1 up to n. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. The variable `translate` is assigned a new list generated by the list comprehension. Each element in this list is `(i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. The original values of `n`, `m`, `v`, `edges`, `node1_nr`, and `node2_nr` remain unchanged.
3. The value of `m` is checked, and if `m > 0`, the value `-1` is printed. However, since we are only asked to provide the output state after running the code and not to execute the print statement, the value of `m` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is the initial list of tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1)) ]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is undefined, `translate` is a list of integers `[1, 2, ..., n]`.**
