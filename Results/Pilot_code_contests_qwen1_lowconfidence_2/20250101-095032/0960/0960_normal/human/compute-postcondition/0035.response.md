The code appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state, `node1_nr` is not specified directly but can be inferred from the last tuple in `edges`, which is `(2, 5)`. This suggests that `node1_nr` is 2. The value of `node2_nr` is 6.

Therefore, the tuple `(2, 6)` is appended to `edges`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `m` is 5, `v` is an integer, `node2_nr` is 6, `edges` contains tuples including the final iteration being `(2, 5)` and also containing the appended tuple `(2, 6)`**
