To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one more time, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
```

Right before the loop, the states are:
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer greater than 0
- `v` is an integer
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing edges in a graph
- `node1_nr` is 1
- `node2_nr` is 3

For the loop to execute at least one more time, both conditions in the `while` loop must be true:
1. `m > 0`
2. `node2_nr < n`

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition `m > 0`:**
   - Currently, `m` is an integer greater than 0. This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for this part.

2. **Condition `node2_nr < n`:**
   - Currently, `node2_nr` is 3.
   - For the condition `node2_nr < n` to be true, `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list of tuples representing edges in a graph, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
