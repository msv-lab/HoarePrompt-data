Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is 1, `v` is an integer, `edges` is the initial list of tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1)) ]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is undefined***

Explanation: Given the if condition `if (m > 0):`, we update `m` to 1 since `m` was initially 0 and now the condition `m > 0` is true. All other variables remain as per the precondition.
