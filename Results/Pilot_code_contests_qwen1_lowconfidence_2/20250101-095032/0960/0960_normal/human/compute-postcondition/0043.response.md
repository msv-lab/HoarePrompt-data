The code snippet `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. However, the values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` are not provided in the initial state, nor are they modified within the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the addition of this tuple to the list `edges`.

Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 10 and `m` is greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are still valid as per their initial conditions, and the new tuple is added to the `edges` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10; `m` is greater than 0; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
