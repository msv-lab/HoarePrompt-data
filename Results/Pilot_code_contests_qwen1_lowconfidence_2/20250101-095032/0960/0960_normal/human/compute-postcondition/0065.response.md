The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. `n` is an integer representing the number of servers, `m` is an integer representing the number of direct connections, and `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server. The conditions are 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ `v` ≤ `n`. 

Case_1: The function returns information related to the number of servers (`n`), the number of direct connections (`m`), and the index of the failing server (`v`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `n`, `m`, and `v` and return information based on these inputs, specifically regarding the number of servers, the number of direct connections, and the index of the failing server.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `v`, where `n` represents the number of servers, `m` represents the number of direct connections, and `v` represents the index of the failing server. It returns information based on these inputs.**
