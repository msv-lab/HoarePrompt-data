The code `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `node2_nr`. It only modifies the list `edges` by adding the specified tuple.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10; `m` must be greater than 0; `node2_nr` must be less than `n`; `edges` is a list containing one more tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
