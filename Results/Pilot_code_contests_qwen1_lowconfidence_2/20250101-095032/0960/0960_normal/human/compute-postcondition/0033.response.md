`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` is derived from the last tuple in `edges`, which is `(2, 5)`, meaning `m` is 5 before the increment. After the increment, `node2_nr` is 6, and `m` remains 5 since it is not directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4; `m` is 5; `v` is an integer; `node2_nr` is 6; `edges` contains tuples including the final iteration being `(2, 5)` and also containing the appended tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
