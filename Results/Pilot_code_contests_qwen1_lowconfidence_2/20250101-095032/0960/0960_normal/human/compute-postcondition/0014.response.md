To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop and the current values of the variables.

The loop condition is:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
```

Given the current state:
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `m` is an integer greater than 0 and now `m` is one less than its original value
- `v` is an integer (no change needed for this variable)
- `edges` is a list containing the tuple (1, 3) (no change needed for this variable)
- `node1_nr` is 1 (no change needed for this variable)
- `node2_nr` is 4 (no change needed for this variable)

### Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `m > 0`**
   - Currently, `m` is one less than its original value. For the loop to continue, `m` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `m` must be at least 1 before the loop starts.

2. **Condition 2: `node2_nr < n`**
   - Currently, `node2_nr` is 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 3 and `node2_nr` is currently 4, `node2_nr < n` will always be true as long as `n` is greater than 4.

### Conclusion:

- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `m` must be at least 1.
- The current value of `n` must be maintained as greater than 3.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect these requirements.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be at least 1**
