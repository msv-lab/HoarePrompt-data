`node1_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `node1_nr` is at least 7, so it becomes 8. The states of the other variables (`m`, `v`, `node2_nr`, and `edges`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 7, `m` is 0, `v` is an integer, `node2_nr` is `n-1`, `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from `(2, 3)` up to `(2, n-1)`, `node1_nr` is 8.

Output State: **`n` is at least 7, `m` is 0, `v` is an integer, `node2_nr` is `n-1`, `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from `(2, 3)` up to `(2, n-1)`, `node1_nr` is 8**
