`m` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `m - 1`. The values of `n`, `v`, and `edges` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4; `m` is `m - 1`; `v` is an integer; `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` with the final iteration being `(2, 5)` and also containing the appended tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.
