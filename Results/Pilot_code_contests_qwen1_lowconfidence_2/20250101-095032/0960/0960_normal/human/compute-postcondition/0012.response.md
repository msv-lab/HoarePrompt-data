`m` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `m` is its previous value minus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer greater than 0 and now `m` is one less than its original value, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing the tuple (1, 3), `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
