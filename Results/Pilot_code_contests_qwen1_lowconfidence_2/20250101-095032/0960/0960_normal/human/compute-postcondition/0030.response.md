Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is at least 4 (`n >= 4`).
   - `m` is greater than 0 (`m > 0`).
   - `v` is an integer (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, with the final iteration being `(2, 5)`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0 (`m > 0`).
   - `node2_nr` must be less than `n` (`node2_nr < n`).

4. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop must still hold true:
     - `m` must still be greater than 0 (`m > 0`).
     - `node2_nr` must still be less than `n` (`node2_nr < n`).

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since we need the loop to continue, `m` must remain greater than 0.
   - Similarly, `node2_nr` must remain less than `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - No new constraints need to be added beyond ensuring `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n` since these are the conditions that must hold for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration remains the same as the current state.

**State**: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` with the final iteration being `(2, 5)`**
