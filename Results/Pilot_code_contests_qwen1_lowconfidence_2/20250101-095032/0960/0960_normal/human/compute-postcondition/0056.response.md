Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is an integer less than `n - 1 - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `m < 1`.
- `v` is an integer.
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1)) ]`.
- `node1_nr` is 1.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer While Loop Condition**:
   - The outer loop runs as long as `m > 0` and `node1_nr < n`.

2. **Inner While Loop Condition**:
   - The inner loop runs as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Loop Iterations**:
   - In each iteration of the outer loop, `node1_nr` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time the outer loop runs.
   - For each `node1_nr`, `node2_nr` starts at `node1_nr + 2` and increments by 1 until `node2_nr` reaches `n` or `m` becomes 0.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - Since `m` is always less than 1, `m` will never be greater than 0, meaning the inner loop will never run even once.

### Conclusion:
Given that `m` is less than 1, the condition `m > 0` is never satisfied, so the loops do not execute at all. Therefore, no edges are added to the `edges` list, and the values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` do not change from their initial values.

### Output State:
- `n` remains as it was.
- `m` remains as it was, which is 0.
- `v` remains as it was.
- `edges` remains as the initial list of tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1)) ]`.
- `node1_nr` remains 1.
- `node2_nr` remains undefined because it never gets a chance to be assigned.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is the initial list of tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1)) ]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is undefined**
