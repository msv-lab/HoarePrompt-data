`node2_nr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer greater than 0 and now `m` is one less than its original value, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing the tuple (1, 3), `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 4.
