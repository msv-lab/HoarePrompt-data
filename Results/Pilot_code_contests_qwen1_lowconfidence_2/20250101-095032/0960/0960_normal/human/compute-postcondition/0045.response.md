`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 10, the value of `m` remains greater than 0 but is now decreased by 1, and the list `edges` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 10; `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`; `node2_nr` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10; `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`; `node2_nr` is increased by 1**
