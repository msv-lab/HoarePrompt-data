`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` and `edges` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is decreased by 1; `edges` is a list containing the additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `node1_nr` is its original value; `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1.

Output State: **`m` is decreased by 1; `edges` is a list containing the additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `node1_nr` is its original value; `node2_nr` is its original value plus 1.**
