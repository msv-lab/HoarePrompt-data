The code `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` adds a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state where `node1_nr` is 1 and `node2_nr` is 3, the tuple `(1, 3)` is appended to the list `edges`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing the tuple (1, 3), `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
