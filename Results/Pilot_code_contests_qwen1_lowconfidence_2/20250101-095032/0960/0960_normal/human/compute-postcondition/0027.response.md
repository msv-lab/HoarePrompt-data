The code appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Before the code execution, `node1_nr` is 2 and `node2_nr` is 4. After appending, the list `edges` will contain this new tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` with the final iteration being `(2, 4)`.**
