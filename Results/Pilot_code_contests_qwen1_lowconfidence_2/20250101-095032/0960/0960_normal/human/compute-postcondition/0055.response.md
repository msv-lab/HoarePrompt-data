The value of `node1_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `node1_nr` was derived from the initial value of `n`, which is greater than 10. Since `node2_nr` is `n - 1`, and `edges` is a list containing `n - 10` tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, the conditions of the edges and `node2_nr` remain unchanged. The state of `n` and `m` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10, `m` is 0, `node2_nr` is `n - 1`, `edges` is a list containing `n - 10` tuples `(node1_nr + 1, node2_nr)`, `node1_nr` is `n - 1 + 1**
