`m` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `m` is `m - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10; `m` is greater than 0 and now equals `m - 1`; `node2_nr` must be less than `n`; `edges` is a list containing one more tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
