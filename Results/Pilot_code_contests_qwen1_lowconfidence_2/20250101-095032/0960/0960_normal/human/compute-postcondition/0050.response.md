Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as both conditions `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n` are true.

2. **Current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than 10.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `node2_nr` is a value between 1 and 11 (exclusive).
   - `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m > 0` must remain true.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node2_nr < n` must remain true.

4. **Check each condition**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue. Since `m` was greater than or equal to 0 in the previous iteration, we only need to ensure it is still greater than 0.
   - `node2_nr` must be less than `n`. In the previous iteration, `node2_nr` was less than `n` because `n` is greater than 10 and `node2_nr` is between 1 and 11. To ensure this condition holds for the next iteration, `node2_nr` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` is greater than 10, `m` must be greater than 0, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`**
