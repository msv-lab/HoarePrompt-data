The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately without executing any further code. Since the program terminates, no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and `v` is an integer; m is less than n - 1**
