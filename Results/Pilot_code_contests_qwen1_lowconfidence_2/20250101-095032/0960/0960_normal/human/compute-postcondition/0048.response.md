`m` is decremented by 1, which means its new value is `m - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 (since it was greater than or equal to 1 and now decremented by 1), `node2_nr` is less than `n`, `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
