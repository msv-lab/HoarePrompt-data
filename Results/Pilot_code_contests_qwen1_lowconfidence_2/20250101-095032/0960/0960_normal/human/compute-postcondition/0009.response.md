`node2_nr` is assigned the value of `node1_nr + 2`. Given that `node1_nr` is initially 1, the value of `node2_nr` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `v`, `edges`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `v` is an integer, `edges` is a list of tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., ((n-2), (n-1))], `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
