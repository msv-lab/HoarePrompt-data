The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `v`. These values replace the existing values of `n`, `m`, and `v` from the initial state. Since the input is not specified in the example, the new values of `n`, `m`, and `v` will be the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (input value), `m` is an integer (input value), `v` is an integer (input value)**
