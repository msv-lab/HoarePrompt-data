Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the requirement that when the server with index `v` fails, the transmission of data between some other two servers becomes impossible. The code attempts to construct a network of servers with the specified number of direct connections but does not ensure that removing server `v` disconnects the network.

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Initial Check**: The code checks if `m` is less than `n - 1`. If it is, the function prints `-1` and exits, which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Building Initial Connections**: The code creates an initial set of `n - 1` direct connections, forming a linear chain of servers. This part is correct.

3. **Adding Additional Connections**: The code then tries to add more connections using a nested loop. However, the logic here is flawed. The variable `m` is decremented without properly ensuring that the connections form a network where removing server `v` would disconnect the network.

4. **Reordering Server Indices**: The code reorders the server indices to reflect the failure of server `v`. This part is correct but does not address the fundamental issue of ensuring the network remains connected until server `v` is removed.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following scenario:

- **Input**: `n = 5`, `m = 6`, `v = 3`
- **Expected Output**: A network where removing server `3` disconnects the network. For example:
  ```
  1 2
  2 3
  3 4
  4 5
  1 3
  3 5
  ```

In the provided code, even though the output might look correct for some inputs, it does not guarantee that the network will remain connected until server `v` is removed. The code simply tries to use all available connections to form a network, but it does not enforce the specific requirement about the disconnection upon removal of server `v`.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
