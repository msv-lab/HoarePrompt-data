You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bob got a job as a system administrator in X corporation. His first task was to connect n servers with the help of m two-way direct connection so that it becomes possible to transmit data from one server to any other server via these connections. Each direct connection has to link two different servers, each pair of servers should have at most one direct connection. Y corporation, a business rival of X corporation, made Bob an offer that he couldn't refuse: Bob was asked to connect the servers in such a way, that when server with index v fails, the transmission of data between some other two servers becomes impossible, i.e. the system stops being connected. Help Bob connect the servers.

Input

The first input line contains 3 space-separated integer numbers n, m, v (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ v ≤ n), n — amount of servers, m — amount of direct connections, v — index of the server that fails and leads to the failure of the whole system.

Output

If it is impossible to connect the servers in the required way, output -1. Otherwise output m lines with 2 numbers each — description of all the direct connections in the system. Each direct connection is described by two numbers — indexes of two servers, linked by this direct connection. The servers are numbered from 1. If the answer is not unique, output any.

def func():
    (n, m, v) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if m < n - 1:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    edges = [(i, i + 1) for i in xrange(n - 1)]
    m = m - len(edges)
    node1_nr = 1
    while m > 0 and node1_nr < n:
        node2_nr = node1_nr + 2
        while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
            edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))
            m -= 1
            node2_nr += 1
        node1_nr += 1
    if m > 0:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    translate = [i + 1 for i in xrange(n)]
    (translate[v - 1], translate[1]) = (translate[1], translate[v - 1])
    output = ['%d %d' % (translate[n1], translate[n2]) for (n1, n2) in edges]
    print('\n'.join(output))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to create a graph where the removal of a specific server (v) disconnects the network. However, the implementation has a flaw. Specifically, the current approach does not guarantee that removing server v will disconnect the network. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if `m` is less than `n - 1`. If it is, it prints `-1` because it cannot form a connected graph with fewer connections than nodes minus one.
2. It then constructs a linear chain of connections between servers, ensuring each server is connected sequentially.
3. Finally, it attempts to add additional connections to ensure `m` connections are met, but the method to add these connections does not necessarily ensure that removing server v will disconnect the network.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5 6 3
```

**Expected Output:**
A configuration where removing server 3 makes the network disconnected. One valid configuration could be:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```

However, the provided solution does not guarantee this. For instance, the way the additional connections are added might not ensure that the network remains connected until server 3 is removed. 

For example, if we run the provided code with the above input, it might produce a configuration like:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```

This configuration ensures that the network is connected, but it does not guarantee that removing server 3 will disconnect the network. There could be other configurations that also meet the constraints but do not fulfill the requirement that removing server 3 should disconnect the network.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` takes three parameters: `n` (number of servers), `m` (number of direct connections), and `v` (index of the failing server). It constructs a network of servers connected by direct links under certain conditions and then reconfigures the network after the failure of one server. Specifically, the function first checks if the number of direct connections is sufficient for a fully connected network minus one server (i.e., \(m \geq n-1\)). If not, it prints `-1` and exits. Otherwise, it builds an initial set of direct connections between servers and further adds additional connections to ensure the remaining direct connections are used up. If any direct connections are still left over after the initial setup, it prints `-1` and exits. Finally, it reorders the server indices to reflect the failure of server `v` and prints out the new configuration of direct connections between the servers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
