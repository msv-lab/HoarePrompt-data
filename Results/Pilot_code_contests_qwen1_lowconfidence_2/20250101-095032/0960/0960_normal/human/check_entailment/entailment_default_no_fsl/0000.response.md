Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the server with index `v` is the first or last server in the sequence. In such cases, removing the server `v` does not necessarily disconnect the network because the network can still remain connected through other paths. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 6 5
```
The expected output should be a configuration where removing server 5 disconnects the network. However, the current implementation may not produce such a configuration. 

Hereâ€™s a specific case to illustrate the issue:
- For `n=5`, `m=6`, and `v=5`, the code will construct a linear chain of connections (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5) and additional connections. After reordering the indices to reflect the failure of server 5, the network might still remain connected. 

To fix this, you need to ensure that the network is specifically designed such that removing server `v` breaks the connectivity. This could involve more complex logic to ensure that critical connections are formed around the server `v`.
