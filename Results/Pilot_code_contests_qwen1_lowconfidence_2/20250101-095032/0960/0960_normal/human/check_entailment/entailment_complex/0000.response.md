Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Preconditions Check**: 
   - The program checks if `m` (the number of direct connections) is at least `n-1` (since we need `n-1` connections to form a connected graph with `n` nodes). If `m < n-1`, the program outputs `-1` and exits, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program constructs a connected graph using the first `n-1` edges, connecting server `i` to server `i+1` for `i` in the range `[0, n-2]`. This ensures that the graph is initially connected.
   - Then, it iteratively adds more edges to use up the remaining `m - (n-1)` connections, ensuring that each addition maintains connectivity. This process is correctly implemented through nested loops.

3. **Handling Excess Edges**:
   - After constructing the initial set of `n-1` edges, the program checks if any edges remain unadded (`m > 0`). If there are, it outputs `-1` and exits, indicating that the desired configuration cannot be achieved.

4. **Reconfiguration After Failure**:
   - The program reorders the server indices to reflect the failure of server `v` by swapping the index of server `v` with the index of the second server (server `1`).
   - It then prints the new configuration of the direct connections, reflecting the failure of server `v`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem description. It checks the necessary conditions, constructs the required graph, and reconfigures the graph after the failure of a specific server. Therefore, the program is correct.
