Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to create a graph where the removal of a specific server (v) disconnects the network. However, the implementation has a flaw. Specifically, the current approach does not guarantee that removing server v will disconnect the network. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if `m` is less than `n - 1`. If it is, it prints `-1` because it cannot form a connected graph with fewer connections than nodes minus one.
2. It then constructs a linear chain of connections between servers, ensuring each server is connected sequentially.
3. Finally, it attempts to add additional connections to ensure `m` connections are met, but the method to add these connections does not necessarily ensure that removing server v will disconnect the network.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5 6 3
```

**Expected Output:**
A configuration where removing server 3 makes the network disconnected. One valid configuration could be:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```

However, the provided solution does not guarantee this. For instance, the way the additional connections are added might not ensure that the network remains connected until server 3 is removed. 

For example, if we run the provided code with the above input, it might produce a configuration like:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```

This configuration ensures that the network is connected, but it does not guarantee that removing server 3 will disconnect the network. There could be other configurations that also meet the constraints but do not fulfill the requirement that removing server 3 should disconnect the network.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case, making it incorrect.
