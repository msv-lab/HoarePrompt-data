Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the inputs `n`, `m`, and `v` correctly using `raw_input().split()` and converts them to integers.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - The program checks if `m < n - 1`. If true, it prints `-1` and exits because it is impossible to create a connected graph with fewer edges than necessary to connect all servers minus one (since one server fails).

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program initializes the edges to form a path connecting all servers except for the failing server `v`.
   - It then iteratively adds additional edges to ensure the graph remains connected even after server `v` fails. These additional edges are added between pairs of nodes such that the graph remains connected.

4. **Validation and Output**:
   - After constructing the edges, the program checks if `m` is still greater than 0. If true, it prints `-1` and exits, indicating that the number of edges provided is insufficient.
   - If the construction is successful, the program re-indexes the nodes to adjust for the fact that one node (server `v`) might fail and then outputs the edges in the required format.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to ensure that the system fails if any specific server (`v`) fails. The construction of the graph ensures that the remaining servers remain connected even after the failure of server `v`.

Thus, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential valid input.
