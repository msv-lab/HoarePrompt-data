Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the server `v` is the only central server in the network, and removing it disconnects the network. This happens when the connections form a star-like structure centered around server `v`. For example, consider the input:

```
6 10 3
```

In this case, connecting all servers to server `3` will make the network dependent on server `3`. Removing server `3` will disconnect all other servers from each other. However, the program does not ensure this dependency. It simply forms a linear or tree-like structure, which may not meet the requirement. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
