Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the recurrence relation used in the `dp` array calculation is incorrect. The problem description states that Vasya should use the second portal if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses and the first portal if it contains an even number of crosses. However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate this behavior.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation in the code does not correctly simulate the behavior of Vasya painting crosses and moving through the portals. The current implementation sums `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` from `p[i]` to `i-1`, which does not accurately represent the process of Vasya moving through the maze.

2. **Redundant Addition**: The `total_pjumps` computation includes redundant additions of `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` within the loop, which should be removed. This addition is not necessary and does not contribute to the correct calculation of the total number of portal jumps.

To fix these issues, the `dp` array should be initialized differently and the recurrence relation should be adjusted to correctly simulate the process of Vasya painting crosses and moving through the portals. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    mod = 1000000007

    # Calculate the number of portal jumps required to start off at each room i
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i] = 1  # Starting point
        else:
            dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for j in range(p[i], i)) % mod

    total_pjumps = sum(dp[i] for i in range(n)) % mod
    print(total_pjumps)
```

This corrected version initializes the `dp` array correctly and uses the proper recurrence relation to calculate the number of portal jumps required to get to room `(n + 1)`.
