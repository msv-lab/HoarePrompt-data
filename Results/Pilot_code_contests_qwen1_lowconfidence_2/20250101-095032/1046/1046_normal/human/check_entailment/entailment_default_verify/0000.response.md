Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of portal moves Vasya needs to make to exit the maze. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly follow the rules outlined in the problem description. According to the problem, Vasya should use the second portal if the number of crosses on the ceiling is odd, and the first portal otherwise. However, the current implementation in `func_2` calculates the number of portal jumps in a manner that does not reflect this behavior. The output hints also point out that the final values in the `dp` array are incorrectly described and that there are redundant additions in the `total_pjumps` computation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and should be considered incorrect.
