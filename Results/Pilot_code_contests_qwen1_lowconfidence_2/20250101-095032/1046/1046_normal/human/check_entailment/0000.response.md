Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of portal moves required does not match the intended behavior.

The problem requires Vasya to use the second portal if the number of crosses on the ceiling is odd, and the first portal otherwise. However, the program calculates the number of portal jumps using a different approach, which does not accurately reflect this behavior.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
1 1 2
```
According to the problem description, the sequence of moves would be:
1. Start at room 1 (odd crosses, use second portal to room 1).
2. Room 1 again (even crosses, use first portal to room 2).
3. Room 2 (odd crosses, use second portal to room 1).
4. Room 1 again (even crosses, use first portal to room 2).
5. Room 2 again (odd crosses, use second portal to room 3).
6. Room 3 (even crosses, stop).

This should result in 6 portal moves. However, the program would incorrectly calculate the number of moves due to its misinterpretation of the problem logic.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the specified behavior and thus is incorrect.
