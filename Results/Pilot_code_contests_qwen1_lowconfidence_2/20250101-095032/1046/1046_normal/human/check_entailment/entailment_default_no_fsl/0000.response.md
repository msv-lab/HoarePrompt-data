Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_2` contains several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Recurrence Relation Calculation**: The recurrence relation used in the code is incorrect. According to the problem description, if Vasya is in room `i` and has an odd number of crosses, he should use the second portal to go to room `pi`. This means the number of portal jumps required to transition from an odd number of crosses to an even number of crosses should be calculated differently. The current implementation incorrectly sums up the `dp` values from `p[i]` to `i-1` without properly accounting for the transitions.

2. **Redundant Modulo Operations**: The code performs unnecessary modulo operations within the inner loop, which can lead to incorrect results. The modulo operation `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is redundant and should be removed.

3. **Final Total Calculation**: The final total calculation should only sum the `dp` values without adding an extra `1` at the end of each iteration.

To fix these issues, the recurrence relation should be correctly implemented to account for the transitions between rooms based on the parity of the number of crosses. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i] = 1  # Starting point
        else:
            portal_jumps = 1
            for j in range(p[i], i):
                portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000007)
            dp[i] = portal_jumps % (1000000007)
    
    total_pjumps = sum(dp) % (1000000007)
    print(total_pjumps)
```

With these corrections, the code should now correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
