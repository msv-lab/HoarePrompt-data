Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, there are a few issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Recurrence Relation:**
   - The problem description states that Vasya uses the second portal if the number of crosses on the ceiling is odd and the first portal otherwise. However, the program's `func_2` does not accurately reflect this logic.
   - The recurrence relation used in the program (`dp[i] = 1 + [Sum_{j = p(i)}^{i-1} dp[j] + 1]`) is not directly related to the problem description. It seems to be calculating something different and does not account for the parity (odd/even) of the number of crosses.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Portal Jumps:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the number of portal jumps required to transition from an odd number of crosses to an even number of crosses and vice versa.
   - The calculation of `portal_jumps` inside the nested loops is not aligned with the problem statement. The program does not properly simulate Vasya's movement through the maze based on the parity of the number of crosses.

3. **Final Calculation of Total Portal Jumps:**
   - The final calculation of `total_pjumps` at the end of `func_2` does not reflect the intended behavior. It seems to overcomplicate the problem and does not correctly count the number of portal jumps needed to reach the (n+1)-th room.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the DP Table:**
   - Create a DP table where `dp[i]` represents the number of portal jumps required to transition from an odd number of crosses to an even number of crosses starting from room `i`.

2. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - For each room `i`, calculate the number of portal jumps required to reach room `i` from the previous room with an odd number of crosses and add the necessary jumps to reach the next room with an even number of crosses.

3. **Calculate the Final Result:**
   - Sum up the values in the DP table to get the total number of portal jumps required to reach the (n+1)-th room.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(line):
    n = int(next(line).strip())
    P = [(int(p_i) - 1) for p_i in next(line).split()]
    return n, P

def func_2(n, p):
    MOD = 1000000007
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i == 1:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            dp[i] = (dp[p[i - 1]] + 1) % MOD
    
    result = sum(dp[1:]) % MOD
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (n, P) = func_1(sys.stdin)
    func_2(n, P)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[i]` is initialized to 0 for all `i`.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1 because Vasya starts in room 1 with an odd number of crosses (1 cross).

2. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - For each room `i` (from 2 to n+1), `dp[i]` is calculated based on the value of `dp[p[i-1]]`. This ensures that the parity of crosses is considered.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The sum of `dp[1:]` gives the total number of portal jumps required to reach the (n+1)-th room.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description and ensures that Vasya's movements through the maze are accurately simulated.
