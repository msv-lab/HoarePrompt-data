Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided implementation does not match the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms this. Specifically, the program calculates the number of portal jumps using a different logic than required by the problem statement. According to the problem, Vasya should use the second portal if the number of crosses is odd and the first portal otherwise. However, the implementation in `func_2` does not accurately reflect this behavior. Instead, it appears to be calculating the number of portal jumps in a way that does not correspond to the intended sequence of moves as described. For example, the annotated version shows that the `dp` array is initialized in a way that does not reflect the correct state transitions based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program remains incorrect.
