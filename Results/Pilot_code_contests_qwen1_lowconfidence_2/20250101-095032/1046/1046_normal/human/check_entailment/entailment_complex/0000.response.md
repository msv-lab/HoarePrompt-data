Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not properly calculate the number of portal jumps required to get from the first room to the last room according to the given rules. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `dp` Array:**
   - The annotations suggest that the `dp` array should store the number of portal jumps required to start off at room `i` with an odd number of crosses and get back to room `i` with an even number of crosses.
   - However, the code initializes `dp[i]` to 0 and then attempts to fill it using the given recurrence relation, but the implementation is flawed.
   - The inner loop iterates over a range from `p[i]` to `i-1` and accumulates the values in `dp[j]`, but this does not accurately represent the logic of the problem description.

2. **Redundant and Incorrect Additions:**
   - The code adds `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` multiple times in the calculation of `total_pjumps`, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Final Output Calculation:**
   - The final output calculation `print(total_pjumps)` does not correctly reflect the number of portal jumps needed to get from room 1 to room `n+1`.

To correctly solve the problem, the `dp` array should be filled according to the given rules and the final result should be calculated properly. Here is a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[p[i-1]] + 1
            if (dp[i] + dp[i-1]) % 2 == 1:
                dp[i] += 1
    
    total_pjumps = sum(dp) % (1000000007)
    print(total_pjumps)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `dp` array is filled correctly according to the problem description and the final result is computed accurately. Therefore, the original code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
