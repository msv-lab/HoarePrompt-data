Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the recurrence relation and the way the `dp` array is being updated do not accurately reflect the described behavior of Vasya painting crosses and choosing portals based on the parity of crosses.

The key issue lies in how the `dp` array is calculated. The current implementation seems to misinterpret the problem's requirements. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: When Vasya enters a room, he paints a cross. If the room has an odd number of crosses (including the new one), he uses the second portal (going to room \(p_i\)). Otherwise, he uses the first portal (going to room \(i+1\)).

2. **Correct Recurrence Relation**: We need to track the number of moves required to transition from an odd number of crosses to an even number of crosses and vice versa. For each room \(i\), we need to sum up the moves required to transition through each possible previous room \(j\) where \(j \leq p_i\).

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_2(n, p):
    MOD = 1000000007
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = 2  # Initial value for odd transitions
        for j in range(p[i], i):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD
        if i < n - 1:
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD  # Adding one for the final transition to the next room
    
    total_pjumps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total_pjumps = (total_pjumps + dp[i]) % MOD
    return total_pjumps

# Reading input
n = int(input().strip())
p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Calculating and printing the result
result = func_2(n, p)
print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `dp` array correctly tracks the number of moves required for each room, considering the parity of crosses and the transitions as per the problem description.
