The function `func_1` accepts an iterator `line` yielding strings, where the first string provides the number of rooms `n`, and the second string provides `n` space-separated integers representing the sequence `P`. It reads these values, converts them appropriately, and yields a tuple containing `n` and `P`. After executing the function, the state of the program is such that `line` becomes an empty iterator, `n` holds the number of rooms read from the first string, and `P` is a list of `n-1` elements, where each element is an integer derived from the second string by converting it to an integer and subtracting 1. The function handles the case where `line` is exhausted and yields the parsed data. No edge cases are explicitly mentioned in the annotations or the code, but it is assumed that `line` provides exactly two strings as expected, and these strings contain valid integers. If `line` does not provide the expected format, the function will raise a `StopIteration` exception.
