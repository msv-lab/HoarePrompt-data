The code increments `portal_jumps` by 1, and then takes the result modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given that `portal_jumps` initially is 3, the new value of `portal_jumps` is calculated as follows:

\[ portal\_jumps = (3 + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7) = 4 \% 1000000007 = 4 \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `portal_jumps` is 4; `j` starts from `p[i] + 2`; `portal_jumps` is 4**
