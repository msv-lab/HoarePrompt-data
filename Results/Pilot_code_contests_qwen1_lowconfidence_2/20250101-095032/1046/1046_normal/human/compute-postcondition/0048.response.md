The code snippet `total_pjumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments `total_pjumps` by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given that `total_pjumps` was initially \(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1\), the new value of `total_pjumps` is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{new\_total\_pjumps} = 2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1 + 1 \% (1000000000.0 + 7) \]

Since \(1 \% (1000000000.0 + 7)\) is 1, the equation simplifies to:

\[ \text{new\_total\_pjumps} = 2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2 \]

Therefore, the updated value of `total_pjumps` is \(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\).

The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `p`, `dp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is \(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\)**
