The code updates `dp[i]` to the value of `int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))`. Given that `portal_jumps` is `2 * n + 1`, we can calculate `dp[i]` as follows:

1. `dp[i]` is updated to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.
2. Since `2 * n + 1` is a constant for this calculation, let's denote it as `C` where `C = 2 * n + 1`.
3. Thus, `dp[i]` becomes `int(C % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, `portal_jumps` is `2 * n + 1`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**
