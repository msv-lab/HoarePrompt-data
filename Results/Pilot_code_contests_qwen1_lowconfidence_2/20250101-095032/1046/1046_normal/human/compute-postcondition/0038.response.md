The code `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` updates the value of `portal_jumps` by adding 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given that `portal_jumps` is initially calculated as \(3 + 3 \times \text{int}((2 \times n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), let's denote this initial value as \(k\). Thus, `portal_jumps` is initially \(k\).

After the operation, the new value of `portal_jumps` becomes \(k + 1 \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)\).

All other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, `i`, `p[i]`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2 \times n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\); `portal_jumps` is \(k + 1 \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)\); `i` is `n - 1`; `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`; `j` is `p[i] + 2`.**
