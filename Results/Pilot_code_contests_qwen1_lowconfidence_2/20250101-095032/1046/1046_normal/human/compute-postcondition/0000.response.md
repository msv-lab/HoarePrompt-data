The given code snippet is a docstring explaining the logic behind calculating the number of portal jumps required for Vasya to get from room `i` with an odd number of crosses to an even number of crosses and back to room `i` with an even number of crosses. However, the actual code implementation is not provided. Based on the given initial state and the explanation, no direct changes to the variables `n` or `p` are made in the provided snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, and p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p[i] <= i for each 0 <= i < n.**
