The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`.
- `portal_jumps` is `n + 3 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1`, where `j = p[i] - 1`.
- `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`.
- `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.
- `j` is `p[i] - 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```
portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the variables:

1. `dp[j]` is taken from the `dp` list. Since `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `dp[j]` will be `n + 1`.
2. `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` will be `(n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Since `n + 1` is less than `1000000000.0 + 7`, this will simply be `n + 1`.
3. `portal_jumps` is updated by adding `n + 1` to its current value.

Therefore, the new value of `portal_jumps` is the old value of `portal_jumps` plus `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`; `portal_jumps` is the original `portal_jumps` value plus `n + 1`; `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`; `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`; `j` is `p[i] - 1`.**
