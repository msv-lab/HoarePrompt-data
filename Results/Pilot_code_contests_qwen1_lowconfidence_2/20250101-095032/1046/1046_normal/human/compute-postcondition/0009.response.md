`portal_jumps` is incremented by 1, and then the result is taken modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given that `portal_jumps` was initially 2, the new value of `portal_jumps` will be calculated as follows:

\[ portal\_jumps = (2 + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7) = 3 \% 1000000007 = 3 \]

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `portal_jumps` is 3; `j` starts from `p[i] + 1`; `portal_jumps` is 3.
