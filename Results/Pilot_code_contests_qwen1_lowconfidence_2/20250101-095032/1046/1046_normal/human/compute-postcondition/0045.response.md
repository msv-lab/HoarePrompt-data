The code snippet increments `total_pjumps` by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Initially, `total_pjumps` is set to `dp[0] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Since `dp` is a list of integers each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `dp[0]` is equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\).

Therefore, `total_pjumps` starts as \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\). After the code runs, `total_pjumps` is incremented by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is (\(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)**
