Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is \(n \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + n\)**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(n-1\). After the loop finishes, the variable `i` will be equal to \(n\).
- The loop increments `total_pjumps` by `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` and by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` in each iteration.
- Since `dp[i]` is always \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), the value of `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is always \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\).
- Therefore, in each iteration, `total_pjumps` increases by \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1\).
- Over \(n\) iterations, `total_pjumps` will increase by \(n \times (\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1)\).
- Simplifying, `total_pjumps` will be \(n \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + n\).

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., when \(n = 0\)):
- `i` will still be 0.
- `total_pjumps` will remain 0.
- The values of `n`, `p`, and `dp` will not change.
