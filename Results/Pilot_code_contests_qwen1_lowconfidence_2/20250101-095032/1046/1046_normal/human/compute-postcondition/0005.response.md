The code increments `portal_jumps` by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Given that `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `dp[j]` will always be 0 for any index `j` because `dp` is initialized with zeros. Therefore, `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` will always be 0. As a result, `portal_jumps` remains unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` zeros
- `portal_jumps` is 1

After executing the code, the value of `portal_jumps` remains 1. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 1**
