Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is \(n + 1\).**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions**: 
  - `n > 0`
  - `p` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
  - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros
  - `portal_jumps` is initialized to 1

- **Loop Analysis**:
  - The loop runs for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
  - For each `i`, the loop starts from `p[i]` and goes up to `i-1` (inclusive).
  - During each iteration of the loop, `portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` and then by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
  - Since `dp` is initially a list of zeros, the term `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` contributes 0 to `portal_jumps`.
  - Therefore, `portal_jumps` increments by `1` in each iteration of the inner loop.

- **Total Iterations**:
  - The outer loop runs `n` times.
  - For each `i`, the inner loop runs from `p[i]` to `i-1`, which means the total number of iterations of the inner loop is the sum of `(i - p[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

- **Final Value of `portal_jumps`**:
  - Since the inner loop increments `portal_jumps` by 1 for each iteration, and the total number of iterations is `n`, the final value of `portal_jumps` will be `n + 1`.

- **No Execution Case**:
  - If the list `p` is such that for all `i`, `p[i] >= i`, then the inner loop will never execute, and `portal_jumps` will remain `1`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the value of `portal_jumps` will be `n + 1`.
