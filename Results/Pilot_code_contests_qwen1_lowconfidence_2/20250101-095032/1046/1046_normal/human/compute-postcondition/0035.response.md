The code `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments the value of `portal_jumps` by 1. Given that `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is simply 1, the value of `portal_jumps` is incremented by 1.

The initial conditions remain valid, so:
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\),
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`,
- `portal_jumps` is `2 + 2 \cdot dp[j]`,
- `i` is `n - 1`,
- `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`,
- `j` is `p[i] + 1`.

After executing the code, the updated value of `portal_jumps` is `2 + 2 \cdot dp[j] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, `portal_jumps` is `2 + 2 \cdot dp[j] + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`, `j` is `p[i] + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, `portal_jumps` is `2 + 2 \cdot dp[j] + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`, `j` is `p[i] + 1.`**
