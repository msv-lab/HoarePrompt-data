The code snippet `total_pjumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` updates the value of `total_pjumps`. Initially, `total_pjumps` is given as \(3 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\). Since \(1000000000.0 + 7 = 1000000007\), which is a prime number, the modulo operation will not change the value of \(2n + 1\) because it's less than \(1000000007\). Therefore, \(1 \% 1000000007 = 1\).

Thus, `total_pjumps` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is \(3 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 3\)**
