To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions under which the loop can run:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` in the range from `p[i]` to `i`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `portal_jumps` is 1.

Given the loop `for j in range(p[i], i):`, the loop will only execute if there are valid values for `j` within the specified range. Therefore, we need to ensure that the range `p[i]` to `i` is valid.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Validity**:
   - For the loop to execute, `p[i]` must be less than or equal to `i`. This is because the loop iterates over the range `p[i]` to `i`, inclusive. If `p[i] > i`, the range would be invalid (no elements in the range).

2. **Other States**:
   - The other given states (`n > 0`, `p` list constraints, `dp` list, `portal_jumps`) are not directly related to the range validity of the loop but might be important for the context of the program.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute, the critical condition is that `p[i]` must be less than or equal to `i`.

Thus, the modified state should include this condition:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 1, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`**.
