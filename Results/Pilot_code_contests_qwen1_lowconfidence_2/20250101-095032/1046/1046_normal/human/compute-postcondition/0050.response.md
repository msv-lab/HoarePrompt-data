`total_pjumps` is updated by adding `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. Given that `dp[i]` is already set to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), the operation `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` simplifies to `dp[i]` because `dp[i]` is already an integer within the range of \(0\) to \(1000000000.0 + 6\).

Therefore, the new value of `total_pjumps` is the original value of `total_pjumps` plus `dp[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `total_pjumps` is \(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\)
- `dp[i]` is \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\)

The updated `total_pjumps` is:
\[ \text{new\_total\_pjumps} = \left(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\right) + \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) \]
\[ \text{new\_total\_pjumps} = 3 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2 \]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is \(3 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\)**
