Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.
   - `portal_jumps` is `2 * n + 1`.
   - `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`.
   - `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1` means `i` was already within the range `[0, n-2]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must become `n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` starts from `k + 1` and needs to reach `n - 1`, it means `i` must increment by 1.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1 = (k + 1) + 1 = k + 2`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i` should be `n - 1`, so `k + 2` must be equal to `n - 1`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `p` remains a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` remains a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.
   - `portal_jumps` remains `2 * n + 1`.
   - `i` is now `n - 1`.
   - `p[i]` must still be less than or equal to `i`, but since `i` is `n - 1`, this condition is already satisfied as per the given constraints.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, `portal_jumps` is `2 * n + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`**.
