`portal_jumps` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `portal_jumps` is `1`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`**
