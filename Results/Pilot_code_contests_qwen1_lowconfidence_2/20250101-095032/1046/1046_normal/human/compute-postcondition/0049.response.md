Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\)
- `total_pjumps` is \(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\)

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as \(i < n\).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - Since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, the condition \(i < n\) must still hold true.

### Updated States for Next Iteration:
- `i` is now 2.
- `n` remains unchanged and must still satisfy \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` remains unchanged, as no modifications are specified within the loop.
- `dp` remains unchanged, as no modifications are specified within the loop.
- `total_pjumps` remains unchanged, as no modifications are specified within the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is \(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 2\)**
