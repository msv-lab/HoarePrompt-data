Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`.
   - `portal_jumps` is `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k` (where \(0 \leq k < n\)).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n`, which means `k + 1 < n` or `k < n - 1`.

4. **Modifying the States**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The condition `1 \leq p[i] \leq i` still holds because `p` is defined such that its values are within the bounds of the list up to the current index.
   - `dp` and `portal_jumps` do not change with respect to `i` itself; they depend on the structure of the list and the initial conditions.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was before.
   - `p` remains the same as it was before.
   - `dp` remains the same as it was before.
   - `portal_jumps` remains the same as it was before.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `portal_jumps` is `n + 1`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`**.
