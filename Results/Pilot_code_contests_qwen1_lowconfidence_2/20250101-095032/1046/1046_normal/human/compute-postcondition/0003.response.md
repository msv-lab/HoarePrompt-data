The code initializes the variable `portal_jumps` to 1. This assignment does not affect the values of `n` or the contents of the list `p` or `dp`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `portal_jumps`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 1**
