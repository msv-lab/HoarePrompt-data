The code snippet `print(total_pjumps)` simply prints the value of `total_pjumps`. Since `total_pjumps` is already defined and calculated in the initial state, printing it does not change its value or the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output of the program is the value of `total_pjumps`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `total_pjumps` is \(n \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + n\).

Since no other variables are affected by the print statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is \(n \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + n\)**
