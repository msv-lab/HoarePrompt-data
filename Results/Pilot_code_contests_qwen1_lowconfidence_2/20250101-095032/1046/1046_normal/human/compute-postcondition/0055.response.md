Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, where each element in the list satisfies the condition \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\). It calculates the number of portal jumps required to start off at each room `i` with an odd number of crosses and get back to room `i` with an even number of crosses. The function then computes the total number of portal jumps across all rooms and prints this total. However, there is a discrepancy in the annotations and the code itself; the final values in the `dp` array are incorrectly described. Each element in the `dp` array should be calculated using the given recurrence relation, and the final state of the `dp` array should reflect these calculations. Additionally, the `total_pjumps` computation includes redundant additions of `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` within the loop, which should be removed.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the function will initialize `dp` with a single element, set it to 1, and then compute the total portal jumps as 2, which is correct based on the given conditions.**

**Summary of Final State:**
- After the function concludes, `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each calculated according to the recurrence relation.
- `total_pjumps` is the sum of the elements in the `dp` array, reflecting the total number of portal jumps required to achieve the specified conditions across all rooms.
