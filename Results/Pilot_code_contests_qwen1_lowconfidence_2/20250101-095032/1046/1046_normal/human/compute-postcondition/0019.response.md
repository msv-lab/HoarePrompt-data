The code increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Given that `1000000000.0 + 7` is a constant, `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` will be `1` because 1 modulo any number greater than or equal to 2 is 1. Therefore, `portal_jumps` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `portal_jumps` is `n + 3`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`**
