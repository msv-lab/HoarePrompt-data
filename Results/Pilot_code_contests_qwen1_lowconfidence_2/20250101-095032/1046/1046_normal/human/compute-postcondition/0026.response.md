Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `portal_jumps` is `2 * n + 1`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = k + 1` where `k < n - 1`. The `dp` list is initialized with each element equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` in the range from `p[i]` to `i-1`.
   - For each iteration, `portal_jumps` is updated by adding `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` and `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.

3. **Final Value Calculation**:
   - Since `i` is set to `k + 1` and `k < n - 1`, the loop will run for `i - p[i]` iterations.
   - Each iteration adds `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to `portal_jumps`, so the contribution from this part is `(i - p[i]) * 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
   - Additionally, the loop adds `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` for each `j` in the range, but since `dp[j]` is always `n + 1`, the contribution from this part is `(i - p[i]) * (n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.

4. **Summing Contributions**:
   - The initial value of `portal_jumps` is `n + 1` (since `dp` is initialized to `n + 1` and `portal_jumps` starts at `1`).
   - The total addition from the loop contributions is `(i - p[i]) * (n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
   - The total addition from the `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` contributions is `(i - p[i]) * 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
   - Therefore, the final value of `portal_jumps` is `n + 1 + (i - p[i]) * (n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7) + (i - p[i]) * 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
   - Simplifying, this becomes `n + 1 + (i - p[i]) * (n + 2) % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.

5. **General Case**:
   - Since `i` can vary from `1` to `n-1`, the maximum value of `i - p[i]` is `i - 1` (when `p[i] = 1`).
   - The minimum value of `i - p[i]` is `0` (when `p[i] = i`).
   - Given the constraints, the sum simplifies to `2 * n + 1` because the loop iterates through all possible values of `j` from `p[i]` to `i-1` and the contributions are additive.

Thus, after all iterations, the final state is that `portal_jumps` is `2 * n + 1`.
