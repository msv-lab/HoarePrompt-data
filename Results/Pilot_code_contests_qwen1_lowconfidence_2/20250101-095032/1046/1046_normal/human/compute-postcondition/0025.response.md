The code snippet increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Given that `portal_jumps` was initially `n + 1` plus the original `portal_jumps` value, the new value of `portal_jumps` will be the original value of `portal_jumps` plus 1 modulo `1000000000.0 + 7`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the calculation remains unchanged in its form but its numerical value will be updated.

Other variables are not affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`; `portal_jumps` is the original `portal_jumps` value plus `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`; `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`; `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`; `j` is `p[i] - 1`.**
