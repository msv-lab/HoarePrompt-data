The code snippet `total_pjumps += dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` updates the value of `total_pjumps` by adding `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. Given the initial state, `dp[i]` is already calculated as \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\). Therefore, `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` simplifies to `dp[i]` because `dp[i]` is already an integer within the range specified.

So, the updated value of `total_pjumps` will be:

\[ \text{new } total\_pjumps = \text{original } total\_pjumps + dp[i] \]

Since `dp[i]` is \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), the new value of `total_pjumps` will be:

\[ \text{new } total\_pjumps = (\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ \text{new } total\_pjumps = \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1 + \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) \% (1000000000.0 + 7) \]

Since the modulo operation ensures that the result is less than \(1000000000.0 + 7\), the expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{new } total\_pjumps = \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1 + \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) \]

Therefore, the final value of `total_pjumps` is:

\[ \text{new } total\_pjumps = 2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1 \]

Given the initial state, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `total_pjumps` is \(2 \times \text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1\)**
