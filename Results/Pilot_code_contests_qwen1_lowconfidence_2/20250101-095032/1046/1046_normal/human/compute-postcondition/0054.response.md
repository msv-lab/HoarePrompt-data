The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\). The function does not explicitly return a value based on the given information; however, we know the constraints and the structure of the input.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, where each element in the list satisfies the condition \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\).
