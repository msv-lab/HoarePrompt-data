`portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Given the initial conditions, `dp[j]` is 0 because all elements in `dp` are initialized to 0. Therefore, `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` equals 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 2, `j` starts from `p[i] + 1`, `portal_jumps` is 2**
