Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\).**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization and Constraints:** The initial state provides us with the constraints on `n` and the nature of the lists `p` and `dp`.
- **Inner Loop Behavior:** For each `i` in the outer loop, the inner loop sums up certain values based on previous `dp` values and increments `portal_jumps` accordingly.
- **Outer Loop Iteration Pattern:** Based on the provided output states for 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we observe that the final value of `dp[i]` for all `i` becomes constant after a few iterations and stabilizes at a specific value.
- **Final Value of `dp[i]`:** After examining the provided output states, we notice that `dp[i]` converges to the same value, which is \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\).

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `dp` will be a list of `n` elements, each equal to \(\text{int}((2n + 1) \% (1000000000.0 + 7))\). The other variables (`n`, `p`, `portal_jumps`, `i`) are either irrelevant or follow from the loop's termination conditions.

This concludes the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.
