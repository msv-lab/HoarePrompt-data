According to the code, the loop condition is that `j` should be in the range from `p[i]` to `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`.
- `portal_jumps` is `n + 3`.
- `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`.
- `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

The loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from `p[i]` to `i`. The current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration would be `i - 1` (since the loop increments `j` until it reaches `i`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i` (if possible) or the loop condition needs to change such that `p[i] <= j < i` holds true.

Given that `j` is currently `i - 1`, the loop will continue if `j` is incremented to `i`. However, since the loop increments `j` from `p[i]` to `i`, the next value `j` will take is `i`.

So, we need to update the state such that `j` is now `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `portal_jumps` is `n + 3`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, and `j` is `i`**.
