The code increments `portal_jumps` by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Here, `dp[j]` is initially 0 since `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. Thus, `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is `0 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`, which is 0. Since `portal_jumps` was initially 3, adding 0 does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `portal_jumps` remains 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `portal_jumps` is 3; `j` starts from `p[i] + 2`; `portal_jumps` is 3**
