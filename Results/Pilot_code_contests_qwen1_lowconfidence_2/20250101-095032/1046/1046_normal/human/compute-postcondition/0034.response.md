The code snippet updates the `portal_jumps` variable by adding `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. 

From the initial state analysis, we know:
- `total` is unspecified.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.
- `portal_jumps` is `2 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`.
- `j` is `p[i] + 1`.

The update to `portal_jumps` will add `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` to its current value. The value of `dp[j]` is already known from the initial state to be `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.

Let's denote `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` as `val`.

Therefore, the new value of `portal_jumps` will be:
\[ \text{new\_portal\_jumps} = \text{current\_portal\_jumps} + \text{val} \]

Since `current_portal_jumps` is `2 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`, the new value of `portal_jumps` becomes:
\[ \text{new\_portal\_jumps} = 2 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7) + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7) \]
\[ \text{new\_portal\_jumps} = 2 + 2 \cdot (dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)) \]

Given that `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is the same as `dp[j]` within the modulo operation, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{new\_portal\_jumps} = 2 + 2 \cdot dp[j] \]

So, the final state of the variables is:
- `total` remains unspecified.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `p` remains a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` remains a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`.
- `portal_jumps` is now `2 + 2 \cdot dp[j]`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `p[i]` remains strictly less than `i`.
- `j` remains `p[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`total` is not specified, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, `portal_jumps` is `2 + 2 \cdot dp[j]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`, and `j` is `p[i] + 1`.**
