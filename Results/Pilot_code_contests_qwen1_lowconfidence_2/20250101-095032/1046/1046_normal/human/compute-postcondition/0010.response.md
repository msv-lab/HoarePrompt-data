Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `portal_jumps` is 3.
   - `j` starts from `p[i] + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(p[i], i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs over the range from `p[i]` to `i-1` (since the upper limit is exclusive).

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` starts from `p[i] + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < i`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `j` will increment within the loop, starting from `p[i] + 1` and increasing by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < i`.

6. **Final State:**
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be `p[i] + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented such that it is still less than `i`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `p[i] + 2` for the next iteration.

7. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains the same: `n` is greater than 0.
   - `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `portal_jumps` remains the same: `portal_jumps` is 3.
   - `j` starts from `p[i] + 2` for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `portal_jumps` is 3; `j` starts from `p[i] + 2`; `portal_jumps` is 3**
