Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `portal_jumps` is 2.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `p[i]` to `i-1`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `i`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been incremented from `p[i]` to `i-1` (inclusive).

4. **Next Iteration Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`.
   - Since `j` starts from `p[i]` and increments by 1, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j + 1` must be less than `i` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `p` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains a list of `n` zeros.
   - `portal_jumps` remains 2.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `j` will start from `p[i] + 1`.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `p` remains the same list of integers.
- `dp` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `portal_jumps` remains 2.
- `i` remains the same.
- `j` starts from `p[i] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 2, `i` is the same as the previous `i`, and `j` starts from `p[i] + 1`**.

However, since we only need to adjust the states explicitly, the relevant states to adjust are:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `portal_jumps` is 2, `j` starts from `p[i] + 1`**.
