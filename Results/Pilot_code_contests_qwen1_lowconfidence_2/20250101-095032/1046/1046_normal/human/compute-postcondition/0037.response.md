The code snippet `portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` updates the value of `portal_jumps`. According to the initial state, `dp[j]` is equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`. Since `j` is `p[i] + 2` and `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`, and given that `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), we know that `p[i]` is a valid index in the list `dp`. Therefore, `dp[j]` will take a value from the list `dp`.

Given the formula `portal_jumps = 2 + 2 * dp[j] + 1`, updating `portal_jumps` with `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` means we are adding `dp[j]` to `portal_jumps`. The updated value of `portal_jumps` will be:

\[ portal\_jumps = 2 + 2 * dp[j] + 1 + dp[j] = 3 + 3 * dp[j] \]

Since `dp[j]` is `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, we substitute this into the equation:

\[ portal\_jumps = 3 + 3 * int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7)) \]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, `portal_jumps` is `3 + 3 * int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p[i]` is strictly less than `i`, `j` is `p[i] + 2.`**
