Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `portal_jumps` is `n + 3 + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, and `j` is `i`.**
