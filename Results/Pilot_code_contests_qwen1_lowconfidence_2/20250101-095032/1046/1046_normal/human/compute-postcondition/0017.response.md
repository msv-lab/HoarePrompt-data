Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`.
- `portal_jumps` is `1`.
- `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(p[i], i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop (`j`):**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `p[i]` to `i` (exclusive). This means the loop will run as long as `p[i] <= j < i`.
   - Therefore, the loop can only execute if `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`, we know that `i < n`.
   - Given that `1 \leq p[i] \leq i`, it is guaranteed that `p[i]` is within the valid range for `i`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The key condition here is ensuring that `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. We already know this condition holds true because of the constraints given.
   - However, we need to ensure that `p[i]` is explicitly included in the initial state since it directly influences the loop's execution.

### Final State:
Given the analysis, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop can execute are:

- Ensure `p[i]` is defined and is less than or equal to `i`.

Thus, the final state should include:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`.
- `portal_jumps` is `1`.
- `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`.
- `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `n + 1`, `portal_jumps` is `1`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k < n - 1`, `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`**
