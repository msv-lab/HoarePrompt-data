The code sets `portal_jumps` to 1, which changes its value from `2 * n + 1` to 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `int((2 * n + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7))`; `portal_jumps` is 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `p[i]` is less than or equal to `i`**
