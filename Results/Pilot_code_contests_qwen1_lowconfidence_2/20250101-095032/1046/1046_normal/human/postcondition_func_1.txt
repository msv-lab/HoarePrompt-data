The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, where each element in the list satisfies the condition \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\). It calculates the number of portal jumps required to start off at each room `i` with an odd number of crosses and get back to room `i` with an even number of crosses. The function then computes the total number of portal jumps across all rooms and prints this total. However, there is a discrepancy in the annotations and the code itself; the final values in the `dp` array are incorrectly described. Each element in the `dp` array should be calculated using the given recurrence relation, and the final state of the `dp` array should reflect these calculations. Additionally, the `total_pjumps` computation includes redundant additions of `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` within the loop, which should be removed.
