#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an iterator `line` yielding strings, where the first string provides the number of rooms `n`, and the second string provides `n` space-separated integers representing the sequence `P`. It reads these values, converts them appropriately, and yields a tuple containing `n` and `P`. After executing the function, the state of the program is such that `line` becomes an empty iterator, `n` holds the number of rooms read from the first string, and `P` is a list of `n-1` elements, where each element is an integer derived from the second string by converting it to an integer and subtracting 1. The function handles the case where `line` is exhausted and yields the parsed data. No edge cases are explicitly mentioned in the annotations or the code, but it is assumed that `line` provides exactly two strings as expected, and these strings contain valid integers. If `line` does not provide the expected format, the function will raise a `StopIteration` exception.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, where each element in the list satisfies the condition \(1 \leq p[i] \leq i\). It calculates the number of portal jumps required to start off at each room `i` with an odd number of crosses and get back to room `i` with an even number of crosses. The function then computes the total number of portal jumps across all rooms and prints this total. However, there is a discrepancy in the annotations and the code itself; the final values in the `dp` array are incorrectly described. Each element in the `dp` array should be calculated using the given recurrence relation, and the final state of the `dp` array should reflect these calculations. Additionally, the `total_pjumps` computation includes redundant additions of `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` within the loop, which should be removed.
