Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw. Specifically, it incorrectly handles the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero. According to the problem statement, if both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero, they are not on bad terms with any other sardines. However, the current implementation continues to the next iteration without properly counting this case.

Here is a specific example that highlights the issue:

**Input:**
```
3
0 0
1 1
-1 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the sardines (0, 0), (1, 1), and (-1, -1) can be chosen individually or as pairs, resulting in 4 valid sets. However, the program only counts 3 sets because it skips over the zero case.

To fix this, the program should handle the zero case separately. Here's a modified version of the code that addresses this issue:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
ns = []
d = defaultdict(int)
zero_count = 0

for i in range(n):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0 and b == 0:
        zero_count += 1
        continue
    ns.append((a, b))
    if a and b:
        s = 1 if a * b >= 0 else -1
        g = func_1(abs(a), abs(b))
        m1 = (s * abs(a) / g, abs(b) / g)
        m2 = (-s * abs(b) / g, abs(a) / g)
    elif a == 0 and b != 0:
        m1 = (0, 1)
        m2 = (1, 0)
    elif b == 0 and a != 0:
        m1 = (1, 0)
        m2 = (0, 1)
    d[m1] += 1
    d[m2] += 0

pre = 1
if zero_count > 0:
    pre = pow(2, zero_count, MOD)

for k in d.keys():
    if k[0] < 0:
        assert (k[1], -k[0]) in d
        continue
    elif k[0] == 0:
        pre = pre * d[k] % MOD
    else:
        k1 = k
        k2 = (-k[1], k[0])
        tot = pow(2, d[k1], MOD) + pow(2, d[k2], MOD) - 1
        pre = pre * tot % MOD

print((pre - 1 + MOD) % MOD)

def func_1(a, b):
    if a % b == 0:
        return b
    return func_1(b, a % b)
```

This version correctly handles the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero and ensures that all valid sets are counted.
