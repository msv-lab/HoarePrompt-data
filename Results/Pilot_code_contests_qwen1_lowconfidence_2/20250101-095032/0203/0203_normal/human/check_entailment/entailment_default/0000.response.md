Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of pairs of sardines' deliciousness and fragrantness values to group them. However, the logic for determining if two sardines are on bad terms is flawed.

The condition for two sardines being on bad terms is given by \(A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0\). The program incorrectly groups sardines based on their GCD, which does not capture this relationship.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3
1 2
-1 1
2 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will incorrectly group the sardines and fail to count the valid combinations. For instance, it might not properly handle the case where sardines have different GCD values but still satisfy the bad term condition.

The program's logic for grouping sardines based on their GCD does not ensure that sardines satisfying \(A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0\) are treated appropriately. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
