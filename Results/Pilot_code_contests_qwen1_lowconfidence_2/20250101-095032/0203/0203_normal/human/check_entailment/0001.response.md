Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. One significant issue is in the handling of the GCD calculation and the subsequent processing of pairs. Let's break down the issues:

1. **GCD Calculation Issue**: The `func_1` function is intended to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the recursive implementation is incorrect because it doesn't handle the base case properly. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially infinite recursion.

2. **Pair Handling Issue**: The program attempts to group sardines by their slopes, but it does not correctly handle all possible cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that two sardines are on bad terms if \( A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0 \). The current implementation does not fully cover this condition, leading to potential mismatches.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases such as sardines with zero coordinates or sardines with the same slope but different intercepts. These scenarios are crucial for determining whether sardines are on bad terms.

Given these issues, let's consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 0
-1 0
0 1
```

For this input:
- The first and second sardines have coordinates \((1, 0)\) and \((-1, 0)\).
- The third sardine has coordinates \((0, 1)\).

These sardines do not form a bad pair because \(1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 0 = -1 \neq 0\). Similarly, the first and third, and the second and third sardines also do not form a bad pair.

However, the program incorrectly treats these sardines as being on bad terms due to its faulty GCD-based approach, leading to an incorrect count of valid sets.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the output is **False**.
