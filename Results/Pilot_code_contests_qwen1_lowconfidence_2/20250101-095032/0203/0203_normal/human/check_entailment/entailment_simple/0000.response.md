Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, there are several issues that prevent the program from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. However, it is incorrectly named as `func_1` and does not serve its intended purpose in the context of the problem.
   - The GCD computation should be used to normalize the pairs \((a_i, b_i)\) so that each pair represents a unique combination that can be used to form subsets of sardines without conflict.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the GCD and is instead used to form pairs \((m1, m2)\) which are not necessarily unique or normalized.

2. **Normalization and Pair Formation:**
   - The pairs \((m1, m2)\) should be formed based on the normalized values of \((a_i, b_i)\). The program currently forms pairs based on conditions involving signs and absolute values, but it does not properly normalize the pairs.
   - The logic for forming pairs \((m1, m2)\) is flawed and does not ensure that each pair represents a unique combination of sardines that can coexist in the cooler.

3. **Counting Valid Subsets:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid subsets using the keys in the dictionary `d`. However, the way the pairs are formed and stored in `d` does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.
   - The program uses `pow(2, d[k1], MOD) + pow(2, d[k2], MOD) - 1` to calculate the number of valid subsets for each pair, but this calculation does not correctly reflect the problem's constraints.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Normalize Pairs:**
   - Compute the GCD of each pair \((a_i, b_i)\) and use it to normalize the pairs.
   - Store the normalized pairs in a dictionary to ensure uniqueness.

2. **Count Valid Subsets:**
   - Use dynamic programming or bit manipulation to count the number of valid subsets based on the normalized pairs.
   - Ensure that the count accounts for the constraints of the problem and handles edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to properly normalize the pairs and count the valid subsets. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
