You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have caught N sardines. The deliciousness and fragrantness of the i-th sardine is A_i and B_i, respectively.

We will choose one or more of these sardines and put them into a cooler. However, two sardines on bad terms cannot be chosen at the same time.

The i-th and j-th sardines (i \neq j) are on bad terms if and only if A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0.

In how many ways can we choose the set of sardines to put into the cooler? Since the count can be enormous, print it modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* -10^{18} \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^{18}

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw. Specifically, it incorrectly handles the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero. According to the problem statement, if both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero, they are not on bad terms with any other sardines. However, the current implementation continues to the next iteration without properly counting this case.

Here is a specific example that highlights the issue:

**Input:**
```
3
0 0
1 1
-1 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the sardines (0, 0), (1, 1), and (-1, -1) can be chosen individually or as pairs, resulting in 4 valid sets. However, the program only counts 3 sets because it skips over the zero case.

To fix this, the program should handle the zero case separately. Here's a modified version of the code that addresses this issue:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
ns = []
d = defaultdict(int)
zero_count = 0

for i in range(n):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0 and b == 0:
        zero_count += 1
        continue
    ns.append((a, b))
    if a and b:
        s = 1 if a * b >= 0 else -1
        g = func_1(abs(a), abs(b))
        m1 = (s * abs(a) / g, abs(b) / g)
        m2 = (-s * abs(b) / g, abs(a) / g)
    elif a == 0 and b != 0:
        m1 = (0, 1)
        m2 = (1, 0)
    elif b == 0 and a != 0:
        m1 = (1, 0)
        m2 = (0, 1)
    d[m1] += 1
    d[m2] += 0

pre = 1
if zero_count > 0:
    pre = pow(2, zero_count, MOD)

for k in d.keys():
    if k[0] < 0:
        assert (k[1], -k[0]) in d
        continue
    elif k[0] == 0:
        pre = pre * d[k] % MOD
    else:
        k1 = k
        k2 = (-k[1], k[0])
        tot = pow(2, d[k1], MOD) + pow(2, d[k2], MOD) - 1
        pre = pre * tot % MOD

print((pre - 1 + MOD) % MOD)

def func_1(a, b):
    if a % b == 0:
        return b
    return func_1(b, a % b)
```

This version correctly handles the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero and ensures that all valid sets are counted.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
