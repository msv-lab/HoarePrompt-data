You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have caught N sardines. The deliciousness and fragrantness of the i-th sardine is A_i and B_i, respectively.

We will choose one or more of these sardines and put them into a cooler. However, two sardines on bad terms cannot be chosen at the same time.

The i-th and j-th sardines (i \neq j) are on bad terms if and only if A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0.

In how many ways can we choose the set of sardines to put into the cooler? Since the count can be enormous, print it modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* -10^{18} \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^{18}

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. One significant issue is in the handling of the GCD calculation and the subsequent processing of pairs. Let's break down the issues:

1. **GCD Calculation Issue**: The `func_1` function is intended to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the recursive implementation is incorrect because it doesn't handle the base case properly. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially infinite recursion.

2. **Pair Handling Issue**: The program attempts to group sardines by their slopes, but it does not correctly handle all possible cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that two sardines are on bad terms if \( A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0 \). The current implementation does not fully cover this condition, leading to potential mismatches.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases such as sardines with zero coordinates or sardines with the same slope but different intercepts. These scenarios are crucial for determining whether sardines are on bad terms.

Given these issues, let's consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 0
-1 0
0 1
```

For this input:
- The first and second sardines have coordinates \((1, 0)\) and \((-1, 0)\).
- The third sardine has coordinates \((0, 1)\).

These sardines do not form a bad pair because \(1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 0 = -1 \neq 0\). Similarly, the first and third, and the second and third sardines also do not form a bad pair.

However, the program incorrectly treats these sardines as being on bad terms due to its faulty GCD-based approach, leading to an incorrect count of valid sets.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the output is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Each element in a and b satisfies -10^18 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^18.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
