Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of valid sets of sardines that can be chosen such that no two sardines are on bad terms (defined by the condition \(A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0\)).

2. **Representation of Sardines**: The program uses a dictionary `d` to store the normalized pairs of (deliciousness, fragrantness) values. Normalization ensures that for each pair \((a, b)\), the greatest common divisor (GCD) is used to reduce the pair to its simplest form. This helps in identifying equivalent pairs that are on bad terms with each other.

3. **Normalization Process**: The normalization process involves computing the GCD of the absolute values of `a` and `b`. This ensures that all pairs like \((a, b)\) and \((-a, -b)\) are treated as the same. The sign of the pair is preserved separately, leading to four possible normalized forms for each pair: \((x, y)\), \((-x, y)\), \((x, -y)\), and \((-x, -y)\).

4. **Counting Valid Sets**: For each unique normalized pair, the program calculates the number of valid sets using dynamic programming principles. It considers both positive and negative versions of the pair and uses bitwise operations to account for valid combinations.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, the program uses modulo \(1000000007\) to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

6. **Handling Special Cases**: The program correctly handles special cases where `a` or `b` is zero, and it avoids redundant calculations by ensuring that each unique pair is processed only once.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description by:
- Correctly normalizing the pairs to handle equivalent pairs.
- Efficiently counting the number of valid sets of sardines.
- Using modulo arithmetic to handle large numbers.
- Handling special cases appropriately.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, making it correct.
