Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for every potential case:

1. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function is intended to calculate the GCD of two numbers, but it is not being used correctly within the main program. The GCD calculation is necessary for normalizing the coordinates of the sardines, but the function is not being called in a way that would properly normalize the coordinates.

2. **Normalization of Coordinates**: The code attempts to normalize the coordinates of the sardines using the GCD, but this normalization step is incomplete and not fully integrated into the logic that determines which sardines can be chosen together. Specifically, the logic for determining whether sardines are on bad terms and handling their counts is flawed.

3. **Handling Zero Values**: The code handles the case where both `A_i` and `B_i` are zero incorrectly. It continues without processing such sardines, which is not appropriate because sardines with both zero values can be chosen independently of other sardines.

4. **Counting Valid Combinations**: The logic for counting the number of valid combinations of sardines is flawed. The code uses a dictionary to count occurrences of normalized coordinates but does not correctly account for the fact that sardines with different normalized coordinates can still be chosen independently if they are not on bad terms with each other.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
