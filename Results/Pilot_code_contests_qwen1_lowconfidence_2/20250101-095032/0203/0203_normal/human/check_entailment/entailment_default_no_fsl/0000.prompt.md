You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have caught N sardines. The deliciousness and fragrantness of the i-th sardine is A_i and B_i, respectively.

We will choose one or more of these sardines and put them into a cooler. However, two sardines on bad terms cannot be chosen at the same time.

The i-th and j-th sardines (i \neq j) are on bad terms if and only if A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0.

In how many ways can we choose the set of sardines to put into the cooler? Since the count can be enormous, print it modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* -10^{18} \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^{18}

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1
:
A_N B_N


Output

Print the count modulo 1000000007.

Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(raw_input())
ns = []
d = defaultdict(int)
for i in xrange(n):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ns.append((a, b))
    if a and b:
        s = 1 if a * b >= 0 else -1
        g = func_1(abs(a), abs(b))
        m1 = (s * abs(a) / g, abs(b) / g)
        m2 = (-s * abs(b) / g, abs(a) / g)
    elif a == 0 and b == 0:
        continue
    elif a == 0:
        m1 = (1, 0)
        m2 = (0, 1)
    elif b == 0:
        m1 = (0, 1)
        m2 = (1, 0)
    d[m1] += 1
    d[m2] += 0
pre = 1
for k in d.keys():
    if k[0] < 0:
        assert (k[1], -k[0]) in d
        continue
    elif k[0] == 0:
        pre = pre * d[k] % MOD
    else:
        k1 = k
        k2 = (-k[1], k[0])
        tot = pow(2, d[k1], MOD) + pow(2, d[k2], MOD) - 1
        pre = pre * tot % MOD
print(pre - 1 + MOD) % MOD

def func_1(a, b):
    if a % b == 0:
        return b
    return func_1(b, a % b)


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers representing the deliciousness and fragrantness of the sardines, respectively. The length of both lists is equal and satisfies \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element in both lists satisfies \(-10^{18} \leq a[i], b[i] \leq 10^{18}\).

The function recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `a` and `b`. If `a % b == 0`, the function returns the list `b`. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call with the arguments swapped (`b` becomes the new `a` and `a % b` becomes the new `b`).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a list of integers. This list can either be the original list `b` if the condition `a % b == 0` is met, or the result of the GCD computation if the condition is not met.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
