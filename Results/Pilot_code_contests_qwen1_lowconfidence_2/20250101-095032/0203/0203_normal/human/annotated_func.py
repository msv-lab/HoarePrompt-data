#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of the sardines, and b is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines, such that the length of a is equal to the length of b, and both lengths satisfy 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in a and b satisfies -10^18 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^18.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of the sardines, and b is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines, such that the length of a is equal to the length of b, and both lengths satisfy 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in a and b satisfies -10^18 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^18, and (a % b != 0)
    return func_1(b, a % b)
    #The program returns the result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)` where `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines, and `a % b` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of the sardines modulo their corresponding fragrantness values
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers representing the deliciousness and fragrantness of the sardines, respectively. The length of both lists is equal and satisfies \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element in both lists satisfies \(-10^{18} \leq a[i], b[i] \leq 10^{18}\).

The function recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `a` and `b`. If `a % b == 0`, the function returns the list `b`. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call with the arguments swapped (`b` becomes the new `a` and `a % b` becomes the new `b`).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a list of integers. This list can either be the original list `b` if the condition `a % b == 0` is met, or the result of the GCD computation if the condition is not met.
