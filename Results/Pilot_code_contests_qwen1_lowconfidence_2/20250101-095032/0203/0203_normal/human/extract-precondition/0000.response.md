Precondition: **a is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of the sardines, and b is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines, such that the length of a is equal to the length of b, and both lengths satisfy 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in a and b satisfies -10^18 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^18.**
