The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are lists of integers representing the deliciousness and fragrantness of the sardines, respectively. The length of both lists is equal and satisfies 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element in both lists satisfies -10^18 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^18.

The function returns either:
- Case_1: The list `b` of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines.
- Case_2: The result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)` where `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines, and `a % b` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of the sardines modulo their corresponding fragrantness values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `a` and `b` and return either the list `b` or the result of a recursive call to `func_1` with the lists swapped and the deliciousness list modulo the fragrantness list.
