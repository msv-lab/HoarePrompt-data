Postcondition: ***a is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of the sardines, and b is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of the sardines. Both lists have the same length, which satisfies 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element in both lists satisfies -10^18 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^18. Furthermore, the sum of elements in a is divisible by the sum of elements in b.***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the condition specified in the if statement, ensuring that the sum of elements in list `a` is divisible by the sum of elements in list `b`.
