The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers representing the deliciousness and fragrantness of the sardines, respectively. The length of both lists is equal and satisfies \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element in both lists satisfies \(-10^{18} \leq a[i], b[i] \leq 10^{18}\).

The function recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `a` and `b`. If `a % b == 0`, the function returns the list `b`. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call with the arguments swapped (`b` becomes the new `a` and `a % b` becomes the new `b`).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a list of integers. This list can either be the original list `b` if the condition `a % b == 0` is met, or the result of the GCD computation if the condition is not met.
