The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5`. It then constructs a graph representing the connections between `n` rooms using `m` passages. After constructing the graph, it calls `func_1(graph)` to process the graph and obtain certain information. If the first element of the list returned by `func_1(graph)` is `-1`, it prints 'No' and terminates without further processing. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the elements of the list returned by `func_1(graph)` starting from the second element. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs for `n` and `m`, and the presence of specific structures within the graph that could affect the output of `func_1(graph)`.
