Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identified that the program meets the problem description and the provided annotated version supports this conclusion. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs the graph from the input passages, ensuring that each room is connected appropriately.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The `func_1` function performs a BFS starting from Room 1 (node 0 in the list) to determine the shortest path to every other room. This ensures that the signposts point to the room that minimizes the number of passages to reach Room 1.
3. **Output Generation**: The `func_2` function processes the results of the BFS and outputs the correct signpost configuration for each room. If the BFS fails to find a valid path to Room 1 for any room, it correctly outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by the required signpost configurations.
4. **Annotations Confirm Correctness**: The annotated version confirms that the BFS correctly identifies the shortest paths and sets up the signposts accordingly. The logic for handling the case where `-1` is present in the result (indicating an invalid path) is also correctly implemented.

Given the detailed annotations and the logical structure of the program, the original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program adheres to the problem requirements and handles all necessary cases correctly. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
