Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to place signposts in each room (except Room 1) such that starting from any room (except Room 1) and repeatedly moving to the room indicated by the signpost leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of passages possible.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Implements a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms. The `post` array keeps track of the last node visited in the path to each node, ensuring the minimum path to Room 1 is recorded.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Constructs the graph from the input and calls `func_1` to get the `post` array. If any room cannot reach Room 1 (indicated by `-1` in the `post` array), it prints `No`. Otherwise, it prints `Yes` followed by the signpost values for each room.
   - **Function `func_3`**: Handles the printing of the results, ensuring that the output format matches the problem description.

3. **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at different points, validating the flow and correctness of the BFS implementation and the subsequent placement of signposts.

Given the BFS implementation and the correct handling of the output, the program correctly determines and prints the signpost placements for each room, ensuring that starting from any room (except Room 1) and repeatedly moving to the room indicated by the signpost leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of passages. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
