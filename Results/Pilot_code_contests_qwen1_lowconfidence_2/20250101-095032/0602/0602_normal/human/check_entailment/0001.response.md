Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given passages.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The `func_1` function uses BFS to determine the shortest path to Room 1 from each room. This ensures that the signposts point to the room that minimizes the number of passages traveled to reach Room 1.
3. **Output Generation**: The `func_2` function generates the output based on the shortest paths found by the BFS. It prints `Yes` followed by the room numbers indicating the signposts for each room, starting from Room 2 to Room N.
4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program handles the case where there might be no valid signposts by checking if `-1` is in the post array returned by `func_1`. If `-1` is found, it indicates that not all rooms have a valid shortest path to Room 1, and thus prints `No`.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program seems to handle all necessary cases correctly. Since I couldn't find any specific input that would make the program fail to meet the requirements, the correctness is verified as **True**.
