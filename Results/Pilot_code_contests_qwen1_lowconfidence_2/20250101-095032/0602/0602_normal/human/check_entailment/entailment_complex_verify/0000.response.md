Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `m` and constructs an adjacency list representation of the cave's rooms and passages. Each room is represented by an index, and the passages are added bidirectionally.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - The `func_1` function performs a BFS starting from Room 1 (index 0). It calculates the shortest distance to Room 1 for each room and records the previous room in the path (`post` array). This ensures that the path to Room 1 from any other room is optimal.

3. **Post-processing**:
   - After running the BFS, the program checks if any room cannot reach Room 1. If any room cannot reach Room 1 (indicated by `-1` in the `post` array), it outputs `No`. Otherwise, it outputs `Yes` and the signpost values for each room (excluding Room 1).

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The `func_3` function is used to print the results. It handles the printing of the results according to the specified format and parameters.

Based on the annotated version, the program handles all necessary steps to ensure that the signposts are placed correctly, and the BFS guarantees the optimal paths. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
