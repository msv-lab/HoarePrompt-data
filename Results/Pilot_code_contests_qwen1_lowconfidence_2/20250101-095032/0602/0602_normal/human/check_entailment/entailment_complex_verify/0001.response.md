Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Hereâ€™s a detailed justification:

1. **Graph Construction and Representation**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the cave's rooms using the input passages. This ensures that the graph accurately reflects the connections between the rooms.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation**:
   - The `func_1` function implements a DFS to determine the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms. The function uses a queue (`q`) and a list of depths (`depth`) to track the shortest distances and post-order traversal (`post`) to store the last node visited before reaching each node.
   - The BFS logic in `func_1` ensures that the `post` array contains the room that is the nearest neighbor for each room, which aligns with the requirement to minimize the number of passages traveled to reach Room 1.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly checks if all rooms have a valid shortest path to Room 1. If any room does not have a valid path, it prints "No" and exits.
   - If all rooms have valid paths, it prints "Yes" followed by the appropriate signpost directions, ensuring that starting from each room and following the signposts leads to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program handles the case where Room 1 (start room) is not reachable from other rooms by checking for `-1` in the `post` array. This ensures that the program does not attempt to generate signposts for rooms that cannot be reached.

Given the detailed annotations and the problem description, the program correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
