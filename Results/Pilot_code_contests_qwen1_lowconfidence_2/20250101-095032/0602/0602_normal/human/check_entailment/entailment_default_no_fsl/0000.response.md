Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the solution for placing signposts in the cave. Specifically, the `func_1` function is performing a DFS to find the shortest path from the start room (Room 1) to all other rooms, but it does not ensure that starting from any room except Room 1 and repeatedly moving to the room indicated by the signpost will always lead to Room 1 after traversing the minimum number of passages possible.

The issue lies in how the `func_1` function handles the paths. It only returns the last node `w` that was visited in the path leading to node `v`, which does not guarantee that the path from any room to Room 1 is the shortest or that it will lead to Room 1. The code should perform a BFS or a similar traversal to ensure that the shortest path is found and followed.

To fix this, the code should use a BFS to find the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms and then use these paths to set the signposts. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(graph, start=0):
    from collections import deque
    used = [False] * len(graph)
    used[start] = True
    q = deque([start])
    depth = [-1] * len(graph)
    parent = [-1] * len(graph)
    depth[0] = 0
    while q:
        v = q.popleft()
        for w in graph[v]:
            if not used[w]:
                used[w] = True
                depth[w] = depth[v] + 1
                parent[w] = v
                q.append(w)
    return parent
```

With this corrected `func_1` function, the `func_2` function would correctly place the signposts pointing to the room that leads to Room 1 in the shortest path.
