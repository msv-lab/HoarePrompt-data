Final: **True**

Reasoning:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to solve the problem. The BFS ensures that the minimum number of passages are traversed to reach Room 1 from any other room.
- The program constructs the graph, performs BFS starting from Room 1, and determines the optimal signpost placement for each room.
- The output hints confirm that `func_3` simply prints the values passed to it without altering the program's logic or structure.
- The provided code and the BFS approach correctly handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.
- Since the output hints do not indicate any issues with the program's functionality, and the code adheres to the problem requirements, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
