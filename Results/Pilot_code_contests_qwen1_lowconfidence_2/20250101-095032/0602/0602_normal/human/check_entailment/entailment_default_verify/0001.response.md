Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the solution. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the cave’s rooms and passages.
2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: The `func_1` function uses BFS to determine the shortest path from each room to Room 1. This ensures that the signposts point to the room that minimizes the number of passages traveled to reach Room 1.
3. **Output Generation**: The `func_2` function generates the correct output based on the shortest paths found by `func_1`. It prints `Yes` followed by the room numbers indicating the signposts for each room, starting from Room 2 to Room N.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where there might be no valid signposts by checking if `-1` is in the post array returned by `func_1`. If `-1` is found, it indicates that not all rooms have a valid shortest path to Room 1, and thus prints `No`.

The provided output hints for `func_3` indicate that it simply prints values with specified separators, end characters, etc., without affecting the core logic of the program. Therefore, the program remains correct based on the problem description and the given output hints.
