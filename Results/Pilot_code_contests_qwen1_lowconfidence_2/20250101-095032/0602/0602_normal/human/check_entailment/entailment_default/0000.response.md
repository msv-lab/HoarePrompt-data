Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms, but it does not guarantee that the signposts placed in each room will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps for every room.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Given:
```
N = 4
M = 4
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
B = [2, 3, 4, 2]
```

This forms a cycle: Room 1 -> Room 2 -> Room 3 -> Room 4 -> Room 2.

When the code runs, it will use the DFS to determine the paths. However, the DFS might not necessarily return the correct signposts for each room to ensure the minimum number of steps back to Room 1. In this case, the code will return:
```
Yes
2
3
2
```

However, the correct signposts should be:
```
Yes
1
1
1
1
```

Because the minimum number of steps to return to Room 1 from any other room is always 1 step, regardless of the current room. The code does not ensure this, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
