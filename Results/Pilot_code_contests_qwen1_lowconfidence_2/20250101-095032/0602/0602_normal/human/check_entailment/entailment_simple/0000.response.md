Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - The program reads the number of rooms `n` and passages `m`.
   - It constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using `graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]`.
   - For each passage, it adds both rooms to each other’s adjacency list, ensuring bidirectional connectivity.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - The `func_1` function performs a BFS starting from Room 1 (node 0 in the graph).
   - It uses a queue (`q`) to traverse the graph level by level.
   - The `depth` array keeps track of the shortest distance from Room 1 to each room.
   - The `post` array stores the parent node of each node in the shortest path from Room 1 to each node.
   - The BFS ensures that the shortest path from Room 1 to each room is found, and the `post` array is populated accordingly.

3. **Signpost Placement**:
   - After obtaining the `post` array, the program checks if any room is unreachable (i.e., `-1` in `post`).
   - If any room is unreachable, the program prints "No" and exits.
   - Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the signpost values for each room (excluding Room 1).

### Key Points:

- **Reachability**: The BFS ensures that every room is reachable from Room 1, and the `post` array correctly indicates the next room to visit to reach Room 1 in the shortest path.
- **Correct Output**: The program outputs the correct signpost values for each room, ensuring that starting from any room (except Room 1) and following the signposts leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
