Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to determine the shortest path from each room to Room 1. The BFS ensures that the minimum number of passages are traversed to reach Room 1 from any other room. The program then places the signposts accordingly to ensure that starting from any room (except Room 1), repeatedly moving to the room indicated by the signpost leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

Hereâ€™s a brief walkthrough of how the program works:
1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the cave's rooms and passages.
2. **BFS Initialization**: It initializes a BFS traversal starting from Room 1 (index 0).
3. **Distance Calculation**: During the BFS, it calculates the shortest distance to Room 1 for each room and records the previous room in the path (`post` array).
4. **Output Determination**: After the BFS completes, it checks if all rooms (except Room 1) have valid paths to Room 1. If any room cannot reach Room 1, it outputs `No`. Otherwise, it outputs `Yes` followed by the signpost values for each room.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, this implementation handles all potential cases correctly. The BFS guarantees that the signposts are placed optimally to meet the condition specified in the problem description.
