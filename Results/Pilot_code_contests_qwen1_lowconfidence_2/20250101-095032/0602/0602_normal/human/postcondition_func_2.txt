The function `func_3` accepts a tuple `args` containing two integers representing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M), and a dictionary `kwargs` that may contain optional parameters such as `sep` (separator), `file` (output stream), `end` (ending character), and `flush` (flushing the output stream). The function does not return any value. After executing the function, it prints the values of `N` and `M` separated by `sep` (default space) and followed by `end` (default newline), and optionally flushes the output stream if specified.
