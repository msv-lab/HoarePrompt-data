The code `q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. This affects the list `q`, but does not change the values of `graph[v]`, `depth[w]`, `used[w]`, or `depth[v]`. The value of `post[v]` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least two elements, `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `used[w]` is `True`, `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is set to `w`, and `q` contains the value of `w` appended to its end.**
