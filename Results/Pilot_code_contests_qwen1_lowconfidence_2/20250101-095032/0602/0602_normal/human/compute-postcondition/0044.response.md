Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list where `used[w]` is `True` for the current `w`, `q` is a list containing at least two elements with `w` being one of them, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is now equal to `w` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`). Otherwise, no changes are made to `depth[v]` and `post[v]`.***
