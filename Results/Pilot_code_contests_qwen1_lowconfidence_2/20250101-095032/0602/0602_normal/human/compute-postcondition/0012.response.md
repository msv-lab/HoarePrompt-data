`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. Given the initial state, `args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, and `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`. Since the condition `not at_start` must be true, the if part of the code is executed, which writes `str(x)` to `file`.

After the code is executed, the following changes occur:
- The value of `file` remains unchanged, but it now contains the value of `sep` because the if part was executed.
- `file.write(str(x))` modifies the content of `file` by appending `str(x)` to it.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` now contains the value of `sep` since the condition `not at_start` must be true, leading to the execution of the if part, and the content of `file` has been modified to include `str(x)`.**
