The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers; `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which is either the original value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '; `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which is either the original value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`.**
