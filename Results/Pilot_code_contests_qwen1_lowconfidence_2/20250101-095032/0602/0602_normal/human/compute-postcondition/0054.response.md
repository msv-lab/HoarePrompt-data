Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list where `used[w]` is `True`, `q` is a list containing at least two elements including an unvisited neighbor `w` (which is appended to `q` if the condition is met), `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is now equal to `w` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), otherwise it remains unchanged. This holds true whether the condition `not used[w]` is satisfied or not since there is no else part changing these states.***
