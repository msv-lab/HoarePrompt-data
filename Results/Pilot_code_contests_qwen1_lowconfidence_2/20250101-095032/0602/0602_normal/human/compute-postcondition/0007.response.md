The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object referenced by `file`. Before this operation, `file` has written `sep` to itself if `at_start` is `False`. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact content that will be written. But we know the following:

- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
- `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
- `file` has written `sep` to itself if `at_start` is `False`.

Since `x` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `file.write(str(x))` will write `str(x)` to `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `file` has written `sep` to itself if `at_start` is `False`, and `file` has also written `str(x)` to itself.**
