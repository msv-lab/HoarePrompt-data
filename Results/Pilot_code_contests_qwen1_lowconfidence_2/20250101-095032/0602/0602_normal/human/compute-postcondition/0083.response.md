The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `graph`, which is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, and `start`, which is an integer representing the starting room. The `start` parameter has a default value of 0, corresponding to Room 1.

After executing the function body, the function returns a dictionary where each key is a reachable node, and the value is the last node `w` that was visited in the path leading to node `v` for all reachable nodes `v`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists `graph` representing the adjacency list of the cave's rooms and an integer `start` representing the starting room, and return a dictionary where each key is a reachable node and the value is the last node visited in the path leading to that node.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `graph`, a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, and a parameter `start`, an integer representing the starting room. It returns a dictionary where the key is a reachable node and the value is the last node `w` that was visited in the path leading to node `v` for all reachable nodes `v`.**
