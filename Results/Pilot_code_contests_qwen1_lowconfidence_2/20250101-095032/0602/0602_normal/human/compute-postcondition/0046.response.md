The code `q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. This operation does not affect the values of `graph`, `start`, `used`, `depth`, or `post`. The only change is in the list `q`, which now contains an additional element `w`.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list where `used[w]` is `True`, `q` is a list containing at least two elements including `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is now equal to `w` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`) and otherwise remains unchanged.**
