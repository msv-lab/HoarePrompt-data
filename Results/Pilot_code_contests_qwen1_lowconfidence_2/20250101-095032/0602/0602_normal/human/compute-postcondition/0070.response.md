`used[w]` is set to `True`. The previous state of `used[w]` was `True`, and since it is being reassigned, it now becomes `True`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `used[w]` is `True`, and either `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`, or `depth[v]` remains unchanged.**
