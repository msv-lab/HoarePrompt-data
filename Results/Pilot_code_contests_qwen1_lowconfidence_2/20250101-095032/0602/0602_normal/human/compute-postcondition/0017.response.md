`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so let's denote it as `x`. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `x`, but it is a variable that needs to be converted to a string before writing. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` has written `str(x)`, and `at_start` remains `False`.**
