`used[w]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is set to `w`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v]` must have at least two elements, `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `used[w]` is `True`, and `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, followed by `post[v]` being set to `w`.
