The function `func_2` accepts no parameters. It processes the values of `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and represents the number of rooms, and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and represents the number of passages. Additionally, the function uses variables `a` and `b`, which are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\), representing the rooms connected by each passage. However, the function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes integers `n` and `m` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\)), and integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\)), without returning any value.**
