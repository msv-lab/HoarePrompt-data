The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` performs the following actions:
- It removes the key-value pair from `kwargs` where the key is `'sep'` and assigns the value to `sep`. If the key does not exist in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space `' '`.
- It removes the key-value pair from `kwargs` where the key is `'file'` and assigns the value to `file`. If the key does not exist in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

Therefore, the values of `args` remain unchanged, and `kwargs` loses the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` if they existed, with their respective values assigned to `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers; `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which is either the original value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '`; `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which is either the original value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout`.**
