The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` has the following impacts:

1. It writes the value associated with the key `'end'` in the `kwargs` dictionary to the `file`. If `'end'` does not exist in `kwargs`, it defaults to writing `\n` (newline).
2. It removes the key `'end'` from `kwargs`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers.
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
- `file` contains the concatenated string of `str(N)`, `sep`, `str(M)`, and `at_start` is `False`.

After the code is executed:
- `kwargs` will no longer contain the key `'end'`.
- `file.write()` is called with the default value `\n`, so nothing changes in the content of `file` since it was already set to the concatenated string of `str(N)`, `sep`, `str(M)`.
- `sep` remains unchanged as it was assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` before the removal of `'end'`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep', 'file', and 'end', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` contains the concatenated string of `str(N)`, `sep`, `str(M)`, and `at_start` is `False`.**
