Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers.
   - `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'.
   - `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
   - `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
   - `file` has written `sep` to itself if `at_start` is `False`.
   - `file` has also written `str(x)` to itself.

2. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine what changes occur at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `args`, the first element of `args` (which is `N`) would have been processed in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, the next element in `args` (which is `M`) will be processed in the next iteration.

5. **Modifications Needed:**
   - `args` will now be a tuple with the first element removed (i.e., `M`).
   - `file` will have written both `sep` and `str(M)` to itself, but we don't need to explicitly adjust it since the question only asks about modifying `args`.

Given this analysis, here is the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.**
