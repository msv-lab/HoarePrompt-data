Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list of `True` values for all reachable nodes, `q` is a list containing at least one element, `depth` is a list where each value `depth[v]` is either `depth[w] + 1` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), or remains unchanged, and `post[v]` is updated to `w` if `depth[v]` changes to `depth[w] + 1`, otherwise it remains unchanged; if `used[w]` is `False`, `w` is marked as used, `q` includes `w`, and the depth and post information are updated accordingly.***
