Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `graph`, a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, and a parameter `start`, an integer representing the starting room. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the shortest path from the start room to all other reachable rooms. For each reachable node, it records the last node `w` that was visited in the path leading to node `v`. If the start room is not reachable from any other room, the corresponding entry in the returned list will be -1. The function returns a list where the key is a reachable node and the value is the last node `w` that was visited in the path leading to node `v` for all reachable nodes `v`.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If the graph is empty or the start room is not reachable from any other room, the function still returns a list of length equal to the number of nodes in the graph, filled with -1s for unreachable nodes.
- The function assumes that the graph is a valid adjacency list representation of the cave's rooms. There is no check to ensure that the graph is connected or that the adjacency list is correctly formed.
