The code `post[v] = w` assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. This means that the last node visited in the path leading to node `v` is updated to `w`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list of `True` values for all reachable nodes, `q` is a list containing at least one element (the next node to process), `depth` is a list where each value `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is updated to `w`**
