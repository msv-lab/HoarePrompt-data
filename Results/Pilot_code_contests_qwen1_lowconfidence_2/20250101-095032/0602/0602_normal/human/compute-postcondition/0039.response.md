The code snippet `q.append(w)` appends the value `w` to the list `q`. The value of `w` is not specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a node that is being processed in the context of a graph traversal algorithm (likely a breadth-first search or a similar traversal).

After appending `w` to `q`, the following changes occur:
- The list `q` now includes `w` as its last element.
- The value of `start`, `used`, `depth`, and `post` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list of `True` values for all reachable nodes, `q` is a list containing at least one element plus `w` (the next node to process), `depth` is a list where each value `depth[v]` is either `depth[w] + 1` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), or remains unchanged, and `post[v]` is updated to `w` if `depth[v]` changes to `depth[w] + 1`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `used[w]` is `True`.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list of `True` values for all reachable nodes, `q` is a list containing at least one element plus `w`, `depth` is a list where each value `depth[v]` is either `depth[w] + 1` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), or remains unchanged, and `post[v]` is updated to `w` if `depth[v]` changes to `depth[w] + 1`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `used[w]` is `True`.**
