The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` has written `str(x)`, and `at_start` is `False`.**
