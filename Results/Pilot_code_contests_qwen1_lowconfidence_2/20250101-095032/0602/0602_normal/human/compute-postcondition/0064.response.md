`q.append(w)` adds the value of `w` to the end of the list `q`. No other variables are directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not -1, `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w` if `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, otherwise no changes are made to `depth[v]` and `post[v]`. `used[w]` is `True`, and `w` is appended to `q`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not -1, `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w` if `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, otherwise no changes are made to `depth[v]` and `post[v]`. `used[w]` is `True`, and `q` contains the elements of its original content plus `w`.**
