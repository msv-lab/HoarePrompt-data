Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Structure**: The given for loop is:
   ```python
   for v in q:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This indicates that `v` takes each element from the iterable `q` in sequence.

2. **Identify the Variables and Their States**: There are no explicitly mentioned variables like `v`, `q`, etc., in the initial state. Therefore, we need to infer based on the loop structure alone.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over an iterable `q`, at the end of the previous iteration, `v` would have taken the last value from `q`.
   - We need to ensure that there are more elements left in `q` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the iterable `q` must still contain elements.
   - Therefore, `q` should have at least one more element left after the current iteration.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q` must have at least one more element`**
