`used[w]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the element `w` in the `used` list is marked as used. No other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list where `used[w]` is `True`, `q` is a list containing at least two elements including an unvisited neighbor `w`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is now equal to `w` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), otherwise it remains unchanged.**
