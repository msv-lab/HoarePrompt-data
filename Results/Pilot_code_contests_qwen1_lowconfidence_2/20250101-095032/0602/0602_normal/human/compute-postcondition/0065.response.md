Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not -1. If `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, then `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `depth[v]` and `post[v]`. `used[w]` is `True`, and `q` contains the elements of its original content plus `w` if `used[w]` is `False`.***
