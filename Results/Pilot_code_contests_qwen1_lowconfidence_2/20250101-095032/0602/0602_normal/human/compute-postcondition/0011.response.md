Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), the file now contains the value of `sep` since the condition `not at_start` must be true, leading to the execution of the if part.***
