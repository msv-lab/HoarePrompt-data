Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` contains the concatenated string of `str(N)`, `sep`, `str(M)`, and `at_start` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `args`, which initially contains `N` and `M`.
- For each element `x` in `args`, the loop writes `sep` followed by the string representation of `x` to `file`, except for the first iteration where `at_start` is `True` and no `sep` is written.
- After the loop completes, `args` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify its contents.
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` because they were popped from `kwargs`.
- `sep` retains the value it had when the loop started.
- `file` accumulates the written content, which consists of `str(N)`, `sep`, `str(M)`.
- `at_start` becomes `False` after the first write operation and remains `False` for subsequent iterations.

Since the loop processes both `N` and `M`, the final state of `file` will be the concatenation of `str(N)`, `sep`, and `str(M)`.
