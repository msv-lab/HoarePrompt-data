The code writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The previous state was that `args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` contains the value of `sep`, and `at_start` remains `False`. After executing the code, `sep` is written to `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` has written `sep`, and `at_start` remains `False`.**
