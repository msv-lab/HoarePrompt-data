`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `file` has written `sep` to itself if `at_start` is `False`, and `file` has also written `str(x)` to itself.
