The code updates the value of `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1`. This means that the depth of vertex `v` is set to the depth of vertex `w` plus one. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list where `used[w]` is `True` for the current `w`, `q` is a list containing at least two elements with `w` being one of them, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is updated to `w` if `depth[v]` changes to `depth[w] + 1`.**
