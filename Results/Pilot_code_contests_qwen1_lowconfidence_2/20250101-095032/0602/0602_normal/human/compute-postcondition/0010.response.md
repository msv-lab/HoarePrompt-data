The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The value of `sep` was previously assigned from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, and `file` was assigned from `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`. After executing this line of code, the file will contain the value of `sep`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), the file now contains the value of `sep`**
