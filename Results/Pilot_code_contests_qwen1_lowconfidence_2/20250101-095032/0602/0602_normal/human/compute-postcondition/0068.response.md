The code assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. This means that `post[v]` now holds the value of `w`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `used[w]` is `True`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is `w`**
