`used[w]` is assigned the value `True`. This updates the value of `used[w]` from its previous state, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not -1, `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w` if `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1, otherwise no changes are made to `depth[v]` and `post[v]`. `used[w]` is `True`.**
