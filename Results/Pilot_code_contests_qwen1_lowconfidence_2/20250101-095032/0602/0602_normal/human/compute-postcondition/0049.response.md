The code `depth[v] = depth[w] + 1` updates the value of `depth[v]` to be one more than the current value of `depth[w]`. Given the initial state, this means that the value of `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list where `used[w]` is `True` for some elements, `q` is a list containing at least two elements including an unvisited neighbor `w`, `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is now equal to `w` if `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), otherwise it remains unchanged.**
