Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, `start` is 0, `used` is a list of `True` values for all reachable nodes, `q` is a list containing at least one element (the next node to process), `depth` is a list where each value `depth[v]` represents the shortest distance from `start` to node `v`. `post` is a list where each value `post[v]` represents the last node visited in the path leading to node `v`. The condition `depth[w] != -1` and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`) is satisfied for the current values of `w` and `v`***
