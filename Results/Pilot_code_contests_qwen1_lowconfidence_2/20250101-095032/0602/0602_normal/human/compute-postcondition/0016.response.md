Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing the integer `M`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` has written `sep`, and `at_start` remains `False`. Since the `if` condition is not specified, we consider the `if` part where `at_start` remains `False`, and there is no `else` part to alter this state.***
