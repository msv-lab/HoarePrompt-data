Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\); `m` is the number of times the loop has executed; `graph` is a list of `n` lists, where for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `graph[i]` contains all integers `j` such that there is an edge between node `i+1` and node `j+1` in the graph; `post` is a list starting from the second element of the list returned by `func_1(graph)` and does not contain -1, and it is completely processed. `func_3(i + 1)` has been called for each element in `post`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initially, `a` and `b` are defined as integers within the range \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq n\) with \(a \neq b\). The variable `m` starts at 0 because the loop has not executed yet. `graph` remains as a list of `n` lists, and `post` is a non-empty list starting from the second element of the list returned by `func_1(graph)` and does not contain -1.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in `post`. For each iteration, `func_3(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as an argument. This means that `func_3` is called for every element in `post`.
3. **Final State**: After the loop completes, `m` will be the total number of times the loop has executed, which is equal to the length of `post`. The list `post` is completely processed, meaning there are no elements left in it to iterate over. Therefore, `post` is fully processed, and `func_3(i + 1)` has been called for each element in `post`.

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing.
