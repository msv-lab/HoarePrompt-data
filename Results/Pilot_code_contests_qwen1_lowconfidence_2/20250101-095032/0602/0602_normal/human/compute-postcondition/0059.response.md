The code `depth[v] = depth[w] + 1` updates the value of `depth[v]` to be `depth[w] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `graph[v]` must have at least one element (though this condition does not affect the `depth` variables).
- `depth[w]` is not -1.
- Either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is -1.

Since `depth[w]` is not -1 and `depth[v]` is either greater than or equal to `depth[w]` (because `depth[v]` is -1 or `depth[w] < depth[v]`), updating `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1` will satisfy the condition `depth[v] > depth[w]`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not -1, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`**
