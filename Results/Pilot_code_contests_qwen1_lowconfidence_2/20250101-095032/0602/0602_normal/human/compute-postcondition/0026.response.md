The code `func_3(i + 1)` calls the function `func_3` with the value of `i + 1` as an argument. The value of `i` is taken from the `post` list, which is the list starting from the second element of the list returned by `func_1(graph)`. However, the value of `i` itself is not explicitly given, nor is the exact content of the `post` list. 

Given the precondition:
- `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\).
- `m` is 0.
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists, where for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `graph[i]` contains all integers `j` such that there is an edge between node `i+1` and node `j+1` in the graph.
- `post` is a non-empty list starting from the second element of the list returned by `func_1(graph)`, and it must have at least one element left to process.

After executing the code `func_3(i + 1)`, the value of `i` is taken from the `post` list and passed to `func_3`, but the value of `i` is not updated in the global scope. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it was set to 0 initially. The contents of `graph` and `post` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\); `m` is 0; `graph` is a list of `n` lists, where for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `graph[i]` contains all integers `j` such that there is an edge between node `i+1` and node `j+1` in the graph; `post` is a non-empty list starting from the second element of the list returned by `func_1(graph)`, and it must have at least one element left to process; `func_3(i + 1)` is called with the next element in `post` as an argument.**
