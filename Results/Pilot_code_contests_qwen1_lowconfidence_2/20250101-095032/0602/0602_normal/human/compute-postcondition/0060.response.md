The code assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. This means `post[v]` is now equal to `w`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not -1, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is `w`**
