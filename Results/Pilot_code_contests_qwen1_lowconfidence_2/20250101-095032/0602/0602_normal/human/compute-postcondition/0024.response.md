The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `args` and `kwargs`. `args` is a tuple containing two integers: the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M). `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain parameters for customizing the output, specifically `sep` for separator, `file` for the output stream, `end` for ending character, and `flush` for flushing the output stream. The function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `args` (a tuple of two integers) and `kwargs` (a dictionary), and does not return any value.**
