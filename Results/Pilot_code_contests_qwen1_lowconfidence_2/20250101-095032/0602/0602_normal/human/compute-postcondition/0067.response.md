The code updates the value of `depth[v]` to be `depth[w] + 1`. Given that `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `depth[v]` will be set to `depth[w] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `used[w]` is `True`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`**
