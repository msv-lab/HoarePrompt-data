`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the internal buffer of `file`. The value of `file` remains the same, but the internal buffer is now flushed. The precondition that `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True` is still valid.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing the number of rooms (N) and the number of passages (M) as integers, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep', 'file', and 'end', `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` contains the concatenated string of `str(N)`, `sep`, `str(M)`, and `at_start` is `False`, and the internal buffer of `file` has been flushed.**
