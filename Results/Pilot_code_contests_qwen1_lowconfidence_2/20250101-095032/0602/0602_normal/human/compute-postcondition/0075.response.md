The code `post[v] = w` updates the value of `post[v]` to `w`. The previous values of the variables are:
- `graph[v]` must have at least two elements
- `depth[w]` is not `-1`
- `used[w]` is `True`
- `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`
- `post[v]` is set to `w` (if applicable)

After executing the code, the value of `post[v]` is updated to `w`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least two elements, `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `used[w]` is `True`, `depth[v]` is now `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is `w`**
