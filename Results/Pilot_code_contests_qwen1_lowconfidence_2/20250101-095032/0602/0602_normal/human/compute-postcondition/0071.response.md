The code `q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. This means that `w` is added to the end of the list `q`. 

The initial conditions state that:
- `graph[v]` must have at least one element.
- `depth[w]` is not `-1`.
- `used[w]` is `True`.
- Either `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`, or `depth[v]` remains unchanged.

These conditions remain true after the code execution. The only change is the addition of `w` to the list `q`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must have at least one element, `depth[w]` is not `-1`, `used[w]` is `True`, and either `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`, or `depth[v]` remains unchanged; `q` contains all its previous elements plus `w`.**
