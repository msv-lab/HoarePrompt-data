The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `graph`, a list of lists representing an adjacency list of the cave's rooms, and a parameter `start`, an integer representing the starting room. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the shortest path from the start room to all other reachable rooms. For each reachable node, it records the last node `w` that was visited in the path leading to node `v`. If the start room is not reachable from any other room, the corresponding entry in the returned list will be -1. The function returns a list where the key is a reachable node and the value is the last node `w` that was visited in the path leading to node `v` for all reachable nodes `v`.
