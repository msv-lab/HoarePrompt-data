Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is not equal to `N - 1`. After executing the if-else block:
- If `T[i]` is 'L', then `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`.
- If `T[i]` is 'R', then `AO[0]` is either `AO[0]` (if `AO[0]` is 1) or `AO[0] - 1` (if `AO[0]` is greater than 1).
- If `T[i]` is 'U', then `AO[3]` is the minimum of `H` and `AO[3] + 1`.
- If `T[i]` is 'D', then `AO[2]` is at least 1.
- If `T[i]` is neither 'U' nor 'D', then `T[i]` remains unchanged.***
