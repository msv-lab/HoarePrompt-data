Postcondition: **`AO` is a list where `AO[0]` is the maximum possible left boundary, `AO[1]` is the minimum possible right boundary, `AO[2]` is the minimum possible top boundary, and `AO[3]` is the maximum possible bottom boundary encountered during the loop. `flag` is 1 if the loop breaks due to the condition `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, otherwise `flag` is 0. Additionally, the following conditions hold: `AO[0] > sc` or `AO[1] < sc` or `AO[2] > sr` or (`AO[3] < sr`).**
