The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function likely operates on some internal or external state that includes:

- `H` and `W` are integers such that \(2 \leq H, W \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that \(1 \leq s_r \leq H\) and \(1 \leq s_c \leq W\).
- `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `S` and `T` are strings consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that \(|S| = |T| = N\).

The function returns a value based on the paths described by `S` and `T`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates on `H`, `W`, `s_r`, `s_c`, `N`, `S`, and `T`, and returns a value based on the paths described by `S` and `T`.**
