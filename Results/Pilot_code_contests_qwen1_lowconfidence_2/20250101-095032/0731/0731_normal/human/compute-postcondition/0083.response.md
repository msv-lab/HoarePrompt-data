The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no further operations are specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 2` and is non-negative (so \( i \geq 2 \)), `AO[0]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[1]` is either the minimum of `W` and `AO[1]_prev + 1` or updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[2]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `AO[3]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `T[i-1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'U' or 'D', the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` remains true, `flag` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
