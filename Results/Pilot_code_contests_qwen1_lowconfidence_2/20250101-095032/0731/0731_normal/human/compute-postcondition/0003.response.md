`T` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string. The values of `H`, `W`, `sr`, `sc`, `N`, and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` and `W` are integers such that 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 2 × 10^5, `sr` and `sc` are integers obtained from the input, `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `T` is a string consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that |T| = N, `S` is the input string, `T` is a string read from the user.
