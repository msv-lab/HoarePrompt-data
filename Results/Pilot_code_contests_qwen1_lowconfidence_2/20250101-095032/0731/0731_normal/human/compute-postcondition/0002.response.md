The code `S = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `S`. This means `S` will now hold the input string, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state values for `H`, `W`, `sr`, `sc`, `N`, and `T` are preserved.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 2 × 10^5, `sr` and `sc` are integers obtained from the input, `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `T` is a string consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that |T| = N, `S` is the input string**
