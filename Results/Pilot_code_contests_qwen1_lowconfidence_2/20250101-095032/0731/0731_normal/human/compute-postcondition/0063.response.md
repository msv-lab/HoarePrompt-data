Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 1` (which is not equal to `N - 1`), `AO[0]` is at least 1, `AO[1]` is adjusted based on whether `S[i]` is 'L' or not, `AO[2]` is at least 1, `AO[3]` is adjusted based on whether `S[i]` is 'D' or not, `T[i]` remains unchanged unless `S[i]` is 'R', 'U', or 'D', in which case `T[i]` is updated accordingly, and the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is still true, `flag` is 1. If `S[i]` is 'L', `AO[0]` is updated to `max(1, AO[0] - 1)` and `T[i]` remains unchanged or `AO[0]` is `max(1, AO[0] - 1)`. If `S[i]` is 'R', `AO[0]` is updated to `max(1, AO[0] - 1)`. If `S[i]` is 'U', `AO[2]` is updated to `AO[3] + 2` and `T[i]` is updated to 'U'. If `S[i]` is 'D', `AO[2]` is set to 1.***
