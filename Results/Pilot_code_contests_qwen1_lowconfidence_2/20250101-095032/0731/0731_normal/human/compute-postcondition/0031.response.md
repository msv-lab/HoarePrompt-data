`AO[2]` is incremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `AO[2]` is at least 1, so now `AO[2]` will be at least 2. All other conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be at least 1, and the current value of `i` is not equal to `N - 1`. `AO[0]` is either `AO[0]` (if `AO[0]` is 1) or `AO[0] - 1` (if `AO[0]` is greater than 1). `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`. `AO[2]` is at least 2. `AO[3]` is the minimum of `H` and `AO[3] + 1`. If `T[i]` is 'U' or 'D', then `T[i]` is changed to either 'U' or 'D'. Additionally, `S[i]` is currently equal to 'U'.
