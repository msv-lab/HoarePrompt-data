The code `sr, sc = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the standard input and assigns them to `sr` and `sc`. Since `raw_input()` returns a string, `map(int, raw_input().split())` splits the string into parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns a tuple. This tuple is then unpacked into `sr` and `sc`.

Given the initial state:
- `H` and `W` are integers such that 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ s_r ≤ H and 1 ≤ s_c ≤ W
- `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `S` and `T` are strings consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that |S| = |T| = N

After executing the code:
- `s_r` and `s_c` are replaced by `sr` and `sc`, which are now integers obtained from the input.

The output state is:
Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 2 × 10^5, `s_r` and `s_c` are replaced by `sr` and `sc`, which are integers obtained from the input, `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `S` and `T` are strings consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that |S| = |T| = N**.
