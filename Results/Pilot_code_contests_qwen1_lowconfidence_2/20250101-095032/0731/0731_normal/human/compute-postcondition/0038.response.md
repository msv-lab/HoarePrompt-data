Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 1, and the current value of `i` is not equal to `N - 1`. `AO[0]` is either `AO[0]` (if `AO[0]` is 1) or `AO[0] - 1` (if `AO[0]` is greater than 1). `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`. `AO[2]` is at least 1. `AO[3]` is the minimum of `H` and `AO[3] + 1`. `T[i]` remains unchanged unless `S[i]` is 'R', 'U', or 'D', in which case `T[i]` is updated accordingly.**
