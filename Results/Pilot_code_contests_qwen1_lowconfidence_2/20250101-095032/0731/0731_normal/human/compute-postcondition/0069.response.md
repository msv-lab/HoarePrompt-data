Postcondition: ***`AO[0]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[2]` is max(1, `AO[2] - 1`), `AO[3]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `T[i-1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'U' or 'D', `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is still true, `flag` is 1, `i` is `i - 2` (non-negative, so \( i \geq 2 \)). Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as above when the if condition `T[i] == 'D'` is true.***
