The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints a string to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`AO[0]` is the maximum possible left boundary, `AO[1]` is the minimum possible right boundary, `AO[2]` is the minimum possible top boundary, and `AO[3]` is the maximum possible bottom boundary encountered during the loop; `flag` remains 0.**
