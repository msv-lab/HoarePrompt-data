`AO[0]` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is not equal to `N - 1`, `AO[0]` is `AO[0] + 1`, `T[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is not equal to `N - 1`, `AO[0]` is `AO[0] + 1`, `T[i]` remains unchanged**
