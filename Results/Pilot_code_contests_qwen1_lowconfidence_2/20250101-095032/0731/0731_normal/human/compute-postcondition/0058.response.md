Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 1` (which is not equal to `N - 1`), `AO[0]` is at least 1, `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`, `AO[2]` is at least 1, `AO[3]` is the minimum of `H` and `AO[3] + 1 - 1`, `T[i]` remains unchanged unless `S[i]` is 'R', 'U', or 'D', in which case `T[i]` is updated accordingly, and the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is still true, `flag` is set to 1. If `S[i]` is 'U', `AO[2]` is `AO[3] + 2` and `T[i]` is updated to 'U'. If `S[i]` is 'D', `AO[2]` is set to 1. If `S[i]` is 'R', `AO[0]` is `max(1, AO[0] - 1)`. If `S[i]` is 'L', `T[i]` remains unchanged or `AO[0]` is `max(1, AO[0] - 1)`.***
