To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop starts and iterates. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in reversed(range(N)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the necessary conditions for this loop to execute:

1. **Range Definition**: The `range(N)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to N-1. When reversed, the loop will iterate over these values in reverse order, starting from N-1 down to 0.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, the range `reversed(range(N))` must contain at least one element. This means `N` must be at least 1.

Given the initial states:
- `H` and `W` are integers such that \(2 \leq H, W \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `sr` and `sc` are integers obtained from the input.
- `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `T` is a string consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that \(|T| = N\).
- `S` is the input string.
- `T` is a string read from the user.
- `AO` is a list equal to `[1, W, 1, H]`.
- `flag` is 0.

The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `N` is at least 1, as this is the condition that determines whether the loop body will be executed at least once.

Thus, the state to adjust is:

State: **`N` must be at least 1**.

The other states (`H`, `W`, `sr`, `sc`, `T`, `S`, `AO`, and `flag`) do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute; they might influence the loop's behavior but are not required to ensure the loop starts.
