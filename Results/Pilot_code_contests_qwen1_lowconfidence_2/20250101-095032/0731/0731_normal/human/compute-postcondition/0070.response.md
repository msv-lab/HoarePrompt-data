Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 2`, `AO[0]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[2]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `AO[3]` is either `min(H, AO[3] + 1)` or `max(1, AO[2] - 1)`, depending on the value of `T[i]`, `T[i-1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'U' or 'D', the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is still true, `flag` is 1, and `i` is non-negative (so \( i \geq 2 \)).**
