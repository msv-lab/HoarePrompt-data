Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 1, and the current value of `i` is not equal to `N - 1`. `AO[0]` is either `AO[0]` (if `AO[0]` is 1) or `AO[0] - 1` (if `AO[0]` is greater than 1). `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`. `AO[2]` is at least 1. `AO[3]` is the minimum of `H` and `AO[3] + 1`. If `T[i]` is 'U' or 'D', then `T[i]` is changed to either 'U' or 'D'. Additionally, if `S[i]` is 'U', `S[i]` becomes 'U'. If `S[i]` is 'D', `S[i]` remains 'D'.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that all the conditions and changes described in both the if and else parts are included.
