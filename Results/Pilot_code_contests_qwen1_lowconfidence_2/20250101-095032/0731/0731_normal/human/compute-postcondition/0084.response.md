Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 2` and is non-negative (so \( i \geq 2 \)), `AO[0]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[1]` is either the minimum of `W` and `AO[1]_prev + 1` or updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[2]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `AO[3]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `T[i-1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'U' or 'D', the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` remains true, `flag` is 1, and the most internal loop or conditional block is broken out of.***

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is true or not, the overall state of the program remains consistent with the initial conditions specified in the precondition, with the additional information that the most internal loop or conditional block is exited upon the condition being met or not.
