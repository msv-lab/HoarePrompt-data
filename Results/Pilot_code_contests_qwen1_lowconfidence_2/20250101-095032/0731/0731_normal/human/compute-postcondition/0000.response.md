`H`, `W`, and `N` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `s_r`, `s_c`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` and `W` are integers such that 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 2 × 10^5, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ s_r ≤ H and 1 ≤ s_c ≤ W, `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `S` and `T` are strings consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that |S| = |T| = N; `H`, `W`, and `N` are the input values.
