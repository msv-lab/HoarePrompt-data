Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 2`, `AO[0]` and `AO[1]` are updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[2]` and `AO[3]` are updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `T[i-1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'U' or 'D', the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` remains true, `flag` is 1, and `i` is non-negative (so \( i \geq 2 \)).**
