`AO[1]` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 2` and is non-negative (so \( i \geq 2 \)), `AO[0]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'L' or not, `AO[1]` is now `AO[1]_prev - 1` or the minimum of `W` and `AO[1]_prev + 1` minus 1, `AO[2]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `AO[3]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'D' or not, `T[i-1]` is updated based on whether `S[i-1]` is 'U' or 'D', the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` remains true, `flag` is 1.
