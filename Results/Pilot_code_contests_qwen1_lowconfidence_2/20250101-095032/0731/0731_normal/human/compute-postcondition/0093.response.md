Postcondition: ***`AO[0]` is the maximum possible left boundary, `AO[1]` is the minimum possible right boundary, `AO[2]` is the minimum possible top boundary, and `AO[3]` is the maximum possible bottom boundary encountered during the loop; `flag` is 0 if none of the conditions `AO[0] > sc`, `AO[1] < sc`, `AO[2] > sr`, or `AO[3] < sr` are met. Otherwise, `flag` is 1, and at least one of the conditions `AO[0] <= sc`, `AO[1] >= sc`, `AO[2] <= sr`, or `AO[3] >= sr` is true, and the output is 'NO'.***
