Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 1, the current value of `i` is `i - 1` (which is not equal to `N - 1`), `AO[0]` is either `AO[0]` (if `AO[0]` is 1) or `AO[0] - 1` (if `AO[0]` is greater than 1), `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`, `AO[2]` is at least 1, `AO[3]` is the minimum of `H` and `AO[3] + 1`, `T[i]` remains unchanged unless `S[i]` is 'R', 'U', or 'D', in which case `T[i]` is updated accordingly, and the condition `AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]` is still true, `flag` is set to 1. If `T[i]` equals 'D', then `AO[2]` is set to 1.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts (though the else part does not change the postcondition in this case).
