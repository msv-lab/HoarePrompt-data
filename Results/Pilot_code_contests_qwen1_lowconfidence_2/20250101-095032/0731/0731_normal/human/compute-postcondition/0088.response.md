Postcondition: ***`AO[0]` is the maximum possible left boundary, `AO[1]` is the minimum possible right boundary, `AO[2]` is the minimum possible top boundary, and `AO[3]` is the maximum possible bottom boundary encountered during the loop; `flag` is 1 if `AO[0] > sc`, `AO[1] < sc`, `AO[2] > sr`, or `AO[3] < sr`. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.***
