You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N. Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

* First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
* Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.



Here, to move the piece in the direction of `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.

Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps. Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid. Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

Constraints

* 2 \leq H,W \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq s_r \leq H
* 1 \leq s_c \leq W
* |S|=|T|=N
* S and T consists of the four kinds of letters `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W N
s_r s_c
S
T


Output

If the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

        if S[i] == 'L':
            AO[0] += 1
        elif S[i] == 'R':
            AO[1] -= 1
        elif S[i] == 'U':
            AO[2] += 1
        elif S[i] == 'D':
            AO[3] -= 1
        if AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]:
            flag = 1
            break
    if AO[0] > sc or AO[1] < sc or AO[2] > sr or (AO[3] < sr):
        flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Output hints: The function processes two paths, represented by strings `S` and `T`, which describe movements within a grid of dimensions `H` by `W`. It calculates the boundaries that these paths can reach and checks if a starting point `(s_r, s_c)` is reachable from any point within these boundaries. If the starting point is never outside the calculated boundaries during the paths described by `S` and `T`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Potential edge cases include invalid grid dimensions, invalid starting coordinates, and invalid path descriptions. The function does not handle input validation explicitly for the grid dimensions and coordinates, which could lead to runtime errors if invalid values are provided.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
