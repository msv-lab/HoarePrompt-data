Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Constraints**: The program uses the variables `AO` to represent the constraints on movement, but it updates these values incorrectly. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the simultaneous movements by Takahashi and Aoki in each step. The logic to update `AO` after each step of Takahashi and Aoki is flawed.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Piece Removal**: The program does not correctly check if the piece is removed from the grid after each step. It only checks the final position, but it should also consider the intermediate positions where the piece might be moved out of bounds due to the combined actions of both players.

3. **Improper Use of `raw_input`**: The program uses `raw_input` which is not standard in Python 3. It should use `input` instead.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
2 3 3
2 2
RRL
LUD
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

However, the provided program will incorrectly output `NO`. This happens because the program does not correctly simulate the combined actions of both players in each step and does not properly update the constraints.

A corrected version would involve more complex logic to simulate the game state accurately, considering both players' moves simultaneously in each step and checking if the piece is ever moved out of bounds.
