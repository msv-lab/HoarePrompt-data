You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N. Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

* First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
* Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.



Here, to move the piece in the direction of `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.

Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps. Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid. Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

Constraints

* 2 \leq H,W \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq s_r \leq H
* 1 \leq s_c \leq W
* |S|=|T|=N
* S and T consists of the four kinds of letters `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W N
s_r s_c

T


Output

If the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Constraints**: The program uses the variables `AO` to represent the constraints on movement, but it updates these values incorrectly. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the simultaneous movements by Takahashi and Aoki in each step. The logic to update `AO` after each step of Takahashi and Aoki is flawed.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Piece Removal**: The program does not correctly check if the piece is removed from the grid after each step. It only checks the final position, but it should also consider the intermediate positions where the piece might be moved out of bounds due to the combined actions of both players.

3. **Improper Use of `raw_input`**: The program uses `raw_input` which is not standard in Python 3. It should use `input` instead.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
2 3 3
2 2
RRL
LUD
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

However, the provided program will incorrectly output `NO`. This happens because the program does not correctly simulate the combined actions of both players in each step and does not properly update the constraints.

A corrected version would involve more complex logic to simulate the game state accurately, considering both players' moves simultaneously in each step and checking if the piece is ever moved out of bounds.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two paths, represented by strings `S` and `T`, which describe movements within a grid of dimensions `H` by `W`. It calculates the boundaries that these paths can reach and checks if a starting point `(s_r, s_c)` is reachable from any point within these boundaries. If the starting point is never outside the calculated boundaries during the paths described by `S` and `T`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Potential edge cases include invalid grid dimensions, invalid starting coordinates, and invalid path descriptions. The function does not handle input validation explicitly for the grid dimensions and coordinates, which could lead to runtime errors if invalid values are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
