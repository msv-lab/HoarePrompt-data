Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is a list where each element at index `j` (where `0 <= j < n`) is the smallest value from the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `dp[j]` for all `j < k` where `k` is the index of the insertion. If the loop does not execute (`n` is 0), then `dp` remains a list of `n` elements, each set to infinity.**
