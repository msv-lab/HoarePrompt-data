The `break` statement does not modify any variables but rather exits the current loop or block of code. Since no loop or block is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current loop or block of code if it is inside one. However, since no such context is provided in the initial state or the code itself, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is a list of length `n` with each element set to infinity.**
