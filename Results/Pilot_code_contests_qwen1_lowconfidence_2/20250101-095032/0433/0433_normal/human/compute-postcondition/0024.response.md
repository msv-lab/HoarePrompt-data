The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as indicated in the given function definition `def func():`. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, the function processes an unspecified number of lines of input where each line contains an integer `ai` such that `0 ≤ ai ≤ 109`, and the total number of such lines is `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`.

Given the lack of explicit parameter declaration and the described behavior, we can infer the following:

- The function reads `n` lines of input.
- Each line contains an integer `ai`.
- The function does not return any specific value but presumably performs some operation on the input integers.

Functionality: **The function processes an unspecified number of lines of input, where each line contains an integer `ai` such that `0 ≤ ai ≤ 109`, and the total number of such lines is `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`.**
