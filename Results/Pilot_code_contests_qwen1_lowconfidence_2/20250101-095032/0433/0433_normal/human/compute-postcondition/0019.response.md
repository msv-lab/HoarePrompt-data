Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element is set to infinity.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration End State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 before entering the next iteration. This means at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1`.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `n-1`.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as there is no modification within the loop body that affects `dp`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is a list of length `n` with each element set to infinity.**
