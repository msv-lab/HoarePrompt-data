The code `print(i)` simply prints the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n-1` from the initial state, the value of `i` remains unchanged after executing this line. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is a list of length `n` with each element set to infinity.**
