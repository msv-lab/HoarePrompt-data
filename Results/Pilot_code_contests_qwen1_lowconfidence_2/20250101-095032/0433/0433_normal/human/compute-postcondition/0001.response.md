The code `a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]` creates a list `a` by taking `n` inputs from the user. Each input is converted to a string and added to the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a specific integer value entered by the user within the range 1 to 100000, inclusive, the output state will reflect that `n` inputs have been taken and stored in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value entered by the user within the range 1 to 100000, inclusive; `a` is a list of `n` strings, each string being the input provided by the user.**
