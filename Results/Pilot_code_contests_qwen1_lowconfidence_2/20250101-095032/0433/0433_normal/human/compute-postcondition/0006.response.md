`dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. The bisect_left function finds the index in the sorted list `dp` where `a[i]` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The value of `a[i]` replaces the element at this index in `dp`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `dp` is updated based on `a[i]`

The output state after executing the code snippet is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `dp` is updated such that the element at the index found by `bisect_left(dp, a[i])` is now `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is updated such that the element at the index found by `bisect_left(dp, a[i])` is now `a[i]`**
