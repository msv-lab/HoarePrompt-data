Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `n` with each element set to infinity. If `dp[i]` is infinity, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no additional change in the values of `n`, `i`, or `dp` in the else part since it does not exist.***
