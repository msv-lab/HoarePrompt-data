According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition `n > 0` remains unchanged since `n` itself does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp` is updated based on `a[i]`**
