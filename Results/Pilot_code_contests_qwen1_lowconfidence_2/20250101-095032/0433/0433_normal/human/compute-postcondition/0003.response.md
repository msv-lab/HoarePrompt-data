According to the given for loop statement and the initial states provided:

1. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
2. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 after each iteration until `i` reaches `n`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a specific integer value entered by the user within the range 1 to 100000, inclusive.
- `a` is a list of `n` strings, each string being the input provided by the user.
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements, each element set to infinity.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, if `n` is 0, the loop would not run at all). Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Additionally, at the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be set to 0 since the loop starts iterating from `i = 0`.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

So, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
