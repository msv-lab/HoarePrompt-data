The code `print(i)` simply prints the value of `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged after this print statement. The other variables (`n` and `dp`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `n` with each element set to infinity.**
