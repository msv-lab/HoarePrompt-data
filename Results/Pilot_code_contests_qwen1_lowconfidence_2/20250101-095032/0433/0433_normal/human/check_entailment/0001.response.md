Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The issue lies in how the `dp` array is being used and updated. Specifically, the `dp` array is intended to store the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths, but the current implementation does not correctly update this array to reflect the LIS.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following input:

Input:
```
4
10
22
9
30
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the provided program will produce an incorrect output because it does not properly handle the update of the `dp` array to maintain the correct values for the LIS. The correct approach involves using binary search to find the position to replace in the `dp` array, which the current implementation does not do accurately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import bisect

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    dp = []
    for num in a:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(dp, num)
        if pos == len(dp):
            dp.append(num)
        else:
            dp[pos] = num
    
    print(len(dp))

func()
```

This corrected version uses binary search to find the appropriate position in the `dp` array to either insert a new element or replace an existing one, ensuring that `dp` always contains the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths.
