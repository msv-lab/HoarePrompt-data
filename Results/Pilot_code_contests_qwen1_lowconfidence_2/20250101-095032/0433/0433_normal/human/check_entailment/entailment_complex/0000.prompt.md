You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For a given sequence A = {a0, a1, ... , an-1}, find the length of the longest increasing subsequnece (LIS) in A.

An increasing subsequence of A is defined by a subsequence {ai0, ai1, ... , aik} where 0 ≤ i0 < i1 < ... < ik < n and ai0 < ai1 < ... < aik.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
* 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109

Input


n
a0
a1
:
an-1



In the first line, an integer n is given. In the next n lines, elements of A are given.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and there are n subsequent lines containing integers ai such that 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109.
def func():
    n = input()
    a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]
    dp = [float('inf') for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is a list where each element at index `j` (where `0 <= j < n`) is the smallest value from the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `dp[j]` for all `j < k` where `k` is the index of the insertion. If the loop does not execute (`n` is 0), then `dp` remains a list of `n` elements, each set to infinity.
    for i in xrange(n):
        if dp[i] == float('inf'):
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `n` with each element set to infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input specifying the number of integers `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`), followed by `n` lines of space-separated integers `a_i` (where `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`). It then constructs a list `dp` of length `n`, where each element at index `j` is the smallest value from the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `dp[j]` for all `j < k`, where `k` is the index of the insertion. If no such value can be found (i.e., `dp[j]` remains `float('inf')`), the function prints the index `j` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding any such value, the function prints `n`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
