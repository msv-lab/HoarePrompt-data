Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm. The main issue lies in how the `dp` array is being used. The `dp` array should store the smallest tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths, but the current implementation overwrites the `dp` array incorrectly.

Specifically, the line `dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]` does not update the `dp` array correctly. This line should instead append the value to maintain the properties of the `dp` array as an increasing sequence of tails.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import bisect

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    dp = []
    for i in range(n):
        num = a[i]
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(dp, num)
        if pos == len(dp):
            dp.append(num)
        else:
            dp[pos] = num
    print(len(dp))

func()
```

This corrected code maintains the `dp` array such that it stores the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths, which correctly computes the length of the LIS.
