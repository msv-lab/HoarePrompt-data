Precondition: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, M is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), and the input consists of M lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and c_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 1000, representing the vertices connected by an edge and the distance of the edge, respectively. Additionally, the graph contains neither self-loops nor double edges and is connected.**
