The code `pa = []` initializes an empty list named `pa`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `M`, `ans`, or `p`. Therefore, the only change is that `pa` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `M` is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), `ans` is an empty list, `p` is an empty list, `pa` is an empty list**
