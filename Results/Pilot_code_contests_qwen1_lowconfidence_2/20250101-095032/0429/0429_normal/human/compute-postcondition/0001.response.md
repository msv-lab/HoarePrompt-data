The code initializes an empty list `p`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `M`, or `ans`. The only change is that `p` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `M` is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), `ans` is an empty list, `p` is an empty list**
