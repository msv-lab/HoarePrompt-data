The given code initializes an empty list `ans`. No changes are made to the existing variables `N` and `M`, nor are any new variables assigned values. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the creation of the list `ans`.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, M is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), `ans` is an empty list.**
