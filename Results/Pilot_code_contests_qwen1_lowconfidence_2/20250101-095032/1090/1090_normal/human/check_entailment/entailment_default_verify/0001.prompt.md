You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mahmoud wrote a message s of length n. He wants to send it as a birthday present to his friend Moaz who likes strings. He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string. That's because this magical paper doesn't allow character number i in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than ai. For example, if a1 = 2 he can't write character 'a' on this paper in a string of length 3 or more. String "aa" is allowed while string "aaa" is not.

Mahmoud decided to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be n and they shouldn't overlap. For example, if a1 = 2 and he wants to send string "aaa", he can split it into "a" and "aa" and use 2 magical papers, or into "a", "a" and "a" and use 3 magical papers. He can't split it into "aa" and "aa" because the sum of their lengths is greater than n. He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions.

A substring of string s is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string s, strings "ab", "abc" and "b" are substrings of string "abc", while strings "acb" and "ac" are not. Any string is a substring of itself.

While Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message, Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it. After that Mahmoud asked you three questions: 

  * How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper, the sum of their lengths is n and they don't overlap? Compute the answer modulo 109 + 7. 
  * What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting? 
  * What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in? 



Two ways are considered different, if the sets of split positions differ. For example, splitting "aa|a" and "a|aa" are considered different splittings of message "aaa".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) denoting the length of the message.

The second line contains the message s of length n that consists of lowercase English letters.

The third line contains 26 integers a1, a2, ..., a26 (1 ≤ ax ≤ 103) — the maximum lengths of substring each letter can appear in.

Output

Print three lines.

In the first line print the number of ways to split the message into substrings and fulfill the conditions mentioned in the problem modulo 109 + 7.

In the second line print the length of the longest substring over all the ways.

In the third line print the minimum number of substrings over all the ways.

Examples

Input

3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Output

3
2
2


Input

10
abcdeabcde
5 5 5 5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Output

401
4
3

Note

In the first example the three ways to split the message are: 

  * a|a|b
  * aa|b
  * a|ab



The longest substrings are "aa" and "ab" of length 2.

The minimum number of substrings is 2 in "a|ab" or "aa|b".

Notice that "aab" is not a possible splitting because the letter 'a' appears in a substring of length 3, while a1 = 2.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = input()
    str = raw_input()
    arr = raw_input().split()
    arr = map(eval, arr)
    MOD = 1000000000.0 + 7
    dp = [0] * 3200
    dp[0] = 1
    lastMatch = [0] * 3200
    for i in range(len(lastMatch)):
        lastMatch[i] = i
    maxSubLen = 0
    for i in range(1, len(str) + 1):
        j = 1
        k = arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]
        while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
            maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD
            t = i - j - 1
            lastMatch[t + 1] = max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)
            t = t if t > 0 else 0
            k = min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])
            j += 1
    lastIndex = 0
    lastStrIndex = len(str) - 1
    subNum = 0
    while lastIndex != lastStrIndex:
        subNum += 1
        if lastIndex == lastMatch[lastIndex]:
            lastIndex += 1
        else:
            lastIndex = lastMatch[lastIndex]
    print(dp[len(str)], maxSubLen, subNum, sep='\n')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for updating `lastMatch` and determining the minimum number of substrings is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `maxSubLen`:**
   - The variable `maxSubLen` is intended to track the maximum length of a substring. However, the current implementation only updates `maxSubLen` when a new substring is added to `dp[i]`. This approach is incomplete and does not account for all possible substrings of length up to `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Updating `lastMatch`:**
   - The array `lastMatch` is used to keep track of the last position where each character can end a valid substring. The current logic for updating `lastMatch` is not sufficient to ensure that all valid substrings are considered.

3. **Incorrect Determination of Minimum Number of Substrings:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of substrings is flawed. It uses a simple forward scan without properly accounting for the constraints imposed by `arr`.

To illustrate with an example, consider the following input:
```
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
2
2
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct result. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = int(input())
    str = input()
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    MOD = 1000000000 + 7
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    maxSubLen = 0
    minSubNum = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        for j in range(1, min(arr[ord(str[i-1]) - ord('a')], i) + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD
            maxSubLen = max(maxSubLen, j)
        minSubNum = min(minSubNum, i)

    print(dp[n], maxSubLen, minSubNum, sep='\n')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- `maxSubLen` is updated correctly for all valid substrings.
- `minSubNum` is determined accurately by considering all possible splits.

With these corrections, the program should meet the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `a1, a2, ..., a26`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^3 for each i. After performing several operations, the function calculates the following:

1. It constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` and a `lastMatch` array.
2. It iterates through the string `s` to compute the maximum substring length (`maxSubLen`) using the values from the `arr` list.
3. It then uses the `dp` and `lastMatch` arrays to count the number of substrings (`subNum`) that can be formed based on certain conditions.
4. Finally, it prints the results of `dp[len(str)]`, `maxSubLen`, and `subNum`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes valid inputs for `n`, `s`, and `a1, a2, ..., a26`, but it does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., `n` outside the range 1 to 10^3, `s` not having length `n`, or `a1, a2, ..., a26` not containing 26 valid integers).
- The function does not modify the input parameters; it treats them as read-only.
- The function's overall goal is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to computing some properties of the string `s` based on the given constraints and the values in the `arr` list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
