You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mahmoud wrote a message s of length n. He wants to send it as a birthday present to his friend Moaz who likes strings. He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string. That's because this magical paper doesn't allow character number i in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than ai. For example, if a1 = 2 he can't write character 'a' on this paper in a string of length 3 or more. String "aa" is allowed while string "aaa" is not.

Mahmoud decided to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be n and they shouldn't overlap. For example, if a1 = 2 and he wants to send string "aaa", he can split it into "a" and "aa" and use 2 magical papers, or into "a", "a" and "a" and use 3 magical papers. He can't split it into "aa" and "aa" because the sum of their lengths is greater than n. He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions.

A substring of string s is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string s, strings "ab", "abc" and "b" are substrings of string "abc", while strings "acb" and "ac" are not. Any string is a substring of itself.

While Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message, Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it. After that Mahmoud asked you three questions: 

  * How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper, the sum of their lengths is n and they don't overlap? Compute the answer modulo 109 + 7. 
  * What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting? 
  * What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in? 



Two ways are considered different, if the sets of split positions differ. For example, splitting "aa|a" and "a|aa" are considered different splittings of message "aaa".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) denoting the length of the message.

The second line contains the message s of length n that consists of lowercase English letters.

The third line contains 26 integers a1, a2, ..., a26 (1 ≤ ax ≤ 103) — the maximum lengths of substring each letter can appear in.

Output

Print three lines.

In the first line print the number of ways to split the message into substrings and fulfill the conditions mentioned in the problem modulo 109 + 7.

In the second line print the length of the longest substring over all the ways.

In the third line print the minimum number of substrings over all the ways.

Examples

Input

3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Output

3
2
2


Input

10
abcdeabcde
5 5 5 5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Output

401
4
3

Note

In the first example the three ways to split the message are: 

  * a|a|b
  * aa|b
  * a|ab



The longest substrings are "aa" and "ab" of length 2.

The minimum number of substrings is 2 in "a|ab" or "aa|b".

Notice that "aab" is not a possible splitting because the letter 'a' appears in a substring of length 3, while a1 = 2.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = input()
    str = raw_input()
    arr = raw_input().split()
    arr = map(eval, arr)
    MOD = 1000000000.0 + 7
    dp = [0] * 3200
    dp[0] = 1
    lastMatch = [0] * 3200
    for i in range(len(lastMatch)):
        lastMatch[i] = i
    maxSubLen = 0
    for i in range(1, len(str) + 1):
        j = 1
        k = arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]
        while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
            maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD
            t = i - j - 1
            lastMatch[t + 1] = max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)
            t = t if t > 0 else 0
            k = min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])
            j += 1
    lastIndex = 0
    lastStrIndex = len(str) - 1
    subNum = 0
    while lastIndex != lastStrIndex:
        subNum += 1
        if lastIndex == lastMatch[lastIndex]:
            lastIndex += 1
        else:
            lastIndex = lastMatch[lastIndex]
    print(dp[len(str)], maxSubLen, subNum, sep='\n')


```
Output hints: The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `a1, a2, ..., a26`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^3 for each i. After performing several operations, the function calculates the following:

1. It constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` and a `lastMatch` array.
2. It iterates through the string `s` to compute the maximum substring length (`maxSubLen`) using the values from the `arr` list.
3. It then uses the `dp` and `lastMatch` arrays to count the number of substrings (`subNum`) that can be formed based on certain conditions.
4. Finally, it prints the results of `dp[len(str)]`, `maxSubLen`, and `subNum`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes valid inputs for `n`, `s`, and `a1, a2, ..., a26`, but it does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., `n` outside the range 1 to 10^3, `s` not having length `n`, or `a1, a2, ..., a26` not containing 26 valid integers).
- The function does not modify the input parameters; it treats them as read-only.
- The function's overall goal is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to computing some properties of the string `s` based on the given constraints and the values in the `arr` list.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
