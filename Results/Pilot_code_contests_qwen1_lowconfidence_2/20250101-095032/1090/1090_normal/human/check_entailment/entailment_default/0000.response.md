Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The initialization of `dp` is set to 0 for all indices except `dp[0] = 1`. However, the problem requires counting the number of ways to split the string into valid substrings, which should include the possibility of no splits at all (i.e., the entire string as one substring).

2. **Logic for Counting Substrings**: The logic in the loop to update `dp[i]` and `lastMatch[i]` is incorrect. The current implementation does not properly account for the valid substrings based on the constraints provided by `arr`.

3. **Maximum Substring Length Calculation**: The calculation of `maxSubLen` is based on the assumption that the current character can form a valid substring of length up to `k`. However, this does not fully capture the constraints and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Counting Minimum Number of Substrings**: The calculation of `subNum` is flawed. The current logic does not correctly account for the minimum number of substrings required to satisfy the constraints.

To illustrate these issues, consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
**Input:**
```
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
2
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
3
1
```

The actual output is incorrect because:
- The number of ways to split the string is 3, which is correct.
- The maximum length of a substring is 2, which is correct.
- The minimum number of substrings is 2, but the code incorrectly outputs 1.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
