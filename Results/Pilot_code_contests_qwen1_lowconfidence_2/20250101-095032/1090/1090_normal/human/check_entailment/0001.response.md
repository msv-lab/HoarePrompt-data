Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for updating `lastMatch` and determining the minimum number of substrings is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `maxSubLen`:**
   - The variable `maxSubLen` is intended to track the maximum length of a substring. However, the current implementation only updates `maxSubLen` when a new substring is added to `dp[i]`. This approach is incomplete and does not account for all possible substrings of length up to `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Updating `lastMatch`:**
   - The array `lastMatch` is used to keep track of the last position where each character can end a valid substring. The current logic for updating `lastMatch` is not sufficient to ensure that all valid substrings are considered.

3. **Incorrect Determination of Minimum Number of Substrings:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of substrings is flawed. It uses a simple forward scan without properly accounting for the constraints imposed by `arr`.

To illustrate with an example, consider the following input:
```
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
2
2
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct result. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import print_function

def func():
    n = int(input())
    str = input()
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    MOD = 1000000000 + 7
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    maxSubLen = 0
    minSubNum = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        for j in range(1, min(arr[ord(str[i-1]) - ord('a')], i) + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD
            maxSubLen = max(maxSubLen, j)
        minSubNum = min(minSubNum, i)

    print(dp[n], maxSubLen, minSubNum, sep='\n')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- `maxSubLen` is updated correctly for all valid substrings.
- `minSubNum` is determined accurately by considering all possible splits.

With these corrections, the program should meet the requirements of the problem description.
