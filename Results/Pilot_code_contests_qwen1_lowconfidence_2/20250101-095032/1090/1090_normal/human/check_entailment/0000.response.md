Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of ways to split the string does not accurately reflect the constraints provided by the maximum lengths `a1` to `a26`. Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3
aab
2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output according to the problem description should be:
```
3
2
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
2
3
```

The discrepancy is in the third line of the output, which indicates the minimum number of substrings. The program incorrectly reports that the minimum number of substrings is 3, whereas the correct answer is 2. This happens because the program does not properly account for the fact that some characters may still be able to form valid substrings even if the current substring length exceeds the maximum allowed length for some characters.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the length of the current substring does not exceed the maximum allowed length for the current character. The logic for updating the dynamic programming array `dp` and the minimum number of substrings needs to be adjusted accordingly.
