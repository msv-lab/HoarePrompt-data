Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j <= k and i - j >= 0`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a1` is a list of 26 integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `str` is a non-empty input string.
   - `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list `a1`.
   - `MOD` is 1000000007.0.
   - `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 2` element contains `(dp[len(str) + 1]) % MOD`.
   - `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where `lastMatch[len(str) + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `len(str) + 1`.
   - `i` is equal to `len(str) + 2`.
   - `maxSubLen` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[2]`.
   - `t` is equal to `len(str)`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     - `j <= k`
     - `i - j >= 0`

4. **Current Values**:
   - `i = len(str) + 2`
   - `j = 2`
   - `k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[2]`.

5. **Evaluate Conditions**:
   - Since `i = len(str) + 2` and `j = 2`, `i - j = (len(str) + 2) - 2 = len(str)`, which is always non-negative as `str` is a non-empty string.
   - Therefore, the condition `i - j >= 0` is always satisfied.
   - For `j <= k`, `k` must be at least `j`, i.e., `k >= 2`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need `k` to be at least 2.
   - Since `k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[2]`, `k` must be updated to at least 2.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- Ensure `k` is at least 2.

**State:**
State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list `a1`, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 2` element contains `(dp[len(str) + 1]) % MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where `lastMatch[len(str) + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `len(str) + 1`, `i` is equal to `len(str) + 2`, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is equal to `len(str)`**
