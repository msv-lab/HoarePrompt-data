The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was previously equal to 2, incrementing it by 1 means `j` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `t` is `len(str) - 2`, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index except `lastMatch[t + 1]` is now `t + 2`, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is unchanged, and `lastMatch[len(str)]` is `len(str)`**
