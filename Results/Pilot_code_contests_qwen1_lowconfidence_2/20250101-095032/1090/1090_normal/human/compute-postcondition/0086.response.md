`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. This does not affect `maxSubLen` or `dp[i]`, which are updated according to the previous rules. The output state should reflect these unchanged values.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp_i_initial + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`**
