`subNum` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified. The values of `lastIndex` and `lastStrIndex` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex` and `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1; `subNum` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex` and `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1; `subNum` is increased by 1**
