Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list `a1`, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 1` element contains the final sum of all `dp[i - j]` values calculated during the loop, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is the maximum value it was updated to during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(str) + 2`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution, `j` is `len(str) + 1`, `k` is `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` where `t` is `len(str)` - 1 if `len(str) - 1` is greater than 0, otherwise `t` is 0.**
