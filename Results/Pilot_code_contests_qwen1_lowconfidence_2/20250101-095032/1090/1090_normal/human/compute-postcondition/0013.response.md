The code snippet `lastMatch[i] = i` updates the value of `lastMatch[i]` to be equal to `i`. This means that the `i`-th element of the `lastMatch` list is set to `i`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\), `n` is an input integer, `str` is a new input string from the user, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 1 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is now equal to its index, `i` is less than 3200, `lastMatch[i]` is equal to `i`**
