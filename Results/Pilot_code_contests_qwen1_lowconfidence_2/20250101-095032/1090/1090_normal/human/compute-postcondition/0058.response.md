`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. Given that `i` is the length of `str` + 1 and `j` is 2, the value of `t` is calculated as `(len(str) + 1) - 2 - 1 = len(str) - 2`.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `t` and the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is `len(str) - 2`, `lastMatch[len(str)]` is `len(str)`, and the length of `str` must be at least 2.**
