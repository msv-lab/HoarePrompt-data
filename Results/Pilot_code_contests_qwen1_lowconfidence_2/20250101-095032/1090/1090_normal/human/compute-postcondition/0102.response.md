The code assigns the length of the string `str` minus 1 to the variable `lastStrIndex`. Since the initial state of `lastIndex` is 0 and the value of `str` is not specified, we only know that `lastStrIndex` is now the length of `str` minus 1. The value of `lastIndex` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is 0; `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1**
