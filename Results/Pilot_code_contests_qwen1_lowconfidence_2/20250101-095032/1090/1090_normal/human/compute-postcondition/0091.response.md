To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is:
```python
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. \( j \leq k \)
2. \( i - j \geq 0 \)

Let's look at the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value.
- `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp_i_initial + dp[i - j]) \% MOD\).
- `t` is either `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` or `0` otherwise.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `i - 1`.
- `k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

We need to ensure that both conditions of the loop are met in the next iteration:
1. \( j \leq k \)
2. \( i - j \geq 0 \)

Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure that the updated `j` still satisfies both conditions.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Condition \( j \leq k \)**:
   - In the previous iteration, `k` was updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
   - To ensure \( j \leq k \) in the next iteration, `k` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `j` (which is the previous value of `j` + 1).

2. **Condition \( i - j \geq 0 \)**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that \( i - (j - 1) \geq 0 \), which simplifies to \( i - j + 1 \geq 0 \).
   - This means \( i - j \geq -1 \), which is always true since `i` and `j` are non-negative integers and `i - j` cannot be less than 0 in this context.

Given these points, the only critical condition is ensuring that \( j \leq k \). Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to the new value of `j`.

### Final Adjusted State:

- The state at the end of the previous iteration includes the update to `j` being incremented by 1.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than or equal to the new value of `j`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp_i_initial + dp[i - j]) \% MOD\); `t` is either `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` or `0` otherwise; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `i - 1`; `k` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `j`; `j` is incremented by 1.**

This ensures that the loop condition \( j \leq k \) is satisfied for the next iteration.
