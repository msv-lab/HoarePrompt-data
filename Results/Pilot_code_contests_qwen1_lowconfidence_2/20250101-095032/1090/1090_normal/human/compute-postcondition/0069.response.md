The code snippet updates the value of `k` to be the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`. Let's analyze the impact:

1. `k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`. The value of `k` will now be the smaller of its original value and the value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
2. The other variables (`t`, `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, and `lastMatch[i - j]`) are not affected.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is at least 3.
- `t` is 0 if originally less than or equal to 0, else `t` remains the same.
- `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`.
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `lastMatch[i - j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

After the code execution, the only change is to the value of `k`.

Output State: **`k` is the minimum of its original value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`, `t` is 0 if originally less than or equal to 0, else `t` remains the same, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
