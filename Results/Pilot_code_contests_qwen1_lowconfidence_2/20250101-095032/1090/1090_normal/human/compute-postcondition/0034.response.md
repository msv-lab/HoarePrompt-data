`j` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `i` is at least 3, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`, `t` is 0 if `t` was less than or equal to 0, `t` remains unchanged if `t` was greater than 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to `max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1); k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]), `j` is incremented by 1.
