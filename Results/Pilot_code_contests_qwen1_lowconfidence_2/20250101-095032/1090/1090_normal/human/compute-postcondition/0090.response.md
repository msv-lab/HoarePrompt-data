The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since the initial values of `j`, `dp[i]`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, `maxSubLen`, `dp_i_initial`, `MOD`, and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` are not specified, we only know that `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp_i_initial + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is either `i - j - 1` if `i - j - 1 > 0` or `0` otherwise; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `i - 1`; `k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`; `j` is incremented by 1.**
