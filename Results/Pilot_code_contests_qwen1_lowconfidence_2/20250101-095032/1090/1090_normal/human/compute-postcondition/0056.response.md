The code snippet updates the variable `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Given the initial state, `j` is 2 and `maxSubLen` is 1. Therefore, `maxSubLen` will be updated to 2 since 2 is greater than 1.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is `len(str) - 1`, `lastMatch[len(str)]` is `len(str)`, and the length of `str` must be at least 2.**
