Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `str` is a non-empty input string.
   - `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list.
   - `MOD` is 1000000007.0.
   - `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and all others are 0.
   - `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `str`.
   - `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution.
   - `j` is equal to the length of `str` + 1.
   - `k` is the minimum value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` encountered during the loop execution.
   - `t` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(str)` (inclusive).

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to the length of `str`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `len(str) + 1`.

5. **Other States**:
   - `str`, `arr`, `MOD`, `dp`, `lastMatch`, `maxSubLen`, `j`, `k`, and `t` do not change as they are not directly modified within the loop based on the information provided.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will now be `len(str) + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**`a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\), `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution, `j` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `k` is the minimum value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` encountered during the loop execution, `t` is 0.**
