The code updates `lastMatch[t + 1]` to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to `max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)`.
2. `i` is at least 3, so `i - 1` is at least 2.
3. `maxSubLen` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `j`, but this does not affect `lastMatch[t + 1]`.
4. `t` is defined as `i - j - 1`, which remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only variable affected is `lastMatch[t + 1]`, which is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `i` is at least 3, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`, `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to `max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)`**
