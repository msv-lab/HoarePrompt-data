To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions given in the while loop and the current state of the variables.

### Analysis of the While Loop Condition
The condition for the while loop is:
\[ \text{while } j \leq k \text{ and } i - j \geq 0: \]

This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. \( j \leq k \)
2. \( i - j \geq 0 \)

### Current State After Previous Iteration
- \( \text{dp}[i] \) is updated to \( (\text{dp}[i] + \text{dp}[i - j]) \% \text{MOD} \)
- \( i \) is at least 3
- \( \maxSubLen \) is the maximum of its original value and \( j + 1 \)
- \( t \) is 0 if \( t \) was less than or equal to 0, otherwise \( t \) remains unchanged
- \( \text{lastMatch}[t + 1] \) is updated to \( \max(\text{lastMatch}[t + 1], i - 1) \)
- \( k \) is updated to \( \min(k, \text{arr}[\text{ord}(str[t]) - \text{ord}('a')]) \)
- \( j \) is incremented by 1

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition \( j \leq k \)**:
   - This condition depends on \( j \) and \( k \). For the loop to continue, \( j \) must still be less than or equal to \( k \).

2. **Condition \( i - j \geq 0 \)**:
   - This condition depends on \( i \) and \( j \). For the loop to continue, \( i - j \) must be non-negative.

Given the state after the previous iteration:
- \( j \) has been incremented by 1 (since it was updated inside the loop).
- We need to ensure that both conditions are met for the next iteration.

### Required Adjustments
- Since \( j \) has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that \( j \leq k \) still holds.
- We also need to ensure that \( i - j \geq 0 \) holds.

Since \( i \) is at least 3, we only need to focus on ensuring \( j \leq k \) and \( i - j \geq 0 \).

### Final State Adjustment
To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- \( j \) must be such that \( j \leq k \).
- \( i - j \) must be non-negative.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

### Final Answer
State: **\( \text{dp}[i] \) is updated to \( (\text{dp}[i] + \text{dp}[i - j]) \% \text{MOD} \), \( i \) is at least 3, \( \maxSubLen \) is the maximum of its original value and \( j + 1 \), \( t \) is 0 if \( t \) was less than or equal to 0, otherwise \( t \) remains unchanged, \( \text{lastMatch}[t + 1] \) is updated to \( \max(\text{lastMatch}[t + 1], i - 1) \), \( k \) is updated to \( \min(k, \text{arr}[\text{ord}(str[t]) - \text{ord}('a')]) \), \( j \) is incremented by 1 and \( j \leq k \) and \( i - j \geq 0 \)**
