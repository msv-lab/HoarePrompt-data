To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
```

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`
- `t` is `len(str) - 2`
- `str` is a non-empty input string
- `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list
- `MOD` is `1000000007.0`
- `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0
- `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index except `lastMatch[t + 1]` is now `t + 2`
- `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1
- `maxSubLen` is 2
- `j` is 3
- `k` must be at least 2
- `t` is unchanged (still `len(str) - 2`)
- `lastMatch[len(str)]` is `len(str)`

### Analysis
1. **Condition `j <= k`:**
   - `j` is currently 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 3.
   - Given that `k` is at least 2, this condition is already satisfied as long as `k` is not reduced below 3.

2. **Condition `i - j >= 0`:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1.
   - `j` is 3.
   - This condition becomes `i - 3 >= 0` or `i >= 3`.
   - Since `i` is the length of `str` + 1, and `str` is a non-empty string, `i` is at least 2 (if `str` has length 1).
   - Therefore, `i >= 3` is always true because `i` is the length of `str` + 1, and `str` is non-empty.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, the only condition that needs to be ensured is that `j` remains within the bounds of the loop, which is guaranteed as long as `k` is at least 3.

### State Adjustment
Since the conditions `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0` are both satisfied, no adjustments are needed to the states for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer
State: **`k` must be at least 3, `t` is unchanged (still `len(str) - 2`), and all other states remain as they are.**
