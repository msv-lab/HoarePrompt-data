The given code snippet `maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)` updates the value of `maxSubLen` to be the maximum between `j` and the current value of `maxSubLen`. However, without knowing the initial values of `j` and `maxSubLen`, we cannot specify the exact value of `maxSubLen` after execution. The only thing we can definitively say is that `maxSubLen` will be updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value**
