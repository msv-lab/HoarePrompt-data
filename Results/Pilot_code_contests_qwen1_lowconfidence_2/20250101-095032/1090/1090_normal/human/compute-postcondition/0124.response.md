Functionality: **The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `a1, a2, ..., a26`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and `a1, a2, ..., a26` is a list of 26 integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^3 for each i. After performing several operations, the function calculates the following:

1. It constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` and a `lastMatch` array.
2. It iterates through the string `s` to compute the maximum substring length (`maxSubLen`) using the values from the `arr` list.
3. It then uses the `dp` and `lastMatch` arrays to count the number of substrings (`subNum`) that can be formed based on certain conditions.
4. Finally, it prints the results of `dp[len(str)]`, `maxSubLen`, and `subNum`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes valid inputs for `n`, `s`, and `a1, a2, ..., a26`, but it does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., `n` outside the range 1 to 10^3, `s` not having length `n`, or `a1, a2, ..., a26` not containing 26 valid integers).
- The function does not modify the input parameters; it treats them as read-only.
- The function's overall goal is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to computing some properties of the string `s` based on the given constraints and the values in the `arr` list.**

The function does not return anything explicitly, but rather prints the calculated values.
