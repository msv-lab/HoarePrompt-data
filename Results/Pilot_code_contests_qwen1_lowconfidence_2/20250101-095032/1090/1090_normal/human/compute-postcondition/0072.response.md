According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `len(str) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` is equal to `len(str) + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `len(str) + 2`.

No other state variables depend on the loop itself, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 1` element contains the sum of all `dp[i - j]` values calculated during the loop, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 2, `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution, `j` is equal to `len(str) + 1`, `k` is the minimum value of `k` and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` where `t` is `len(str) - 1`, `t` is `len(str) - 1` if `len(str) - 1` is greater than 0, otherwise `t` is 0**
