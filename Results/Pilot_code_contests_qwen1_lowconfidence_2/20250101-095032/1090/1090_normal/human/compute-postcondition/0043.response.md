Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\), `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution, `j` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `k` is the minimum value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]` encountered during the loop execution, `t` is 0.**
