`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. Given that `i` is equal to `len(str) + 2` and `j` is 1, we can substitute these values into the equation:

`t = (len(str) + 2) - 1 - 1 = len(str)`

Therefore, `t` is now equal to `len(str)`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 2` element contains `(dp[len(str) + 1]) % MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 2, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `t` is equal to `len(str)`**
