The variable `j` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `j` is set directly to `1`, and no other variables are affected. The initial conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\), `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 1 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is at least 1 and no more than the length of `str`, `maxSubLen` is 0, `j` is 1.**
