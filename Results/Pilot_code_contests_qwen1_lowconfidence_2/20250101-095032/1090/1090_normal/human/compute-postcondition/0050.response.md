The code `t = i - j - 1` assigns the value of `i - j - 1` to the variable `t`. Given that `i` is equal to the length of `str` plus one, and `j` is 1, the calculation for `t` is straightforward.

- `i` is equal to `len(str) + 1`.
- `j` is 1.

Therefore, `t` is calculated as follows:
\[ t = (len(str) + 1) - 1 - 1 = len(str) - 1 \]

So, `t` is equal to the length of `str` minus 1. The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is the value of `arr` at the index corresponding to the last character of `str`, `t` is `len(str) - 1`**
