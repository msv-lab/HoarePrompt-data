`j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the initial value (which was 1) to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\), `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is at least 1 and no more than the length of `str`, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 2, `t` is 0, `k` is the minimum of its current value and the value of `arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')]`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is `t`**
