`t` is assigned the value of `t` if `t` is greater than 0, otherwise, it is assigned 0. This means that `t` retains its previous value if `t` was greater than 0, and it becomes 0 if `t` was 0 or less. The other variables (`maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, and `j`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `t` if `t` > 0 else 0; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `k` retains its previous value; `j` retains its previous value.**
