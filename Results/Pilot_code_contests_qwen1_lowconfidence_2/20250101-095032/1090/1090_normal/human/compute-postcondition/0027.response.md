Let's break down the given `while` loop condition and the current state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `str` is a non-empty input string
- `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list
- `MOD` is 1000000007.0
- `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and all others are 0
- `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index
- `i` is at least 1 and no more than the length of `str`
- `maxSubLen` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `t` is 0
- `k` is the minimum of its current value and the value of `arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')]`
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is `t`

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the conditions `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0`.

1. **Condition `j <= k`:**
   - Current value of `j` is 2.
   - `k` is the minimum of its current value and the value of `arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')]`.
     - Since `str` is a non-empty string, `arr[ord(str[0]) - ord('a')]` is a positive integer (as per the constraints).
     - Therefore, `k` is at least 1.
   - Hence, `j = 2` is always less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Condition `i - j >= 0`:**
   - Current value of `i` is at least 1 and no more than the length of `str`.
   - Current value of `j` is 2.
   - For `i - j >= 0`, `i` must be at least 3.

Since the second condition `i - j >= 0` is dependent on the value of `i`, and we know that `i` is currently at least 1, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be at least 3.

State: **`i` is at least 3**
