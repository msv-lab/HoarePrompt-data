Postcondition: **`lastIndex` is a value such that it is incremented by 1 and still less than `lastStrIndex`; `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1; `subNum` is increased by 1. If `lastIndex` equals `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, `lastIndex` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `lastIndex` is updated to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`**.
