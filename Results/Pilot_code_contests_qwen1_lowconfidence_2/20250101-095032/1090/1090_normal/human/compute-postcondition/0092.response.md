The code updates `maxSubLen` to the maximum of `j` and its current value `maxSubLen`. This means `maxSubLen` will take the larger value between `j` and `maxSubLen`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, and `j` retain their previous values.**
