`t` is assigned the value of `i - j - 1`. The values of `i` and `j` are known from the initial state, but their exact values are not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\), `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is at least 1 and no more than the length of `str`, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `t` is `i - 1`, `k` must be at least 1**
