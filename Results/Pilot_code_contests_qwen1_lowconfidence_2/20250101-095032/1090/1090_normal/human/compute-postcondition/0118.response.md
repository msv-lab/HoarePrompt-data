`lastIndex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `lastIndex` was less than `lastStrIndex`, so now `lastIndex` is one more than its previous value, but it is still less than `lastStrIndex`. The value of `lastStrIndex` and `subNum` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is one more than its previous value and still less than `lastStrIndex`; `lastStrIndex` is length of `str` minus 1; `subNum` is increased by 1**
