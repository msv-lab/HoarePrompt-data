The code updates the variable `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `j` and `maxSubLen`, and no value for `j` or `maxSubLen` is given in the code snippet, we cannot determine their exact values. The only thing we know for certain is that `k` must be at least 3 and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is at least 3, `t` is unchanged (still `len(str) - 2`), and `maxSubLen` is updated to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`.**
