The code snippet updates `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of its current value and `j`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the condition `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0` is checked. Since these conditions are true, the value of `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `j`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`, `t` is 0 if `t` was less than or equal to 0, otherwise `t` remains unchanged, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to `max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)`, `k` is updated to `min(k, arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')])`, `j` is incremented by 1 and `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0`**
