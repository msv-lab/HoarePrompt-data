The code snippet `arr = map(eval, arr)` impacts the program by applying the `eval` function to each element in the list `arr`. However, since `arr` was defined as a list of strings obtained from splitting the user input, and `map` returns a map object, the values of `a1`, `n`, and `str` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^3 for each i, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a new input string from the user, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list.**
