`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. The values of `dp[i]`, `i`, `maxSubLen`, and `MOD` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `i` is at least 3, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`; `t` is `i - j - 1`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `i` is at least 3, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`; `t` is `i - j - 1`**
