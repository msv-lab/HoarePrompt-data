The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is equal to 1. After the increment, `j` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `min(k, value)`, `t` is `len(str) - 1`, `lastMatch[len(str)]` is `len(str)`**
