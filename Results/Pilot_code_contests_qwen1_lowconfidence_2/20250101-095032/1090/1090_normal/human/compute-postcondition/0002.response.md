The code `arr = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The previous value of `a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, and `str` is a new input string from the user. After executing the code, the value of `a1` remains unchanged, but the value of `arr` is updated to the list of strings obtained from the user input.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where 1 â‰¤ ai â‰¤ 10^3 for each i, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a new input string from the user, `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the user input.**
