`dp[i]` is assigned the value `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. The value of `i` is at least 3, and `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`. The operation updates the value of `dp[i]` but does not affect the values of `i` or `maxSubLen`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `i` is at least 3, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`.**
