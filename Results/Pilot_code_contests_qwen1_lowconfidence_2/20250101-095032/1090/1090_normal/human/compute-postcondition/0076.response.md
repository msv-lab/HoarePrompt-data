The code snippet updates the variable `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Since `j` is initialized to `1`, and the initial value of `maxSubLen` is not specified but is a result of some previous computation (it's mentioned that `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution), we need to consider the possible values. However, since `j` is `1` and the problem does not specify the exact initial value of `maxSubLen`, we assume the initial value of `maxSubLen` could be less than or equal to `1`.

Given this, `maxSubLen` will be updated to `1` if the initial value of `maxSubLen` was less than `1`, or it will remain the same if the initial value was `1` or greater.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 1` element contains the sum of all `dp[i - j]` values calculated during the loop, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 2, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `t` is `len(str) - 1` if `len(str) - 1` is greater than 0, otherwise `t` is 0**
