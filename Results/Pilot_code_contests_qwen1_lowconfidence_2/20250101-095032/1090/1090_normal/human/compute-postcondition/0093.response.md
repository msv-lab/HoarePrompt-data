The code updates `dp[i]` to the value of `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. This means that `dp[i]` retains its previous value but gets updated to this new value. The other variables (`maxSubLen`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, and `j` retain their previous values.**
