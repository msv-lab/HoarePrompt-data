`t` is assigned the value of `t` if `t` is greater than 0, otherwise it is assigned 0. This means that if `t` was originally less than or equal to 0, it will now be 0. If `t` was originally greater than 0, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is at least 3, `t` is 0 if originally less than or equal to 0, else `t` remains the same, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
