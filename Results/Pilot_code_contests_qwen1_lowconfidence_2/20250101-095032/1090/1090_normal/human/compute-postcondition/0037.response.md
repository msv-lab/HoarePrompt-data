The given code snippet updates `dp[i]` to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. This means that the value of `dp[i]` is incremented by `dp[i - j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`.

Let's list the impacts of the code on the program:

- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `maxSubLen` is not affected by this line of code.
- `t` is not affected by this line of code.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is not affected by this line of code.
- `k` is not affected by this line of code.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is checked to be within the condition `j <= k`.
- `i - j` is checked to be non-negative.

Given these points, the relevant changes are:

- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is checked to be within the condition `j <= k`.
- `i - j` is checked to be non-negative.

Since the initial state includes the conditions `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0`, these conditions remain valid post-execution.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is checked to be within the condition `j <= k`, `i - j` is checked to be non-negative**
