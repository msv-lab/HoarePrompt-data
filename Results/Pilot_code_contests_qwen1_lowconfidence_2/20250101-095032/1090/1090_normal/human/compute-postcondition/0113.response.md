`lastIndex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`, and `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1. The value of `subNum` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is `lastIndex + 1`, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, `subNum` is increased by 1**
