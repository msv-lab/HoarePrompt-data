The code updates the value of `lastMatch[t + 1]` to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`. Given that `t` is `len(str) - 1`, and `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, we can substitute these values into the equation.

Since `i` is `len(str) + 1`, then `i - 1` is `len(str)`. The current value of `lastMatch[t + 1]` (which is `lastMatch[len(str)]`) is equal to its index, which is `len(str)`.

Therefore, the maximum between `lastMatch[len(str)]` and `len(str)` is `len(str)`, because both are equal.

So, `lastMatch[len(str)]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `len(str)`.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `arr` at the index corresponding to the last character of `str`, `t` is `len(str) - 1`, `lastMatch[len(str)]` is `len(str)`**
