According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `lastIndex` and `lastStrIndex`. The loop condition `lastIndex != lastStrIndex` must be true for the loop to execute. 

Right before the loop:
- `lastIndex` is 0
- `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1

For the loop to execute, `lastIndex` should not be equal to `lastStrIndex`. Since `lastIndex` is currently 0 and `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, we need to ensure that `lastIndex` is different from `lastStrIndex`.

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `lastIndex` to be something other than `lastStrIndex`.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, `subNum` is 0**
