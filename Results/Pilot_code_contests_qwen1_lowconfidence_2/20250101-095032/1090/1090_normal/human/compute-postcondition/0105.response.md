`subNum` is incremented by 1. The value of `lastIndex` remains not equal to `lastStrIndex`, and `lastStrIndex` remains equal to the length of `str` minus 1. Therefore, the output state is: `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, `subNum` is 1.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, `subNum` is 1**
