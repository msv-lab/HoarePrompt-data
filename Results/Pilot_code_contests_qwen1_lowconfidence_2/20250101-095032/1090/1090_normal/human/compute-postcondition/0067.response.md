The code updates `lastMatch[t + 1]` to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`. The value of `t` is defined as `i - j - 1`, so `t + 1` is `i - j`. Therefore, `lastMatch[i - j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is at least 3, `t` is `i - j - 1`, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `lastMatch[i - j]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.**
