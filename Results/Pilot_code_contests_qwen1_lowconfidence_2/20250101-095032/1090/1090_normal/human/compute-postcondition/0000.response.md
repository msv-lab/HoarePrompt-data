The code reads an input value for `n` and converts it to an integer. This overwrites the previous value of `n`, which was an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). The other variables (`s` and the list `a1, a2, ..., a26`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, `a1` is a list of 26 integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^3 for each i, `n` is an input integer**
