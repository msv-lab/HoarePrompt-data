Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`.
   - `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1.
   - `subNum` is 1.
   - If `lastIndex` equals `lastMatch[lastIndex] + 1`, then `lastIndex` is set to `lastMatch[lastIndex] + 1`. Otherwise, `lastIndex` remains unchanged at `lastMatch[lastIndex]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop continues as long as `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`.

3. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition is `lastIndex != lastStrIndex`, the only way the loop can continue is if `lastIndex` is still not equal to `lastStrIndex` after executing the loop body.
   - If `lastIndex` were to become equal to `lastStrIndex` during the loop execution, the loop would terminate.

4. **Key Variables**:
   - `lastIndex` and `lastStrIndex` are the critical variables here.
   - `lastStrIndex` is fixed as the length of `str` minus 1, so it cannot change.
   - Therefore, `lastIndex` must remain different from `lastStrIndex` for the loop to continue.

5. **Loop Body Execution**:
   - If `lastIndex` equals `lastMatch[lastIndex] + 1`, then `lastIndex` is updated to `lastMatch[lastIndex] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `lastIndex` remains unchanged at `lastMatch[lastIndex]`.

6. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to continue, `lastIndex` must not equal `lastStrIndex` after the loop body executes.
   - This means we need to ensure that `lastIndex` is still not equal to `lastStrIndex` after the possible update.

7. **Final State**:
   - Given that `lastStrIndex` is fixed, the only thing that can change is `lastIndex`.
   - We need to ensure that `lastIndex` remains different from `lastStrIndex`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex` and `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1**.
