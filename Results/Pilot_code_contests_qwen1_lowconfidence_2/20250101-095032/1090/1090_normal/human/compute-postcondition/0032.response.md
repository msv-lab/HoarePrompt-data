`t` is assigned the value of `t` if `t` is greater than 0, otherwise it is assigned the value 0. This does not change the value of `t` if `t` is already greater than 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `i` is at least 3, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`, `t` is 0 if `t` was less than or equal to 0, `t` remains unchanged if `t` was greater than 0, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to `max(lastMatch[t + 1], i - 1)`**
