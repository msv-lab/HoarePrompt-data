The code updates the variable `maxSubLen` to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`. Since `j` is initially 1 and `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution, which is not specified but assumed to be less than `j` before this line of code (as `j` starts from 1 and increases), `maxSubLen` will be updated to 1 because `j` is 1 and is now the new maximum.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is a list of 26 integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\) for each \(i\), `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and all others are 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is the value of `arr` at the index corresponding to the last character of `str`, `t` is 0.
