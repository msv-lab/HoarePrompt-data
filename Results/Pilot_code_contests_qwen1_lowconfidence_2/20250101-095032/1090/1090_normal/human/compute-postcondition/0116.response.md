Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current States:**
   - `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`
   - `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1
   - `subNum` is increased by 1
   - If `lastIndex` equals `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, then `lastIndex` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `lastIndex` is updated to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastStrIndex`.

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition:**
   - Given that `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, it means `lastStrIndex` is the highest index possible in the string `str`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `lastIndex` must be less than `lastStrIndex`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since `lastStrIndex` is fixed (length of `str` minus 1), the only way for the loop to continue is if `lastIndex` is less than this value.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `lastIndex` is incremented such that it becomes less than `lastStrIndex`.

5. **Conditions inside the Loop:**
   - If `lastIndex` equals `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, `lastIndex` is incremented by 1.
   - If `lastIndex` does not equal `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, `lastIndex` is updated to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`.

6. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - To ensure the loop executes again, we need `lastIndex` to be incremented by 1, making it less than `lastStrIndex`.
   - This requires that `lastIndex` was previously equal to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`.

7. **Final State:**
   - We need to ensure that `lastIndex` is set to a value such that it is incremented by 1 and still less than `lastStrIndex`.

Given the above analysis, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

- Ensure `lastIndex` is set to a value such that it is incremented by 1 and still less than `lastStrIndex`.
- `lastStrIndex` remains the same (length of `str` minus 1).
- `subNum` remains increased by 1.

Thus, the final state should be:

State: **`lastIndex` is set to a value such that it is incremented by 1 and still less than `lastStrIndex`, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, and `subNum` is increased by 1**.
