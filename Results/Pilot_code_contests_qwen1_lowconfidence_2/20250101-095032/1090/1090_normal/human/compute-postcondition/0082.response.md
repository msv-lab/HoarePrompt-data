The value of `j` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `j` is `2`.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list `a1`, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 2` element contains `(dp[len(str) + 1]) % MOD`, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where `lastMatch[len(str) + 1]` is the maximum of its current value and `len(str) + 1`, `i` is equal to `len(str) + 2`, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is the minimum of its current value and `arr[2]`, `t` is equal to `len(str)`**
