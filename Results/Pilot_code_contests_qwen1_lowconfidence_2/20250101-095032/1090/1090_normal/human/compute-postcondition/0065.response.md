The code updates `dp[i]` to be `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`. However, without knowing the exact values of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - j]`, and `MOD`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[i]`. We can only say that `dp[i]` is updated to this value.

Given the precondition, the other variables remain unchanged: `k` is at least 3, `t` is unchanged, and `maxSubLen` is updated to be the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`.

Output State: **`k` is at least 3, `t` is unchanged, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of `j` and `maxSubLen`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.**
