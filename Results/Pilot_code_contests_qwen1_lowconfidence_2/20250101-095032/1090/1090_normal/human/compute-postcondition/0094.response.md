`t` is assigned the value `i - j - 1`. The values of `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, and `j` retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t`, `lastMatch[t + 1]`, `k`, and `j` retain their previous values; `t` is `i - j - 1`.**
