`lastIndex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `lastIndex` is `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, and `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1. The value of `subNum` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is equal to `lastMatch[lastIndex]` + 1, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, `subNum` is 1**
