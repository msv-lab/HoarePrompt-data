The code `str = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `str`. This changes the value of `str` from being a string of length `n` to the new input string provided by the user. The other variables (`a1` and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^3 for each i, `n` is an input integer, `str` is the new input string from the user**
