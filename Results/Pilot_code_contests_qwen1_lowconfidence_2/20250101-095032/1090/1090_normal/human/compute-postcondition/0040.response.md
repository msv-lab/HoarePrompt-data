`t` is reassigned the value of `t` if `t` is greater than 0, otherwise, it is set to 0. This does not change the value of `t` if it was already greater than 0, and sets `t` to 0 if it was less than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is checked to be within the condition `j <= k`, `i - j` is checked to be non-negative, `t` is `i - j - 1`, `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `i - 1`, `t` is `t` if `t` > 0 else 0**
