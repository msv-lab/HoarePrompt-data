The code assigns the value of `lastMatch[lastIndex]` to `lastIndex`. Since `lastMatch` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value that `lastIndex` will take. However, we know that `lastIndex` was initially not equal to `lastStrIndex` and `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1. After executing the code, `lastIndex` will be updated to the value of `lastMatch[lastIndex]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is updated to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1; `subNum` is increased by 1**
