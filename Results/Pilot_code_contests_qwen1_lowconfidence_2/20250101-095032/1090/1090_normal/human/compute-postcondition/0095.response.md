The code updates `lastMatch[t + 1]` to the maximum of `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `i - 1`. This means that `lastMatch[t + 1]` will take on the larger value between its current value and `i - 1`. The other variables (`maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `t`, `k`, and `j`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` retains its previous value; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `k` retains its previous value; `j` retains its previous value.**
