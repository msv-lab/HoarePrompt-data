The code updates the value of `k` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Given the impact on `k`, the output state will be:

- `maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value.
- `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`.
- `t` is `t` if `t` > 0 else 0.
- `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`.
- `k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`.
- `j` retains its previous value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i] + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `t` if `t` > 0 else 0; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`; `k` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `arr[ord(str[t]) - ord('a')]`; `j` retains its previous value.**
