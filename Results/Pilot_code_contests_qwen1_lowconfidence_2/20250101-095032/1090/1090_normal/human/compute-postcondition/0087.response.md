The code updates `lastMatch[t + 1]` to be the maximum of `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `i - 1`. The values of `maxSubLen`, `dp[i]`, `t`, `lastMatch`, and other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. The only change is to `lastMatch[t + 1]`.

Output State: **`maxSubLen` is updated to the maximum of `j` and its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp_i_initial + dp[i - j]) % MOD`; `t` is `i - j - 1`; `lastMatch[t + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `lastMatch[t + 1]` and `i - 1`**
