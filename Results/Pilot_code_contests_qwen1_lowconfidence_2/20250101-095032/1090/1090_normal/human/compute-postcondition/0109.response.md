`lastIndex` is reassigned the value of `lastMatch[lastIndex]`. Given the initial condition that `lastIndex` is not equal to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, this assignment will change the value of `lastIndex` to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lastIndex` is equal to `lastMatch[lastIndex]`, `lastStrIndex` is the length of `str` minus 1, and `subNum` is 1**
