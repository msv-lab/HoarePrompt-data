Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
```

Given the current state:
- `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is `min(k, value)`.

We need to ensure that both conditions `j <= k` and `i - j >= 0` are satisfied for the loop to execute one more time.

1. **Condition `j <= k`:**
   - Currently, `j` is 2.
   - We need `k` to be greater than or equal to 2 for this condition to hold true.

2. **Condition `i - j >= 0`:**
   - Currently, `i` is the length of `str` + 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - Therefore, `i - j = (length of str + 1) - 2 = length of str - 1`.
   - For `i - j >= 0`, `length of str` must be at least 2.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure:
- `k` is at least 2.
- The length of `str` is at least 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 2.
- The length of `str` must be at least 2.

State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len_str + 1` element is 0, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 1, `maxSubLen` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is `len(str) - 1`, `lastMatch[len(str)]` is `len(str)` and the length of `str` must be at least 2.**
