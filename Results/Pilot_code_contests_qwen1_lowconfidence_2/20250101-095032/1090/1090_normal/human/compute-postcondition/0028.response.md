The code `maxSubLen = max(j, maxSubLen)` updates the value of `maxSubLen` to be the maximum between `j` and `maxSubLen`. However, the initial value of `maxSubLen` is not specified in the initial state, and `j` is also not defined. Given the initial state only mentions that `i` is at least 3, the variables `j` and `maxSubLen` remain undefined or unspecified in the initial state.

Since no concrete values are given for `j` and `maxSubLen`, the only thing we can definitively say is that `maxSubLen` has been updated to be the maximum of its current value and `j`.

Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `maxSubLen` is the maximum of its original value and `j`**
