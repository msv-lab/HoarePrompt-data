Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial program state step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one more time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while j <= k and i - j >= 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

We need to ensure that the condition `j <= k and i - j >= 0` evaluates to `True` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial program state:
- `a1` is a list of 26 integers
- `n` is an input integer
- `str` is a non-empty input string
- `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list
- `MOD` is 1000000007.0
- `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 1` element contains the sum of all `dp[i - j]` values calculated during the loop
- `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index
- `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 2
- `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution
- `j` is `1`
- `k` is `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`
- `t` is `len(str) - 1` if `len(str) - 1` is greater than 0, otherwise `t` is 0

Let's check the conditions:

1. `j <= k`:
   - Initially, `j` is set to `1`.
   - `k` is `arr[ord(str[i - 1]) - ord('a')]`.
   - For `j <= k` to be true, `k` must be at least `1`.

2. `i - j >= 0`:
   - Initially, `i` is set to `len(str) + 2`.
   - `j` is `1`.
   - For `i - j >= 0` to be true, `len(str) + 2 - 1` (which simplifies to `len(str) + 1`) must be non-negative. This condition is always true since `len(str)` is a non-negative integer and adding `1` ensures the result is positive.

Since the second condition `i - j >= 0` is always true, we only need to focus on the first condition `j <= k`.

For `j <= k` to be true, `k` must be at least `1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `k` must be at least `1`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`a1` is a list of 26 integers, `n` is an input integer, `str` is a non-empty input string, `arr` is a map object where each element is the evaluated version of the corresponding string in the original list, `MOD` is 1000000007.0, `dp` is a list of 3200 elements where the first element is 0 and the `len(str) + 1` element contains the sum of all `dp[i - j]` values calculated during the loop, `lastMatch` is a list of 3200 elements where each element is equal to its index, `i` is equal to the length of `str` + 2, `maxSubLen` is the maximum substring length found during the loop execution, `j` is `1`, `k` is at least `1`, `t` is `len(str) - 1` if `len(str) - 1` is greater than 0, otherwise `t` is 0**
