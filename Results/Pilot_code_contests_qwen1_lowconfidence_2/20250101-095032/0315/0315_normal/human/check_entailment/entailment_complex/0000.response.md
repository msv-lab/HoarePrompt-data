Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly identify dominant piranhas in all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not check if a piranha can eat all other piranhas in the aquarium. The code only checks if a piranha can eat one of its neighbors and assumes that this piranha is dominant if it can eat one neighbor. However, according to the problem description, a dominant piranha must be able to eat all other piranhas in the aquarium.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

### Example:
Input:
```
3
5
5 3 4 4 5
3
1 1 1
5
4 4 3 4 4
```

### Expected Output:
```
3
-1
4
```

### Actual Output with Provided Code:
```
3
-1
4
```

The provided code correctly identifies the third piranha as dominant in the first and third cases. However, in the second case, where all piranhas have the same size (1), no piranha can be dominant because none can eat another piranha. The provided code incorrectly returns -1, indicating there are no dominant piranhas, which is correct in this case.

However, the issue arises in cases where a piranha can theoretically eat all others but the code logic does not fully implement this requirement. For instance, consider a scenario where a large piranha can sequentially eat smaller ones but the final result does not meet the full criteria of being dominant as defined in the problem.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the failure:
```
5
5 4 3 2 1
```

In this case, the first piranha can theoretically eat all others, but the provided code does not fully implement the logic to ensure this.

Therefore, the provided code does not fully meet the problem description requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
