Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if there is a dominant piranha. The function `func_2` simply constructs a string representation of the arguments passed to it and writes it to a stream, without performing any operations related to finding a dominant piranha. The main function `func_1` calls `func_2` instead of a function that actually simulates the growth process and checks for dominance. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and the output hints confirm that the program does not perform any meaningful operations related to the problem.
