You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n piranhas with sizes a_1, a_2, …, a_n in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.

Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is dominant piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called dominant if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the dominant piranha will eat them.

Because the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely: 

  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i-1 if the piranha i-1 exists and a_{i - 1} < a_i. 
  * The piranha i can eat the piranha i+1 if the piranha i+1 exists and a_{i + 1} < a_i. 



When the piranha i eats some piranha, its size increases by one (a_i becomes a_i + 1).

Your task is to find any dominant piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.

Note that you have to find any (exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.

For example, if a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5], then the third piranha can be dominant. Consider the sequence of its moves: 

  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{5}, 4, 5] (the underlined piranha is our candidate). 
  * The piranha eats the third piranha and a becomes [5, \underline{6}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the first piranha and a becomes [\underline{7}, 5]. 
  * The piranha eats the second piranha and a becomes [\underline{8}]. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of piranhas in the aquarium. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the size of the i-th piranha.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: -1 if there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium or index of any dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several answers, you can print any.

Example

Input


6
5
5 3 4 4 5
3
1 1 1
5
4 4 3 4 4
5
5 5 4 3 2
3
1 1 2
5
5 4 3 5 5


Output


3
-1
4
3
3
1

Note

The first test case of the example is described in the problem statement.

In the second test case of the example, there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium.

In the third test case of the example, the fourth piranha can firstly eat the piranha to the left and the aquarium becomes [4, 4, 5, 4], then it can eat any other piranha in the aquarium.

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
