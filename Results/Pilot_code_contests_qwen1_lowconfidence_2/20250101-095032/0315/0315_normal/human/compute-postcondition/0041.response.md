Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` equals `m`, and after the execution of the if-else block, if `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, or if `i + 1` is less than `n` and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i + 1]`, `f` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If neither condition is met, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.***
