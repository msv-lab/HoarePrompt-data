Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer. If `a[i]` equals the maximum value `m` in list `a`, then the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `a[i] > a[i + 1]` is met, and `i` is incremented by 1 if `i < n-1`. If not, `i` remains the same. `n` is greater than 0; `t` is decremented by 1; `f` is 1; `a` is a list of integers; `m` is the maximum value in `a`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
