According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. The loop body is omitted, but we know that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1`.

Since the loop is controlled by the variable `t`, and it is mentioned that `t` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Decrement `t`:** Since the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 will reduce the count of iterations.
2. **Check `t`:** After decrementing `t`, `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `t` is now `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `f`, `i`, and `func_2`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1), `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1**.
