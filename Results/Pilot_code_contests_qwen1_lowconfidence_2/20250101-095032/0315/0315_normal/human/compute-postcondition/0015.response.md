The code `file.write(sep)` does not assign any new values to the variables `at_start`, `args`, or `x`. It writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. The variables `at_start`, `args`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` must have at least two more elements, `x` is the next element in the args list**
