`m` is assigned the value of the maximum element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers read from input, the value of `m` will be the largest integer in that list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `m` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `m` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1**
