The code `at_start = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `at_start`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `kwargs`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers, `kwargs` is an empty dictionary, and `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers, `kwargs` is an empty dictionary, and `at_start` is `True`.**
