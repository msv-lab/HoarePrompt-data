The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as its argument. However, the code snippet does not provide any information about what happens inside the `func_2` function or how it affects the variables. The variables `n`, `a[i]`, `m`, `a[i - 1]`, and `a[i + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states because no assignment or modification is made to these variables within the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` equals `m`, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` if `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, or `a[i]` is greater than `a[i + 1]` if `i + 1` is less than `n`.**
