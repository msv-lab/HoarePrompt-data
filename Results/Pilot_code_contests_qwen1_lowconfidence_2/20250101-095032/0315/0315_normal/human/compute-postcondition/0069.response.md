The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but rather exits the current loop or conditional block. Given the initial state and the fact that the condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` is no longer applicable for the next call, it implies that the loop or conditional block has ended.

Output State: **`i` is now `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `f` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the maximum value in `a`.**
