The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it implies that the function will process input through some external means (e.g., via command-line arguments, user input, or predefined variables). For each test case, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of piranhas in the aquarium, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers representing the sizes of the piranhas. The function does not explicitly return anything in the given information, but it processes the test cases and piranha sizes.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input for `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts `n` as the number of piranhas and `a` as a list of sizes of the piranhas.**
