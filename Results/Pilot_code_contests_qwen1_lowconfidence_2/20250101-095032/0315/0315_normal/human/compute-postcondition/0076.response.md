Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 if `i < n-1` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]` is true, otherwise `i` remains the same. `n` is greater than 0; `t` is `t - 1`; `f` is 1; `a` is a list of integers; `m` is the maximum value in `a`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
