Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input
   - `m` is the maximum value in the new list `a`
   - `f` is 0
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `func_2` has been called with argument `-1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.

3. **Key Variables:**
   - The loop variable `i` is initialized to `n-1`.
   - The loop will iterate over `range(n)`, which means it will run from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` will generate values from `0` to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0 or less, the range will be empty.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is already set to `n-1`, it will enter the loop if `n > 0`.
   - Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
