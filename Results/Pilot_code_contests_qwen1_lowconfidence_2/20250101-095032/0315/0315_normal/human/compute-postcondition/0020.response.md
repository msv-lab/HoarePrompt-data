`kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` returns the value of the key 'end' from the dictionary `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise it returns the default value `\n`. The returned value is written to the file using `file.write()`. Since `kwargs` was not specified, we assume it does not contain the key 'end', so `'\n'` is written to the file. The variables `at_start` and `args` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is an empty list or has no elements left to iterate over, and the file has been written with `'\n'`.**
