Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is an index in the list `a`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `f` is either 1 or 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
   - `m` is the maximum value in `a`.
   - If `a[i]` equals `m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is either incremented by 1 (if certain conditions are met) or remains the same (if conditions are not met).

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the current index.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `f` is either 1 or 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `m` is the maximum value in `a`.
   - If `a[i]` equals `m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.

5. **Determine Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - If `i < n-1`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - If `i == n-1`, the loop will terminate as `i` cannot be incremented further.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - If `i < n-1`, increment `i` by 1.
   - Ensure `f` remains the same unless the conditions for incrementing `i` are met.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- If `i < n-1`, then `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `f` remains the same unless the conditions for incrementing `i` are met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value (if it was less than `n-1`), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `f` is either 1 or 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`.** 

If `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate. 

So, the specific state can be summarized as:
State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i < n-1`, otherwise `i` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `f` is either 1 or 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`.**
