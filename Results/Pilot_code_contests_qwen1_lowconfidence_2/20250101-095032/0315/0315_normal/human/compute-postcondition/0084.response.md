Output State: **`i` is the last index processed by the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is `t - i`, `f` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the maximum value in `a`. If no index `i` satisfies the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`, then `i` remains 0; otherwise, `i` is incremented appropriately based on the conditions.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each index `i`, it checks if `a[i]` equals the maximum value `m` in the list `a`. If true, it further checks whether `a[i]` is greater than its neighbors (`a[i-1]` or `a[i+1]`). If any of these conditions are met, `func_2(i + 1)` is called, `f` is set to 1, and the loop breaks.
3. **Final State**:
   - **`i`**: The final value of `i` will be the last index that satisfied the conditions within the loop. If no such index exists, `i` will remain 0.
   - **`n`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
   - **`t`**: Decrements by the number of times the loop was executed (which is `i`).
   - **`f`**: Set to 1 if any index satisfied the conditions, otherwise remains 0.
   - **`a`**: The list of integers remains unchanged unless `func_2(i + 1)` modifies it (not specified in the code).
   - **`m`**: The maximum value in the list `a` remains unchanged.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., no index `i` satisfies the conditions), then `i` remains 0, `f` remains 0, and `t` is decremented by 0.
