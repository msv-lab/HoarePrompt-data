The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, which means `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `f` also remains unchanged from its previous state. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `f` is unchanged from the previous state.**
