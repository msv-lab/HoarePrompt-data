Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is `n`. If `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and the element at index `i` in array `a` is greater than the element at index `i - 1`, or if `i + 1` is less than `n` and the element at index `i` in array `a` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then `f` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no change is made to `f` and `i` remains `n`.***
