The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block of code. In this case, since there is no loop or nested block of code that `break` is exiting from, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions about the values of `a[i]` relative to its neighbors and the value of `f` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` equals `m`, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` if `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, or `a[i]` is greater than `a[i + 1]` if `i + 1` is less than `n`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
