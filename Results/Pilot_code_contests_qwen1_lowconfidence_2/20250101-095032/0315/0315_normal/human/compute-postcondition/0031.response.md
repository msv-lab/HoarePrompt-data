The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1**
