`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the value of `sep` is not specified in the initial state, and the code does not change its value. The variables `at_start` and `args` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` must have at least one more element**
