The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, which means `i` will be incremented by 1 if `i < n-1`. Since the exact value of `i` and `n` is not specified, we know that `i` will become `i + 1` if the condition `i < n-1` is true, otherwise, `i` will remain the same. The other variables (`t`, `f`, `a`, and `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i < n-1` and the new value is `i + 1`, otherwise `i` remains the same; `n` is greater than 0; `t` is `t - 1`; `f` is either 1 or 0; `a` is a list of integers; `m` is the maximum value in `a`.**
