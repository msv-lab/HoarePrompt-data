The function `func_2(-1)` is called, but the content of `func_2` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Since there is no information about what `func_2` does, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. Therefore, we can only state that the call to `func_2(-1)` has taken place and the value of `i` has not been modified by this call (since no assignment to `i` is shown within `func_2`).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `func_2` has been called with argument `-1`.**
