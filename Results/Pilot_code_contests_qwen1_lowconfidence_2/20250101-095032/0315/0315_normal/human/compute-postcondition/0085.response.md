Postcondition: **`i` is the last index processed by the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is `t - i`, `f` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the maximum value in `a`. If no index `i` satisfies the condition `a[i] == m` and either `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`, then `i` remains 0; otherwise, `i` is incremented appropriately based on the conditions.**
