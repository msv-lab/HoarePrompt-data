The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `a`. This impacts the value of `a` and the value of `m`, which was previously defined as the maximum value in the original list `a`.

Since the initial value of `a` is a list of integers, and the code replaces this list with a new one read from input, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the new list without knowing the user's input. However, we know that `m` will now be the maximum value in this new list.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `m` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1**.
