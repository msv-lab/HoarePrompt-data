The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `i` is initially equal to `n`, and `t` is updated to `t - 1`. However, since the value of `t` before this operation is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `t` after the operation. The variable `f` remains 0 unless any element in the list `a` satisfies a specific condition involving `m`, but this condition is not relevant to the given code snippet.

Therefore, the only change made by the code is assigning an integer input to `n`, while `i` remains equal to the original value of `n`, and `t` is decreased by 1. The initial state of `f` is 0, and it remains unchanged because no conditions related to `f` are met in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1`, `f` is 0**
