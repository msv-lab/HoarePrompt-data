`f` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `n`. The function `func_2(n + 1)` is called but no changes are made to the variables within this snippet. Therefore, the value of `i` remains unchanged as `n`, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 still holds.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n`; `f` is 1**
