Postcondition: ***`i` is an index in the list `a`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `f` is either 1 or 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the maximum value in `a`. If `i - 1 >= 0` and `a[i] > a[i - 1]` or `(i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1])`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.***
