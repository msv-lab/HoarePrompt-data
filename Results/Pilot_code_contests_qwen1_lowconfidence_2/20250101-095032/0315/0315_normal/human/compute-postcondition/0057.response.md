The function `func_2(-1)` is called with `-1` as an argument. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine what changes this function might make to the variables. Given the lack of information about `func_2`, we assume that the function does not modify any of the existing variables or add any new ones. Therefore, the only variables mentioned are `i`, `n`, and `f`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is 0**
