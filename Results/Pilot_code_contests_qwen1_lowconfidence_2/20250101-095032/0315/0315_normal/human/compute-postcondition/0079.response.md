The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, which increments `i` by 1. However, the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we only know that `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2 greater than its previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t-1`, `f` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`**
