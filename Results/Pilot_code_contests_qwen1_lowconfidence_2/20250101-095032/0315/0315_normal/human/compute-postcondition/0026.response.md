Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- \( t \) must be greater than 0.
- \( n \) is an input integer.
- \( a \) is a list of integers created by converting each input integer to int.
- \( m \) is the maximum value in \( a \).
- \( f \) is 0.
- \( _ \) is the loop variable starting from 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates from \( i = 0 \) to \( i = n-1 \). For each iteration, it checks if the current element \( a[i] \) is equal to \( m \) (the maximum value in the list), and if so, it further checks if this element is greater than its adjacent elements.

If both conditions are met (i.e., \( a[i] == m \) and either \( i - 1 \geq 0 \) and \( a[i] > a[i - 1] \) or \( i + 1 < n \) and \( a[i] > a[i + 1] \)), the function `func_2(i + 1)` is called, and \( f \) is set to 1, breaking the loop.

### Step-by-Step Output State After All Iterations

#### Final Conditions
- Since the loop terminates only when it finds an element that satisfies the conditions mentioned above and sets \( f \) to 1, the loop will terminate after at most \( n \) iterations.
- If no such element is found, the loop will complete all \( n \) iterations, and \( f \) will remain 0.

#### Variables After the Loop
- \( t \): Must still be greater than 0.
- \( n \): Remains the same.
- \( a \): Remains unchanged.
- \( m \): The maximum value in \( a \) remains the same.
- \( f \): Will be 1 if any element in \( a \) satisfies the conditions, otherwise it will remain 0.
- \( i \): Will be the last index checked by the loop, which is \( n-1 \).

### Output State
- If the loop executes, it means there exists an index \( i \) where \( a[i] == m \) and either \( i - 1 \geq 0 \) and \( a[i] > a[i - 1] \) or \( i + 1 < n \) and \( a[i] > a[i + 1] \). Therefore, \( f \) will be 1, and `func_2(i + 1)` will have been called.
- If the loop does not execute, \( f \) remains 0.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`, `f` is 1 if the loop found an index \( i \) where \( a[i] == m \) and either \( i - 1 \geq 0 \) and \( a[i] > a[i - 1] \) or \( i + 1 < n \) and \( a[i] > a[i + 1] \), otherwise `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**
