Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `i` is equal to `n`. If either `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and the element at index `i` in array `a` is greater than the element at index `i - 1`, or `i + 1` is less than `n` and the element at index `i` in array `a` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains unchanged and is still 0.***
