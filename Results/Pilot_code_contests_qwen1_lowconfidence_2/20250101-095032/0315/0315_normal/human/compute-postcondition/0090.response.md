Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of piranhas and a list `a` of `n` positive integers representing the sizes of the piranhas. It then finds the maximum size `m` of the piranhas in the list `a`. The function checks if any piranha of size `m` has a neighboring piranha of smaller size. If such a piranha is found, it calls `func_2` with the index of the piranha plus one; otherwise, it calls `func_2` with `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `func_2` is called appropriately based on the conditions met during the loop iterations. Potential edge cases include when there are no piranhas of size `m` with a neighboring smaller piranha, or when the list `a` contains only one element.**
