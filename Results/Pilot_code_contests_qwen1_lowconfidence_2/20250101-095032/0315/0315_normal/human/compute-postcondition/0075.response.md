The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. However, no variable values are changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i < n-1` and the new value is `i + 1`, otherwise `i` remains the same; `n` is greater than 0; `t` is `t - 1`; `f` is 1; `a` is a list of integers; `m` is the maximum value in `a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
