According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute as long as `args` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `at_start` is `False`. This indicates that we are already inside the loop and `x` has been set to the current element from `args`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least one more element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` still has elements left to iterate over.

State: **`at_start` is False, `args` must have at least one more element**
