Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `f` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the maximum value in `a`. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `m`. The condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` is true.***
