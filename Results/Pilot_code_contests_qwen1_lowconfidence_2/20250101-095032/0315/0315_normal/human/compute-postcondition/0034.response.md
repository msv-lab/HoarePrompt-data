The code assigns the value `0` to `f`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, and `func_2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `m` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (reduced by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `m` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, `f` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `func_2` has been called with argument `-1**.
