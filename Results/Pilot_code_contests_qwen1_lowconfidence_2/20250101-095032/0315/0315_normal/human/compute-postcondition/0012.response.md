`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. However, the given initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`. Therefore, we can only say that `x` is written to the file as a string, but its specific value remains unknown. The other variables (`at_start` and `args`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` must have at least one more element, `x` is written to the file as a string**
