Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `args` is an empty list or has no elements left to iterate over, the file has been written with `'\n'`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the file buffer is flushed. The value of `kwargs` has been modified by popping 'flush', and the current value of `flush` is either True or False.***
