The function `func_2(-1)` is called, but the definition of `func_2` is not provided. Based on the information given, we can infer that `func_2` might be modifying the value of `i` based on the conditions provided. However, since the exact behavior of `func_2` is not defined, we can only assume that `func_2` might modify `i` based on the conditions described in the initial state.

Given the initial state and the call to `func_2(-1)`, let's analyze the potential impacts:

1. `i` is the last index processed by the loop.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. `t` is `t - i`.
4. `f` is 0.
5. `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
6. `m` is the maximum value in `a`.

Since the function `func_2` is called with `-1`, which is not a typical index for a list (assuming `i` starts from 0), it is likely that the function checks the conditions and does not modify `i` because there is no valid index `-1` in the list. Therefore, `i` remains unchanged.

The value of `t` is updated to `t - (-1)`, which is `t + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is the last index processed by the loop; `n` is a non-negative integer; `t` is `t + 1`; `f` is 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `m` is the maximum value in `a`.**
