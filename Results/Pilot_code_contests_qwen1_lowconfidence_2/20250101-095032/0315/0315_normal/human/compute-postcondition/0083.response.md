Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 greater than its previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t-1`, `f` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `a[i]` equals `m`. Otherwise, the values remain as in the precondition.***
