Postcondition: **`i` is the last index processed by the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is `t + 1`, `f` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the maximum value in `a`. If the condition `f == 0` is true, then `i` is incremented appropriately based on the conditions provided.**
