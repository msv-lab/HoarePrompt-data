The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with `i + 1` as an argument. This changes the value of `i` to `i + 1`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. However, since `i` is now `i + 1`, the condition for the next call to `func_2` might change.

The precondition is that `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` was true before the call. Since `i` is now `i + 1`, the condition will be checked again with the new `i` value. 

The output state is:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `f` is unchanged.
- `a` is unchanged.
- `m` is unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is now `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `f` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `m` is the maximum value in `a`, and the condition `(i - 1 >= 0 and a[i] > a[i - 1] or (i + 1 < n and a[i] > a[i + 1]))` is no longer applicable for the next call.**
