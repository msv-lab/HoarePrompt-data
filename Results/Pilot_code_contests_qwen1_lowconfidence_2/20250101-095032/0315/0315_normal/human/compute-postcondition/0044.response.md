The function `func_2(i + 1)` is called with the argument `i + 1`. Since the initial state of `i` is `n`, the argument passed to `func_2` is `n + 1`. However, the function `func_2` itself is not defined in the given code snippet, so its internal operations are unknown. The values of `n` and `i` are not altered within the given code snippet; they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `n`, and the function `func_2(n + 1)` is called.**
