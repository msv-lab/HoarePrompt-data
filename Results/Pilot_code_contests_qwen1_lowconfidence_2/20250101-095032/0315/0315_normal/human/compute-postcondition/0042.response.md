Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `f` is set to 1 if either `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, or if `i + 1` is less than `n` and `a[i]` is greater than `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the value of `f` remains unchanged from the precondition.***
