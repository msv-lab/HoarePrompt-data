The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated in the given code, the variables retain their initial conditions except for the fact that we have exited the implied context (if it was inside a loop or condition).

Output State: **`i` is 2 greater than its previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is `t-1`, `f` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum value in `a', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
