Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of strings `N` and the length of each string `L` from the input.
   - It then reads `N` strings of length `L` each, storing them in a list `s`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `s` is sorted in lexicographical order using the `sort()` method. This ensures that the strings are arranged in the desired order.

3. **Concatenation**:
   - The sorted list `s` is then concatenated into a single string `ans` by iterating over each string in `s` and appending it to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The final concatenated string `ans` is printed, which is the lexicographically smallest possible string that can be formed by concatenating the given strings in some order.

5. **Handling Constraints**:
   - The program inherently handles the constraints provided in the problem description. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the program ensures that `N` and `L` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100), and each string in `s` is of length `L` and consists of lowercase letters.

6. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - Sorting the list of strings in lexicographical order and then concatenating them ensures that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible combination of the given strings.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all necessary aspects, including input validation and output formatting, the program is correct.
