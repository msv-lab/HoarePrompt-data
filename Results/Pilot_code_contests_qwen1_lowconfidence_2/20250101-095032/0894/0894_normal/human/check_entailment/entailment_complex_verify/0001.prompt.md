You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Iroha has a sequence of N strings S_1, S_2, ..., S_N. The length of each string is L.

She will concatenate all of the strings in some order, to produce a long string.

Among all strings that she can produce in this way, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Here, a string s=s_1s_2s_3...s_n is lexicographically smaller than another string t=t_1t_2t_3...t_m if and only if one of the following holds:

* There exists an index i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), such that s_j = t_j for all indices j(1≦j<i), and s_i<t_i.
* s_i = t_i for all integers i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), and n<m.

Constraints

* 1 ≦ N, L ≦ 100
* For each i, the length of S_i equals L.
* For each i, S_i consists of lowercase letters.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N L
S_1
S_2
:
S_N


Output

Print the lexicographically smallest string that Iroha can produce.

Example

Input

3 3
dxx
axx
cxx


Output

axxcxxdxx
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]
    s.sort()
    ans = ''
    for i in xrange(n):
        ans += s[i]
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the concatenation of the strings to form the lexicographically smallest string. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the list of strings `s` and then concatenates them in the sorted order. However, sorting the strings does not necessarily produce the lexicographically smallest concatenated string, especially when the strings overlap or share common prefixes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
dxx
axx
cxx
```

The correct output should be `axxcxxdxx`, but the program would incorrectly output `dxxaxxcxx`.

To achieve the correct result, the program needs to merge the strings in a way that respects the lexicographical order of the concatenated result, which might require a different approach, such as using a merge sort or a custom comparison function that considers the full concatenated string at each step.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and L are integers such that 1 ≤ N, L ≤ 100. S_1, S_2, ..., S_N are strings of length L consisting of lowercase letters.
def func():
    n, l = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]
    s.sort()
    ans = ''
    for i in xrange(n):
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is the concatenation of all strings in the list `s`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts two integers `N` and `L` (with \(1 \leq N, L \leq 100\)) and a list of `N` strings, each of length `L` consisting of lowercase letters. It sorts the list of strings in lexicographical order and then concatenates all the strings in the sorted list to form a single string `ans`. Finally, it prints the concatenated string `ans`. If `N` is zero or any of the constraints are not met, the function still reads the inputs but does not perform the sorting and concatenation steps, resulting in no output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
