Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not generate the lexicographically smallest string by considering the concatenation order of the strings. Instead, it simply sorts the list of strings lexicographically and concatenates them in that order. While sorting and concatenating the strings in this manner will produce a valid result, it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string.

To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, the code should consider all possible permutations of the strings and choose the permutation that results in the smallest string. Sorting the strings individually and then concatenating them does not take into account the relative ordering of the strings when concatenated together.

For example, given the input:
```
3 3
dxx
axx
cxx
```
The code will sort the strings as `['axx', 'cxx', 'dxx']` and concatenate them to produce `axxcxxdxx`.

However, the lexicographically smallest string would be `axxcxxdxx` if we consider the correct approach, but the current implementation does not ensure this. The correct approach would involve generating all permutations of the strings and checking which permutation produces the smallest concatenated string.

Since the provided code does not handle the required logic to find the lexicographically smallest string, the program is incorrect.
