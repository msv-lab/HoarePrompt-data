Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way the strings are sorted and concatenated. The program sorts the strings lexicographically and then concatenates them in that order, which does not necessarily produce the lexicographically smallest possible string.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
dxx
axx
cxx
```

The program will sort the strings as `['axx', 'cxx', 'dxx']` and concatenate them to form `axxcxxdxx`. However, the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by rearranging the concatenation order is `axxcxxdxx`, but the correct answer should be `axxcxxdxx` (the same output in this specific case, but the logic is flawed).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all permutations of the strings and choose the one that results in the lexicographically smallest concatenated string. Sorting alone is not sufficient to guarantee the smallest result.

A correct approach would involve generating all permutations of the strings and comparing the concatenated results to find the smallest one, but this is computationally expensive for larger inputs. However, given the constraints (N and L are at most 100), a more efficient algorithm could be devised.
