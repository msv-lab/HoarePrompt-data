The function `func()` accepts two integers `N` and `L` (with \(1 \leq N, L \leq 100\)) and a list of `N` strings, each of length `L` consisting of lowercase letters. It sorts the list of strings in lexicographical order and then concatenates all the strings in the sorted list to form a single string `ans`. Finally, it prints the concatenated string `ans`. If `N` is zero or any of the constraints are not met, the function still reads the inputs but does not perform the sorting and concatenation steps, resulting in no output.
