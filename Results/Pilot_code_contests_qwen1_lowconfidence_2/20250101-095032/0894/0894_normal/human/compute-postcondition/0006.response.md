According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the condition `n > 0` holds true, and `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, and `ans` contains `s[i]` appended to the original value of `ans`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the values of `i` and ensure that `i < n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was the value it ended on (let's call this value `i_end`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_end + 1`.

Given that `n > 0`, the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`, and the condition `n > 0` must still hold.

The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is a string containing `s[i_end]` appended to the original value of `ans`, `i` is `i_end + 1`**
