The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of the variable `ans`, which is the concatenation of all strings in the list `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is printed and equals the concatenation of all strings in the list `s`**
