The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints, it implies that the function should internally handle two integers `N` and `L` such that \(1 \leq N, L \leq 100\), and \(N\) strings \(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N\) each of length \(L\) consisting of lowercase letters. 

Given the output cases are not specified directly but inferred from the problem description, the function likely processes these inputs and returns some form of result. Since no specific output cases are given, we'll focus on the inputs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle two integers `N` and `L` with the specified constraints and a list of `N` strings of length `L` each, consisting of lowercase letters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers N and L such that \(1 \leq N, L \leq 100\), and a list of N strings, each of length L consisting of lowercase letters.**
