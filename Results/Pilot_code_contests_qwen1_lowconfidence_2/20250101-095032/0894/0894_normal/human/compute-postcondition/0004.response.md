According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, and `i` starts from 0 and iterates up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `l` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters
- `ans` is an empty string

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. This is because if `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0

Let's summarize this in the required format:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is an empty string**
