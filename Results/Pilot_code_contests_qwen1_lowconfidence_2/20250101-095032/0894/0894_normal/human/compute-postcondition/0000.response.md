The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `l`. The initial state specifies that `N` and `L` are integers between 1 and 100, and `S_1, S_2, ..., S_N` are strings of length `L` consisting of lowercase letters. After executing the code, `N` and `L` will be replaced by the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S_1, S_2, ..., S_N` are strings of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters**
