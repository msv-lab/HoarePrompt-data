The code `s = [raw_input() for _ in xrange(n)]` creates a list `s` containing `n` elements, each of which is a string obtained from user input. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `S_1, S_2, ..., S_N` are strings of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, the new list `s` will contain `n` strings, each of length `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters**
