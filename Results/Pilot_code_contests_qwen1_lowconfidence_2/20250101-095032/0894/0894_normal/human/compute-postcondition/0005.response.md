`ans` is assigned the value of `ans` concatenated with `s[i]`. The value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine exactly what string from `s` is being added to `ans`. However, we know that `s` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `l`, and they are sorted in lexicographical order.

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is a string containing `s[i]` appended to the original value of `ans`**.
