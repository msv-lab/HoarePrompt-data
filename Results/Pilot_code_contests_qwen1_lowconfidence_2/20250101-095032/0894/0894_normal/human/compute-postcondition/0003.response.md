The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, or the contents of `s`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is an empty string**
