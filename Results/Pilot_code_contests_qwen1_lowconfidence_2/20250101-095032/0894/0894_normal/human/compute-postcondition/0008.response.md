According to the code, the loop condition is determined by the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `l` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters
- `ans` is a string containing `s[i_end]` appended to the original value of `ans`
- `i` is `i_end + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `i_end + 1`, for the loop to continue, `i_end + 1` must be less than `n`. This means `i_end` must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `i` is incremented to `i_end + 2`
- `i` must still be less than `n` (since `i_end + 1 < n` implies `i_end + 2 < n`)

Given the conditions, the state remains the same in terms of `n`, `l`, `s`, and `ans` because these variables do not change within the loop itself.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is a string containing `s[i_end]` appended to the original value of `ans`, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
