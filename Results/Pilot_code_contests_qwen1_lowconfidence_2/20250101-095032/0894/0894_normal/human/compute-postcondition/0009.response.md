The code `ans += s[i]` appends the string at index `i` of list `s` to the string `ans`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` must be greater than 0
- `l` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters
- `ans` is a string containing `s[i_end]` appended to the original value of `ans`
- `i` is `i_end + 2`

After executing the code `ans += s[i]`:

- The value of `ans` changes by appending the string at index `i` of list `s` to the current value of `ans`.
- The value of `i` is updated to `i_end + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is the original value of `ans` concatenated with the string at index `i` of list `s`, `i` is `i_end + 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a list of `n` strings sorted in lexicographical order, each string of length `l` consisting of lowercase letters, `ans` is the original value of `ans` concatenated with the string at index `i` of list `s`, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
