The function processes `k` sequences of integers, where each sequence is defined by an integer `ni` and a list of `ni` integers. It aims to find two elements from different sequences such that their sums are equal. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of these elements from their respective sequences and exits. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO". The function reads `k` from the input, followed by `ni` and the sequence of integers for each of the `k` sequences. It uses a dictionary `tk` to store pairs of indices and values that could potentially form the required sum.
