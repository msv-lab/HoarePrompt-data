k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. For each i from 1 to k, n_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sequences are lists of n_i integers where each integer is in the range from -10^4 to 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all sequences does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, i.e., n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
