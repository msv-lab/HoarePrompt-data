Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of sequences (`k`) and each sequence’s length (`n_i`) along with the elements of the sequences. This is evident from the loops and input handling parts of the code.

2. **Sum Calculation and Dictionary Use**: The program calculates the sum of each sequence and stores it in the `s` variable. It also maintains a dictionary `tk` to map the difference between each element and the sum of its sequence to a list of tuples containing the sequence index and the index of the element in that sequence. This helps in identifying if there are two sequences with the same reduced sum after removing one element each.

3. **Finding a Valid Pair**: During the processing of each sequence, the program checks if there already exists another sequence with the same reduced sum. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" followed by the required indices and exits, satisfying the problem’s requirement to find two sequences meeting the criteria and print their indices.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge cases as per the problem description:
   - It ensures that it finds a pair of distinct sequences.
   - It correctly identifies the indices of the elements to be removed.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints "NO".

Given these points, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem, making it correct according to the problem description.
