You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given k sequences of integers. The length of the i-th sequence equals to n_i.

You have to choose exactly two sequences i and j (i ≠ j) such that you can remove exactly one element in each of them in such a way that the sum of the changed sequence i (its length will be equal to n_i - 1) equals to the sum of the changed sequence j (its length will be equal to n_j - 1).

Note that it's required to remove exactly one element in each of the two chosen sequences.

Assume that the sum of the empty (of the length equals 0) sequence is 0.

Input

The first line contains an integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of sequences.

Then k pairs of lines follow, each pair containing a sequence.

The first line in the i-th pair contains one integer n_i (1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the i-th sequence. The second line of the i-th pair contains a sequence of n_i integers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, n_i}.

The elements of sequences are integer numbers from -10^4 to 10^4.

The sum of lengths of all given sequences don't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, i.e. n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

If it is impossible to choose two sequences such that they satisfy given conditions, print "NO" (without quotes). Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes), in the second line — two integers i, x (1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ x ≤ n_i), in the third line — two integers j, y (1 ≤ j ≤ k, 1 ≤ y ≤ n_j). It means that the sum of the elements of the i-th sequence without the element with index x equals to the sum of the elements of the j-th sequence without the element with index y.

Two chosen sequences must be distinct, i.e. i ≠ j. You can print them in any order.

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

4 1

Note

In the first example there are two sequences [2, 3, 1, 3, 2] and [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]. You can remove the second element from the first sequence to get [2, 1, 3, 2] and you can remove the sixth element from the second sequence to get [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. The sums of the both resulting sequences equal to 8, i.e. the sums are equal.
Program:
```
def func():
    k = int(raw_input())
    tk = dict()
    jam = []
    flag = 0
    for l in range(k):
        ni = int(raw_input())
        arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        jam.append(arr)
        s = sum(arr)
        sk = list(set(arr))
        for i in sk:
            tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
            tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
            if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
                if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
                    print('YES')
                    print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
                    print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
                    exit(0)
    if not flag:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it checks for the condition where removing one element from each of the two sequences results in equal sums. Specifically, the program uses `set(arr)` to eliminate duplicate elements before checking for the difference between the sum of the sequence and each unique element. This approach fails to consider cases where the sum of the sequence minus the element is the same for different indices within the sequence.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 2 1 2
3
1 1 1
2
2 2
```

In this case, the program should identify that removing the second element from the first sequence (resulting in [1, 1, 2]) and removing the first element from the second sequence (resulting in [1, 1]) would make their sums equal (2 in both cases). However, the current implementation might not correctly identify this scenario because it checks for the difference using sets, which do not account for multiple occurrences of the same value at different indices.

To fix this, the program should directly check the sum of the sequence minus each element at its respective index without relying on sets. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
for l in range(k):
    ni = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = sum(arr)
    for i in range(ni):
        if s - arr[i] in tk:
            for (j, idx) in tk[s - arr[i]]:
                if j != l:
                    print('YES')
                    print(str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 1))
                    print(str(j + 1) + ' ' + str(idx + 1))
                    exit(0)
    tk[s].append((l, i))
```

This version ensures that the program correctly identifies the indices where removing an element from each sequence results in equal sums.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. For each i from 1 to k, n_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sequences are lists of n_i integers where each integer is in the range from -10^4 to 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all sequences does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, i.e., n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    k = int(raw_input())

                if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
                    print('YES')
                    print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
                    print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided by the input, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is the input integer, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`. If the loop finds a valid pair, `tk[i - s]` contains more than one element, otherwise, `tk[i - s]` contains at most one element.
    if (not flag) :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. If the condition `not flag` is true (which means the loop did not find a valid pair), `tk[i - s]` contains at most one element. Otherwise, `tk[i - s]` contains more than one element. `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided by the input, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` remains 0, `ni` is the input integer, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `k` sequences of integers, where each sequence is defined by an integer `ni` and a list of `ni` integers. It aims to find two elements from different sequences such that their sums are equal. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of these elements from their respective sequences and exits. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO". The function reads `k` from the input, followed by `ni` and the sequence of integers for each of the `k` sequences. It uses a dictionary `tk` to store pairs of indices and values that could potentially form the required sum.
