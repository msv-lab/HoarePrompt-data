Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it checks for the condition where removing one element from each of the two sequences results in equal sums. Specifically, the program uses `set(arr)` to eliminate duplicate elements before checking for the difference between the sum of the sequence and each unique element. This approach fails to consider cases where the sum of the sequence minus the element is the same for different indices within the sequence.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 2 1 2
3
1 1 1
2
2 2
```

In this case, the program should identify that removing the second element from the first sequence (resulting in [1, 1, 2]) and removing the first element from the second sequence (resulting in [1, 1]) would make their sums equal (2 in both cases). However, the current implementation might not correctly identify this scenario because it checks for the difference using sets, which do not account for multiple occurrences of the same value at different indices.

To fix this, the program should directly check the sum of the sequence minus each element at its respective index without relying on sets. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
for l in range(k):
    ni = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = sum(arr)
    for i in range(ni):
        if s - arr[i] in tk:
            for (j, idx) in tk[s - arr[i]]:
                if j != l:
                    print('YES')
                    print(str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 1))
                    print(str(j + 1) + ' ' + str(idx + 1))
                    exit(0)
    tk[s].append((l, i))
```

This version ensures that the program correctly identifies the indices where removing an element from each sequence results in equal sums.
