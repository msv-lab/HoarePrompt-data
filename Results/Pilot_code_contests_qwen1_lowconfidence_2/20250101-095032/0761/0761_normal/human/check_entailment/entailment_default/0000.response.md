Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the code attempts to find two elements from different sequences such that their sums are equal after removing one element from each sequence. However, the code has a logical error in how it checks for the equality of sums after removing elements.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Dictionary Construction**: The code constructs a dictionary `tk` where the keys are the differences between the element value and the sum of the sequence. The values are lists of tuples, each tuple containing the sequence index and the index of the element in that sequence.

2. **Checking for Equal Sums**: When a key is added to `tk` more than once, it checks if the sequences corresponding to the indices are different. If they are, it prints "YES" and the indices of the elements that can be removed.

However, the code does not correctly ensure that the sums of the modified sequences are equal. Instead, it only checks if the elements' values minus the sum of their respective sequences result in the same key in the dictionary, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the sums of the modified sequences will be equal.

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:
```
3
5
2 3 1 3 2
5
1 1 2 2 2
5
2 2 2 2 2
```

- Sequence 1: \([2, 3, 1, 3, 2]\)
- Sequence 2: \([1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\)
- Sequence 3: \([2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\)

For Sequence 1, the dictionary `tk` will have entries like:
- \(2 - 12 = -10\): \([(0, 1)]\)
- \(3 - 12 = -9\): \([(0, 2)]\)
- \(1 - 12 = -11\): \([(0, 3)]\)
- \(3 - 12 = -9\): \([(0, 4)]\)

For Sequence 2, the dictionary `tk` will have entries like:
- \(1 - 10 = -9\): \([(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]\)

For Sequence 3, the dictionary `tk` will have entries like:
- \(2 - 10 = -8\): \([(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]\)

When checking for equality, the code will incorrectly conclude that removing the 4th element from Sequence 1 (\(3\)) and the 2nd element from Sequence 3 (\(2\)) results in equal sums:
- Sequence 1 after removal: \([2, 3, 1, 2]\) with sum \(8\)
- Sequence 3 after removal: \([2, 2, 2, 2]\) with sum \(8\)

However, the correct approach would be to check the actual sums of the modified sequences. For instance, removing the 2nd element from Sequence 2:
- Sequence 2 after removal: \([1, 2, 2, 2]\) with sum \(7\)

Thus, the code fails to correctly implement the requirement to ensure the sums of the modified sequences are equal.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
