Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it checks for the possibility of choosing two sequences that meet the criteria. Specifically, the program uses `set(arr)` to find unique elements in each sequence and then calculates the difference between each unique element and the sum of the sequence (`i - s`). This approach assumes that the sequence will contain at least one element that, when removed, will result in the same sum as another sequence after removing one of its elements.

However, this logic does not guarantee that the sums of the modified sequences will be equal. For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 2 3 4
4
2 3 4 5
4
1 2 3 5
```

In this case, the program would incorrectly conclude that the sums are equal because it finds a common value in the sets of unique elements, but it fails to check if removing that element from one sequence results in the same sum as removing an element from another sequence.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly calculate the sums of all possible modified sequences and compare them. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    k = int(input())
    sequences = []

    for _ in range(k):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        sequences.append(arr)

    # Check all pairs of sequences
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i + 1, k):
            seq1 = sequences[i]
            seq2 = sequences[j]
            for x in range(len(seq1)):
                for y in range(len(seq2)):
                    sum1 = sum(seq1[:x] + seq1[x+1:])
                    sum2 = sum(seq2[:y] + seq2[y+1:])
                    if sum1 == sum2:
                        print("YES")
                        print(f"{i + 1} {x + 1}")
                        print(f"{j + 1} {y + 1}")
                        return

    print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs of sequences and all possible removals within those sequences to ensure that the sums match.
