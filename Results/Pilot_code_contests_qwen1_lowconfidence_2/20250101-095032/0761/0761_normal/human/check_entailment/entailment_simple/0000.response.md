Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program does not check all pairs of sequences to see if removing one element from each can result in equal sums. Instead, it processes each sequence individually and checks if there is a complementary element in the `tk` dictionary. This approach may miss valid solutions where the complementary element exists in another sequence.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Single Sequence Processing**: The program iterates through each sequence individually and tries to find a complementary element within the same sequence (`i - s`). This means it does not consider the possibility that the complementary element might exist in a different sequence.

2. **No Pairwise Comparison**: The program does not compare each sequence with every other sequence to find a valid pair that can satisfy the condition. It only checks if there is a complementary element in the same sequence, which is not sufficient.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate over all pairs of sequences.
- For each pair, calculate the sum of each sequence minus each element.
- Check if the sums of the modified sequences from two different sequences are equal.

Here is an outline of how the corrected program could look:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    k = int(input())
    sequences = []
    
    for _ in range(k):
        ni = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        sequences.append(arr)
    
    for i, seq1 in enumerate(sequences):
        for j, seq2 in enumerate(sequences):
            if i == j:
                continue
            for x in range(len(seq1)):
                for y in range(len(seq2)):
                    sum_seq1 = sum(seq1) - seq1[x]
                    sum_seq2 = sum(seq2) - seq2[y]
                    if sum_seq1 == sum_seq2:
                        print("YES")
                        print(f"{i + 1} {x + 1}")
                        print(f"{j + 1} {y + 1}")
                        return
    print("NO")

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all pairs of sequences are considered and checks if removing one element from each sequence results in equal sums.
