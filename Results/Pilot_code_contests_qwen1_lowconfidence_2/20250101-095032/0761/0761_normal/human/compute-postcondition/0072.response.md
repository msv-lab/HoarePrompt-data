The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that no further changes are made to any variables. The only information we know from the initial state is that `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, and the printed statement is the string `str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`. Since the program terminates without any further assignments or changes, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, printed statement is the string `str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i + 2) + 1)` and the output is the string `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`**
