The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables, but it changes the state of the console output. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, the console displays 'YES'**
