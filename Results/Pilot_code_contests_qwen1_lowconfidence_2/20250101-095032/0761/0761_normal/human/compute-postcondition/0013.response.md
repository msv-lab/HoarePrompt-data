Postcondition: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to an empty list, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, and an error occurs due to the non-existent key `i - s`. The length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1.**
