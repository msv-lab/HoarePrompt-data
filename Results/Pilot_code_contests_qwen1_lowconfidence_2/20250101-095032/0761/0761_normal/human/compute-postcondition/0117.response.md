Functionality: **The function processes `k` sequences of integers, where each sequence is defined by an integer `ni` and a list of `ni` integers. It aims to find two elements from different sequences such that their sums are equal. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of these elements from their respective sequences and exits. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO". The function reads `k` from the input, followed by `ni` and the sequence of integers for each of the `k` sequences. It uses a dictionary `tk` to store pairs of indices and values that could potentially form the required sum.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If all sequences are empty, the function will not find any valid pair and will print "NO".
- If there are duplicate sequences or duplicate values within a sequence, the function will still process them as individual elements.
- If the sequences are very large (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) integers each), the function may take a significant amount of time to execute due to the nested loops and set operations.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer inputs for `k` or `ni`, or out-of-range integers in the sequences.
- There is no error handling for I/O operations like `raw_input()`, which could fail if the input stream is closed or invalid.
