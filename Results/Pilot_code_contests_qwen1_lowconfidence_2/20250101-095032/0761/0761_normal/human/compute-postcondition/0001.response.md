The line `tk = dict()` creates an empty dictionary and assigns it to the variable `tk`. This operation does not change the value of `k`, which remains an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `tk` is an empty dictionary**
