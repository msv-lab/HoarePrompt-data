The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` concatenated as a string. Since `tk[i - s][0][0]` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` are part of the precondition, we need to include them in the output state. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to an empty list, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, the print statement outputs 'YES', `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state.**
