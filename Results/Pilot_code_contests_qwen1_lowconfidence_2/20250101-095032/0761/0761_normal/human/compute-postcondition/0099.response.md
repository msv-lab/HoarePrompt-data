The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately with a status code of 0. Since the program exits, no further operations are performed, and all variables retain their current values until the end of the execution.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`, `i` is the next unique element in `sk`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, the printed values are `str(l + 1)` and `str(arr.index(i) + 2)`**
