The code prints the value of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` followed by the value of `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Since `tk[i - s]` includes the additional tuple `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`, the first element of `tk[i - s]` is `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`. Thus, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `k` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the printed output will be `str(k + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)`.

The variables `i`, `s`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `sk`, `l`, and the length of `tk[i - s]` remain unchanged, except that the first element of `tk[i - s]` is now explicitly known.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` includes the tuple `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)` as its first element, `i` is the last unique element that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, and the first element of `jam` is not equal to the second element of `jam`; printed output is `str(k + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)`**.
