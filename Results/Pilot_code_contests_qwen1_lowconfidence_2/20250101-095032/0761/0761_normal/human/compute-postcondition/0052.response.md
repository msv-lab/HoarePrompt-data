The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` concatenated as a string. The values of `tk[i - s][0][0]` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` are taken from the original list `tk[i - s]`. Since these values are part of the tuple in `tk[i - s]`, they remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now the original list plus the new tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `tk`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, and the value of `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`; the console displays 'YES', the console also displays the string `str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1])`**
