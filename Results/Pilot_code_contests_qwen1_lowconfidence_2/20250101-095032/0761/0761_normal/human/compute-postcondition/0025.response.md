The code prints the value of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` followed by the value of `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is the first element of the list `tk[i - s][0]`, which is `0` because the list is `[]`. So, `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` is `1`. The second element of the list `tk[i - s][0]` is `tk[i - s][1][1]`, which is `tk[i - s][1][1]` itself.

Therefore, the printed values are `'1'` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[[], [1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, and the print statement outputs '1' and `tk[i - s][1][1]`.**
