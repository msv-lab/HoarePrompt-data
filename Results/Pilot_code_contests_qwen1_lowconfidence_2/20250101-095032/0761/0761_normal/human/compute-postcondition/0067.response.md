The code `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` checks if the key `i - s` exists in the dictionary `tk`. If it does not exist, it assigns an empty list to `tk[i - s]`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `s` remains unchanged
- `l` remains unchanged
- `arr` remains unchanged

The code does not directly modify the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` or the value of `i`. It only ensures that `tk[i - s]` is set to an empty list if it was not already present.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
- `tk[i - s]` is now an empty list if it was not previously defined, otherwise it remains the same (a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`).
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `s` remains unchanged
- `l` remains unchanged
- `arr` remains unchanged

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is an empty list if it was not previously defined, otherwise it remains the same (a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`), `i` is `i + 2`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged.**
