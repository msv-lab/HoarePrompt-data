The code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- The initial state is such that `tk[i - s]` is an empty list if it was not previously defined, otherwise it remains the same (a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`).
- The variable `i` is set to `i + 2`.
- The variable `s` remains unchanged.
- The variable `l` remains unchanged.
- The variable `arr` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

1. `tk[i - s]` will be updated to include the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
2. The value of `i` changes to `i + 2`.

The exact content of `tk[i - s]` depends on its previous state, but since it is an empty list initially or contains the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, appending the new tuple will modify it accordingly.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged.**
