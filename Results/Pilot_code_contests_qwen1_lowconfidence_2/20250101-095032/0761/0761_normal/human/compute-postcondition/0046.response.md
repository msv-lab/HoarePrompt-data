According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sk`. The loop will execute if `sk` is not empty, meaning it contains at least one element.

Here's the breakdown of the necessary adjustments:

1. **`k`**: This is the input value from `raw_input()` and doesn't directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information.
2. **`tk`**: This dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
3. **`jam`**: This list containing the updated `arr` appended to it is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
4. **`flag`**: This flag being 0 or 1 does not directly impact the loop's execution.
5. **`ni`**: This is an integer input from the user and does not directly affect the loop's execution.
6. **`s`**: This is the sum of the elements in `arr` and is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
7. **`sk`**: This is the list of unique elements from `arr`. For the loop to execute, `sk` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `sk` must contain at least one element.

State: **`sk` must contain at least one element**
