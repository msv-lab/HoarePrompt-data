`s` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `arr`. The value of `arr` is the same as it was in the initial state. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`**
