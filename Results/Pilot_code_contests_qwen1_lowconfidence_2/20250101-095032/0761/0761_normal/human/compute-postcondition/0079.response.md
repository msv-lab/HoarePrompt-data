The code appends the list `arr` to the list `jam`. This changes the value of `jam` to include the new list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `arr` is updated with the integers from the input, `jam` is now `[arr]`, `jam` has the new list appended, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is now `k`**
