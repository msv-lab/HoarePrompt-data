The code `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. From the initial state, we know that `tk[i - s][0]` is an empty list `[]` and `tk[i - s][1][0]` is 1. This implies that `tk[i - s]` initially has two elements, the first being an empty list and the second being a list with `[1, tk[i - s][1][1]]`.

Given this, after appending `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to `tk[i - s]`, the updated structure of `tk[i - s]` will be `[[], [1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]]`.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[[], [1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, the print statement outputs 'YES'.**
