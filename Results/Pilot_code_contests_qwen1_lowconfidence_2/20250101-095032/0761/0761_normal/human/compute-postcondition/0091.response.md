Postcondition: ***`tk[i - s]` includes the tuple `(k + 1, arr.index(i) + 1)` as its first element, `i` is the last unique element that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, and the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, provided that the first element of `jam` is not equal to the second element of `jam`. If the first element of `jam` is equal to the second element of `jam`, the postcondition does not change from the precondition.***
