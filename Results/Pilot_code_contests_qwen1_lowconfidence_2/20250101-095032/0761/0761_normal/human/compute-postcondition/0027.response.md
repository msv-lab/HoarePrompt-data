The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately with a status code of 0. This means that no further code in the program will be executed, and the current state of the variables will be the final state.

- The print statement `print('1', tk[i - s][1][1])` is executed before the program exits. It prints '1' and the value of `tk[i - s][1][1]`.
- The value of `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `[1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, but since the program exits immediately, this value will not be printed again after the exit.
- All other variables (`k`, `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `s`, `sk`) retain their values as they are not affected by the `exit(0)` statement.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[[], [1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, and the print statement has executed with output '1' and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. The program has exited.**
