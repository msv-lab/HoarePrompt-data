The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided by the input, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is the input integer, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.**
