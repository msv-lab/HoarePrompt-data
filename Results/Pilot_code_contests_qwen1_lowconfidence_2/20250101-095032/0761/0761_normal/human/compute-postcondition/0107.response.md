The code snippet prints the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]` or `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`. Since `tk[i - s][1]` is common in both cases, we can focus on this part.

- If `tk[i - s]` is `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, then `tk[i - s][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 2`.
- If `tk[i - s]` is `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`, then `tk[i - s][1]` is also `arr.index(i) + 2`.

In both cases, `tk[i - s][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 2`. Therefore, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `arr.index(i) + 2` (which is the first element in the list), and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is the second element which is 0 since `tk[i - s][1]` is a single-element list in this context.

So, the print statement evaluates to `str((arr.index(i) + 2) + 1) + ' ' + str(0)` which simplifies to `str(arr.index(i) + 3) + ' ' + str(0)`.

Given the initial state, the only variables directly affected by this code are those involved in the print statement. The other variables remain unchanged. The output of the print statement will be `arr.index(i) + 3 0`.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]` or `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`; `i` is the next unique element in `sk` (i.e., `i + 1`); `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`; `jam` is `[arr]`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`; `l` is `k`; printed output is `arr.index(i) + 3 0`.**
