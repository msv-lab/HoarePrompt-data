The code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Since `tk[i - s]` is a key in the dictionary `tk` (either already exists or is set to an empty list if it doesn't), the code will modify the list associated with this key.

- `tk[i - s]` is updated by appending the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to it.
- The other variables `tk`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now the original list plus the new tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `tk`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**
