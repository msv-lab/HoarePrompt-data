The code `sk = list(set(arr))` creates a new list `sk` from the set of elements in `arr`. Since `arr` is part of the list `jam`, we need to consider its current state. The initial state tells us that `jam` contains the list `arr`, and `arr` has a sum `s`.

Given that `arr` is a list and `s` is the sum of its elements, `set(arr)` removes duplicate elements from `arr`, and converting this set back to a list results in a list without duplicates.

Therefore, `sk` will contain the unique elements of `arr`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`**
