The code `print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))` does not directly assign any new values to variables. Instead, it prints values from `tk[i - s][1]` and increments the first element of the tuple by 1. Since `tk[i - s][1]` is a tuple and we don't know its exact values, we will keep it as is, but note that the first element will be incremented.

Let's break it down:

1. `tk[i - s][1]` is a tuple with two elements.
2. The first element of this tuple is incremented by 1.
3. The second element remains unchanged.
4. The updated tuple is printed in the format `'number number'`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state.
- `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state.
- `tk[i - s][1]` is a tuple (let's denote it as `(a, b)`).

After executing the code, the first element of `tk[i - s][1]` becomes `a + 1`.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[tk[i - s][0], [tk[i - s][1][0] + 1, tk[i - s][1][1]]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, the print statement outputs 'YES', `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `tk[i - s][1][1]`.**
