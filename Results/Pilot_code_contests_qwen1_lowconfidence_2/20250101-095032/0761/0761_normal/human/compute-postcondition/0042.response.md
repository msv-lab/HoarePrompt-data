The code `arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. 

- `k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, so `k` remains unchanged.
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples, which remains unchanged.
- `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, so `jam` is updated to contain the new `arr`.
- `flag` is 0, which remains unchanged.
- `ni` is an integer input from the user, which remains unchanged.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, but since `arr` is not defined yet, we cannot determine the exact value of `s` at this point.
- `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, which remains unchanged.
- `l` is 0, which remains unchanged.

After executing the code, `arr` is updated to the list of integers read from the input. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples, `jam` is a list containing the updated `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an integer input from the user, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is 0**.
