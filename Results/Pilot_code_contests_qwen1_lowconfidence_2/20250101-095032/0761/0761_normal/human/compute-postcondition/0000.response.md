`k` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`. This means that `k` now holds the integer value entered by the user through raw_input(). The value of `k` will be an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), as per the initial state. All other sequences and their properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The sequences and their properties remain as described in the initial state.**
