The code prints the value of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` followed by `tk[i - s][1][1]`. From the initial state, we know that `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `0` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `tk[i - s][1][1]`.

Therefore, the printed values will be `1` (since `0 + 1` is `1`) and `tk[i - s][1][1]`.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[[], [1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, and the print statement outputs '1' and `tk[i - s][1][1]`.**
