The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk[i - s]` is now a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element remaining; print statement outputs 'YES'**
