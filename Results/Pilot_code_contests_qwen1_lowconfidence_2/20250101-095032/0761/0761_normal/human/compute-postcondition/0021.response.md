Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments to the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State
- \( k \) is the input value of `raw_input()`.
- \( tk \) is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[tk[i - s][0], [tk[i - s][1][0] + 1, tk[i - s][1][1]]]`.
- \( jam \) is a list containing the list `arr`.
- \( flag \) is 0.
- \( ni \) is equal to \( k \).
- \( s \) is the sum of the elements in `arr`.
- \( sk \) is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element.
- The print statement outputs 'YES'.
- `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state.
- `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state.
- `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `tk[i - s][1][1]`.
- These changes occur if `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` is true. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for i in sk:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `sk`.
2. **State Changes Inside the Loop**: Inside the loop, the following checks and updates might happen:
   - `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state.
   - `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state.
   - `tk[i - s][1][0]` is incremented by 1.
   - `tk[i - s][1][1]` remains unchanged.
   - These changes occur only if `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` is true.

### Adjusting States
Since the loop is iterating over each element `i` in `sk`, we need to check if the condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` holds for any `i`.

#### Key Points to Consider:
- If the condition is true for any `i`, then the corresponding entries in `tk`, `jam`, and other relevant states will be updated.
- If the condition is false for all `i`, the state remains unchanged.

### Updated States at the Start of the Next Iteration
Assuming the condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` is true for some `i` (let's assume it is true for `i = j`):

- **`tk[j - s][0][0]`**: This value is included in the output state.
- **`tk[j - s][0][1]`**: This value is included in the output state.
- **`tk[j - s][1][0]`**: This value is incremented by 1.
- **`tk[j - s][1][1]`**: This value remains unchanged.
- **`jam`**: No change since no new elements are added or removed.
- **`flag`**: Remains 0.
- **`ni`**: Remains equal to `k`.
- **`s`**: Remains the sum of the elements in `arr`.
- **`sk`**: Remains the list of unique elements from `arr`.

### Final State Adjustment
If the condition is true for some `i`, then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[tk[i - s][0], [tk[i - s][1][0] + 1, tk[i - s][1][1]]]` where the condition holds for some `i`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `tk[i - s][1][1]`.**

If the condition is false for all `i`, the state remains unchanged.

**State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[tk[i - s][0], [tk[i - s][1][0] + 1, tk[i - s][1][1]]]` if the condition holds, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, the print statement outputs 'YES', `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `tk[i - s][1][1]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
