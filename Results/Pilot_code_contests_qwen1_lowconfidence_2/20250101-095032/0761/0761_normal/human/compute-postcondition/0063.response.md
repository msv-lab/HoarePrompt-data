The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately without further execution of any subsequent statements. Since the program terminates, no further changes to the variables occur. The states of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, the console displays `l + 1` `arr.index(i) + 1`**
