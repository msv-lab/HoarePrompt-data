The code snippet `print('YES')` does not change any variables or their values. It only prints 'YES' to the console. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now the original list plus the new tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `tk`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, and the value of `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`; the console displays 'YES'**
