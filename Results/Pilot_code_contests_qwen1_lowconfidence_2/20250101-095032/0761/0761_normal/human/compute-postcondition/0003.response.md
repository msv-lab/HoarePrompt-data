The variable `flag` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `k`, `tk`, and `jam` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `tk` is an empty dictionary; `jam` is an empty list; `flag` is 0.

Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `tk` is an empty dictionary; `jam` is an empty list; `flag` is 0**
