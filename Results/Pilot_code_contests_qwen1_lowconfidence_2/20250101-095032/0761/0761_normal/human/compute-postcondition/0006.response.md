The code `arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the user input as a sequence of space-separated integers. For example, if the user inputs "1 2 3", then `arr` will be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Given this, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the user input.**
