The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. According to the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. Thus, `tk[i - s][1]` is the tuple itself, and `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `l` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

So, the code will print `str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Since the printed values are derived from the tuple in `tk[i - s]`, we can directly substitute the values:

- `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `l`.
- `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated printed values, while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, the console displays `l + 1` `arr.index(i) + 1`**
