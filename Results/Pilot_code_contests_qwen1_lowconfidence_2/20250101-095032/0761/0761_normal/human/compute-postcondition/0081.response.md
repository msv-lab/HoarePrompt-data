The code `sk = list(set(arr))` converts the list `arr` into a set to remove duplicates, and then back into a list. Since `arr` contains integers, the set operation will eliminate duplicate integers, and `sk` will be a list of unique integers from `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`
- `arr` is updated with the integers from the input
- `jam` is now `[arr]`, with the new list appended
- `flag` is 0
- `ni` is an input integer
- `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`
- `l` is now `k`
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`

After executing the code `sk = list(set(arr))`, the following changes occur:
- `sk` is updated to be a list of unique elements from `arr`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `arr` is updated with the integers from the input, `jam` is now `[arr]`, with the new list appended, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is now `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`**
