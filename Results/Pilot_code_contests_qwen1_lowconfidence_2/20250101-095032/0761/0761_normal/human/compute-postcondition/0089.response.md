The code `print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))` prints the second element of the first tuple in `tk[i - s]`, each element incremented by 1, and the second element of the first tuple in `tk[i - s]`. Since `tk[i - s]` includes the tuple `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)` as its first element, the output will be `str(k + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i) + 1)`. 

The code does not affect the values of any variables other than printing the result. Therefore, the values of `tk`, `i`, `s`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `sk`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` includes the tuple `(k + 1, arr.index(i) + 1)` as its first element, `i` is the last unique element that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, and the first element of `jam` is not equal to the second element of `jam`.**
