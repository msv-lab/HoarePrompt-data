The print statement `'YES'` is executed, which does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[[], [1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, and the print statement outputs 'YES'**.
