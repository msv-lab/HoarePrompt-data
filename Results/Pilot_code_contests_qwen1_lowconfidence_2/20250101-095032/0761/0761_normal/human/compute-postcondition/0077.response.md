`ni` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `tk`, `i`, `s`, `arr`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `sk`, and `l` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `arr` remains unchanged, `jam` remains unchanged, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is now `k`**
