The code `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` attempts to append a tuple to a list in a dictionary. However, there are several issues with this line of code:

1. `tk` is defined as an empty dictionary with a key `i - s` that maps to an empty list: `tk = {'i - s': []}`.
2. The variable `i` is used without being defined in the context provided.
3. The variable `l` is also used without being defined in the context provided.

Since `i` and `l` are not defined, and given the initial state, the dictionary `tk` will not have the key `i - s` because `i` is undefined. Therefore, the operation `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` will raise a `KeyError` due to the non-existent key `i - s`.

Given that the key does not exist, the operation fails and no changes are made to the dictionary. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to an empty list, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, and an error occurs due to the non-existent key `i - s`.**
