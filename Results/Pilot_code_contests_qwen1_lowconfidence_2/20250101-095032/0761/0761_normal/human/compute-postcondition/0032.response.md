The code snippet `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` impacts the `tk` dictionary by appending a tuple to the list that corresponds to the key `i - s`. However, the values of `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` are not specified in the initial state, and no values for these variables are provided.

Given the initial state, let's break down the code:

- `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to an empty list.
- `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`.
- `flag` is 0.
- `ni` is equal to `k`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`.
- `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element remaining.

Since the exact values of `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of the key `i - s`. However, we know that `tk[i - s]` now contains a new element, which is a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk[i - s]` is now a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element remaining.**
