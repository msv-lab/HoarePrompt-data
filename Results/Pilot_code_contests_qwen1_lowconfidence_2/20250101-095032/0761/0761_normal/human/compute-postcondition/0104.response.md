`tk[i - s]` is updated to append `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to its existing value. The initial value of `tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]` or an empty list. After appending, if `tk[i - s]` was initially an empty list, it becomes `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. If `tk[i - s]` was initially `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`, it now becomes `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]` or `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`; `i` is the next unique element in `sk` (i.e., `i + 1`); `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`; `jam` is `[arr]`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`; `l` is `k`.**
