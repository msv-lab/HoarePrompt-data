The code `ni = int(raw_input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `ni`. The previous value of `ni` was `k`, which is now replaced by the integer input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an integer input from the user, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is 0**
