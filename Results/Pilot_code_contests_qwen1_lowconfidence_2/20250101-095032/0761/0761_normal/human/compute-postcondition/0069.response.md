The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'YES' is printed. However, since we need to provide the output state in the specified format and include the unchanged variables, we can state that the print statement does not alter the existing variables.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, print statement executes and outputs 'YES'**
