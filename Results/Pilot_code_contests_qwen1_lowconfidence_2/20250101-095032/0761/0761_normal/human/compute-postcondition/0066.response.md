According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each element in `sk`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `s` remains unchanged
- `l` remains unchanged
- `arr` remains unchanged
- If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console displays `l + 1` and `arr.index(i) + 1`. Otherwise, it does nothing.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again and should still be within the bounds of `sk`.

State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged.**
