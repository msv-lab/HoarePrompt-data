To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop and understand its effects on the variables involved. Let's break down the loop and the conditions under which it executes.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each unique element `i` in `sk`, which contains unique elements from `arr`. For each unique element `i`, the following operations are performed:
1. A key `i - s` is checked in the dictionary `tk`. If the key exists, the corresponding list is updated.
2. The list associated with the key `i - s` is appended with a new tuple containing the index of the element `i` in `arr`.
3. If the length of the list associated with `i - s` exceeds 1, a check is performed to see if the elements indexed by the first two tuples in the list are different in the `jam` array. If they are different, the program prints "YES" along with the indices and exits.

### Key Observations
- The loop continues until it either finds a pair of elements that are different in the `jam` array or runs through all unique elements in `sk`.
- If the loop finds such a pair, it prints "YES" and exits, so the program terminates immediately.
- If the loop does not find any such pair, it will continue until all unique elements in `sk` have been processed.

### Output State After All Iterations
Since the loop either finds a pair and prints "YES" or processes all unique elements without finding a pair, we need to consider both scenarios.

#### Scenario 1: No Pair Found
If no such pair is found, the loop will process all unique elements in `sk`. In this case:
- `tk` will still be a dictionary where each key `i - s` maps to a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an index in `arr`.
- `jam` will remain a list containing the list `arr`.
- `flag` will remain 0.
- `ni` will remain equal to `k`.
- `s` will remain the sum of the elements in `arr`.
- `sk` will be a list of unique elements from `arr`.

#### Scenario 2: Pair Found
If a pair is found:
- The program will print "YES" and the indices of the pair.
- The program will then exit.

### Final Output State
Given the above analysis, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, and if a pair of elements is found such that `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the program prints "YES" and exits.**

This output state covers both scenarios where the loop either finds a pair and exits or processes all unique elements without finding a pair.
