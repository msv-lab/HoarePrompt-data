The code `arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. This operation changes the value of `arr` but does not affect the other variables.

The initial state includes:
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`
- `arr` remains unchanged (unchanged from its original state)
- `jam` remains unchanged
- `flag` is 0
- `ni` is an input integer
- `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`
- `l` is now `k`

After executing the code, `arr` is updated with the new list of integers obtained from the input. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `arr` is updated with the integers from the input, `jam` remains unchanged, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is now `k`**
