Let's analyze the loop and determine its final state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `k`: Input value of `raw_input()`.
- `tk`: A dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples.
- `jam`: A list containing the updated `arr` appended to it.
- `flag`: 0.
- `ni`: An integer input from the user.
- `s`: Sum of the elements in `arr`.
- `sk`: List of unique elements from `arr`.
- `l`: 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in sk:
    tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
    tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
    if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
        if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
            print('YES')
            print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
            print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
            exit(0)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The loop iterates over each unique element `i` in `sk`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if the key `i - s` exists in `tk`. If not, it initializes `tk[i - s]` as an empty list.
   - It appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to `tk[i - s]`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - After appending the tuple, it checks if the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1.
   - If this condition is met and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, it prints 'YES' and the indices and values of the two elements, and then exits the loop.

### Final State Determination:

#### Case 1: The loop executes at least once:
- The loop will continue to append tuples to `tk[i - s]` until `len(tk[i - s]) > 1`.
- Once the condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` is met and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the loop will exit, printing the required values.

#### Case 2: The loop does not execute (no match found):
- If the loop does not meet the condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` or if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] == jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` for any `i`, the loop will complete without printing anything.

### Final Output State:
- **tk**: Contains lists of tuples where each list corresponds to a key `i - s` and contains tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- **i**: Will be the last unique element `i` that was processed by the loop.
- **s**: Remains unchanged as the sum of elements in `arr` is not modified by the loop.
- **l**: Remains 0 unless the loop exits due to the condition being met, in which case it would be the last `l` value before the print statement.
- **arr**: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the `arr` list.
- **jam**: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the `jam` list.
- **flag**: Remains 0.
- **ni**: Remains the input value provided by the user.
- **sk**: Contains the list of unique elements from `arr`.

### Conclusion:
If the loop executes, it will find a pair of elements with different `jam` values and print them. If the loop does not execute, no changes occur in the variables except `i` and `l` might change depending on the loop's progression.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `l` is the last `l` value before the print statement (if the loop exits), `arr` remains unchanged, `jam` remains unchanged, `flag` is 0, `ni` is the input value provided by the user, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`.**
