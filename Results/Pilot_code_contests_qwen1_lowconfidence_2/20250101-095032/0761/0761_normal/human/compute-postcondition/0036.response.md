The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without changing any variable values. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(a, b)`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element remaining, and the program exits.**
