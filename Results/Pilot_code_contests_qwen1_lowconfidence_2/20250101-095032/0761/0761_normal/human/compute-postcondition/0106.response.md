The code prints the sum of the first two elements in `tk[i - s][0]`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]` or `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`. Since `tk[i - s][0]` is the first element of this list, it will be either `l + 1` or `l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Since `tk[i - s][0]` is a list, the print statement will take the sum of the first two elements of this list, which are both `l + 1`.

Given `l` is `k`, the sum of the first two elements will be `(k + 1) + (k + 1) = 2 * k + 2`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]` or `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`; `i` is the next unique element in `sk` (i.e., `i + 1`); `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`; `jam` is `[arr]`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`; `l` is `k`; printed output is '2 * k + 2'.**
