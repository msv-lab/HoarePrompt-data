Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
   - `tk` is an empty dictionary.
   - `jam` is an empty list.
   - `flag` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `l` from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 (since `range(k)` will generate values from 0 to `k-1`). However, since we are given that `2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, this condition is already satisfied.
   - `tk` is initially an empty dictionary, and it doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `jam` is initially an empty list, and similarly, it doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `flag` being 0 does not impact the loop execution.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `k` is at least 1, but given the constraint 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, this is already ensured.

Therefore, the required state adjustments for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `tk` is an empty dictionary; `jam` is an empty list; `flag` is 0**
