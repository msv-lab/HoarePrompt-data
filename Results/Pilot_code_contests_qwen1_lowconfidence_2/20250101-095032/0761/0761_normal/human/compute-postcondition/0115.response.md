Postcondition: ***`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. If the condition `not flag` is true (which means the loop did not find a valid pair), `tk[i - s]` contains at most one element. Otherwise, `tk[i - s]` contains more than one element. `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided by the input, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` remains 0, `ni` is the input integer, `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.***
