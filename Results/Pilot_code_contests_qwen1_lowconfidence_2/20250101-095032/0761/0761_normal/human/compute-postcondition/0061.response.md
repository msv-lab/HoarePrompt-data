The code prints the sum of 1 and the first element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]`, followed by a space, and then the second element of the same tuple. Let's break down the steps:

1. `tk[i - s]` is a list containing one tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
2. `tk[i - s][0]` is the tuple itself, which is `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
3. `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `l`.
4. `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

So, the code effectively prints `l + 1` followed by `arr.index(i) + 1`. Since `i` is `i + 1`, `arr.index(i)` would give the index of `i + 1` in `arr`, and adding 1 to it gives the index of `i` in `arr`.

Given these details, let's summarize the output state:

- `tk[i - s]` is unchanged.
- `i` is unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- The console displays the printed values, which are `l + 1` and `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, the console displays `l + 1` `arr.index(i) + 1`**
