Postcondition: ***`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[[], [1, tk[i - s][1][1], (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, and if `len(tk[i - s]) > 1`, the print statement outputs '1' followed by `tk[i - s][1][1]` and `tk[i - s][1][2]` if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. Otherwise, no changes occur to these variables.***
