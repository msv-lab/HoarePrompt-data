Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]` or remains as `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`.
- `i` is the next unique element in `sk`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.
- `jam` is `[arr]`.
- `flag` is 0.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`.
- `l` is `k`.
- The printed values are `str(l + 1)` and `str(arr.index(i) + 2)` if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. Otherwise, the original state of `tk[i - s]` is retained.

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop iterates over each unique element `i` in the list `sk`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute again if there are more unique elements in `sk` to iterate over.
2. **Current State**: After the previous iteration, `i` is set to the next unique element in `sk`.
3. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - The loop will execute again if `sk` still contains at least one more unique element.
   - Therefore, the next unique element `i` will be the current `i` value plus 1 (since it's iterating through `sk`).

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration
- `tk[i - s]` will remain as it is because the loop body did not modify it and the condition for its modification is based on specific printed values which are only evaluated within the loop.
- `i` will be the next unique element in `sk`, which means it will be the current `i` value plus 1.
- `s` remains the same as it is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr` and not modified by the loop.
- `jam` remains as `[arr]` since no modification was made.
- `flag` remains 0 unless the loop body changes it, but we don't have information about that.
- `ni` remains unchanged.
- `sk` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it, but we don't have information about that.
- `l` remains `k`.

### Final State Adjustment
Given the analysis, the states need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `i` should be the next unique element in `sk`, which is `i + 1`.
- `tk[i - s]` remains as it is unless the loop body changes it, but we assume it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]` or remains as `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. `i` is the next unique element in `sk` (i.e., `i + 1`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, and the printed values are `str(l + 1)` and `str(arr.index(i + 1) + 2)` if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. Otherwise, the original state of `tk[i - s]` is retained.**
