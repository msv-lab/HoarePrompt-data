The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately with a status code of 0. This means that no further code will be executed after this line. Since the program terminates, all variables remain in their current state before the `exit(0)` call.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with a key `i - s` mapping to a list `[tk[i - s][0], [tk[i - s][1][0] + 1, tk[i - s][1][1]]]`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element, the print statement outputs 'YES', `tk[i - s][0][0]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is included in the output state, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `tk[i - s][1][1]`.**
