The code `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list associated with the key `i - s` in the dictionary `tk`.

- `tk[i - s]` is a list that currently contains tuples of the form `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- `l` is now `k`, which means `l` has the value of `k`.
- `arr.index(i) + 1` gives the index of `i` in the list `arr`, plus one.

Given these points, the tuple `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)` will be appended to the list `tk[i - s]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.
- `jam` is now `[arr]`, with the new list appended.
- `flag` is 0.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`.
- `l` is `k`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`tk[i - s]` includes the additional tuple `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is now `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.**
