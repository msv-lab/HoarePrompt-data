The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Given the initial state:

- `tk[i - s]` is now `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`
- `i` is the next unique element in `sk`
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`
- `jam` is `[arr]`
- `flag` is 0
- `ni` is an input integer
- `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`
- `l` is `k`
- The length of `tk[i - s]` is 1

Since `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, the expression `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `l` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Thus, the printed values are `str(l + 1)` and `str(arr.index(i) + 1)`. 

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`, `i` is the next unique element in `sk`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, the printed values are `str(l + 1)` and `str(arr.index(i) + 1)`**
