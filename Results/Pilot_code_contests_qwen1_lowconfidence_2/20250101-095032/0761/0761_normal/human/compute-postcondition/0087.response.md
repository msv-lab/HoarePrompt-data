The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. However, this does not change any of the variables' values. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the output to the console, but since we are focusing on the variables' states, no variables are updated.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` includes the additional tuple `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `i` is the last unique element that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is now `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, and the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1. Additionally, the first element of `jam` is not equal to the second element of `jam`. Printed output: YES**
