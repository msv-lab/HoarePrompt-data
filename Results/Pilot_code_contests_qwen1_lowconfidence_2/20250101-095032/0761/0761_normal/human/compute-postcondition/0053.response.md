The code snippet prints the string formed by concatenating the second element of the second tuple in `tk[i - s]` with its index plus one, followed by a space, and then the first element of the second tuple in `tk[i - s]`. This does not modify any variables but changes the state by printing to the console.

Given the initial state:
- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing tuples, with the length of `tk[i - s]` being greater than 1.
- The value of `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`.
- The console displays 'YES'.
- The console also displays the string `str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1])`.

After running the provided code snippet, the console will additionally display the string `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`.

Output State: **`tk`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` remain unchanged; the console displays 'YES' and the string `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`**.
