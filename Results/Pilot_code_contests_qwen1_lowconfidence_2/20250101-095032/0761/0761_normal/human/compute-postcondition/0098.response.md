Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`, `i` is the next unique element in `sk`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, the printed values are `str(l + 1)` and `str(arr.index(i) + 2)**

Explanation: The code prints `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is initially `[l, arr.index(i) + 1]`. After executing the print statement, `tk[i - s]` is updated to `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]` because the first element (which is `l`) is incremented by 1, and the second element (which is `arr.index(i) + 1`) is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
