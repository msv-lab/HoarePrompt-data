Let's analyze the loop step-by-step and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations.

### Initial State:
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`
- `arr` is updated with the integers from the input
- `jam` is now `[arr]`, with the new list appended
- `flag` is 0
- `ni` is an input integer
- `sk` is the list of unique elements from `arr`
- `l` is now `k`
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in sk:
    tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
    tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
    if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
        if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
            print('YES')
            print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
            print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
            exit(0)
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `tk[i - s]` includes the tuple `(k + 1, arr.index(i) + 1)` as its first element.
   - `tk[i - s]` is updated with `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
   - If `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the loop prints the indices and exits.

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each unique element `i` in `sk`, the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` is appended to `tk[i - s]`.
   - If `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the loop prints the indices and exits.

3. **Final State After Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues to append tuples to `tk[i - s]` until it finds a pair of indices that satisfy the condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`.
   - If such a pair is found, the loop prints the indices and exits, leaving `tk[i - s]` with more than one element.
   - If no such pair is found, the loop exits without printing anything, and `tk[i - s]` may contain only one element or multiple elements.

### Final Output State:
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.
- `arr` is updated with the integers from the input.
- `jam` is `[arr]`, with the new list appended.
- `flag` is 0.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.
- `l` is `k`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.

If the loop exits without finding a valid pair:
- `tk[i - s]` contains at most one element.

If the loop exits after finding a valid pair:
- `tk[i - s]` contains more than one element, where the first two elements are the valid pair.

### Conclusion:
**Output State:**
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.
- `arr` is updated with the integers from the input.
- `jam` is `[arr]`, with the new list appended.
- `flag` is 0.
- `ni` is an input integer.
- `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.
- `l` is `k`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`.
- `tk[i - s]` contains tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` for each unique element `i` in `sk` up to the point where a valid pair is found, or it contains only one element if no valid pair is found.
