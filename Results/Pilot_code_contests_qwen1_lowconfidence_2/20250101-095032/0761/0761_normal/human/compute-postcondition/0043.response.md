`jam.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `jam`. The value of `arr` is not specified in the initial state, but since it is being appended to `jam`, it means `arr` remains unchanged in its form but is now part of the `jam` list. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples, `jam` is a list containing the updated `arr` appended to it, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an integer input from the user, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is 0**
