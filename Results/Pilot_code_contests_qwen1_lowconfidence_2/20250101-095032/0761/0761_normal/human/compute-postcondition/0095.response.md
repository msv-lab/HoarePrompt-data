`tk[i - s]` is appended with the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. Since `tk[i - s]` was initially an empty list, after appending, it will contain this single tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is now [(l, arr.index(i) + 1)], `i` is the next unique element in `sk`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, and the length of `tk[i - s]` is 1.**
