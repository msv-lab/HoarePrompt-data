The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2, (l, arr.index(i) + 1)]` or `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]`; `i` is the next unique element in `sk` (i.e., `i + 1`); `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`; `jam` is `[arr]`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`; `l` is `k`. Printed output: 'YES'**
