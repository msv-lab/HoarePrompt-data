The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it works with sequences of integers that are defined within the function's scope. Specifically, there are `k` sequences, where `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). For each `i` from 1 to `k`, `n_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n_i < 2 \cdot 10^5\), and each sequence consists of `n_i` integers ranging from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\). The total length of all sequences combined does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function returns a value based on some unspecified logic applied to these sequences. Since no specific output cases are provided, we can only describe the input constraints and the nature of the returned value.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates on `k` sequences of integers, where `k` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and each sequence has a length between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\). The function returns a value based on the sequences.**
