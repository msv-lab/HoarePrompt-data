The code initializes an empty list `jam`. The value of `k` is taken from the input using `raw_input()` and is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive. Since no operations are performed on `k` or `tk`, their values remain unchanged. The only new variable `jam` is created and is initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `tk` is an empty dictionary; `jam` is an empty list**
