The `exit(0)` function call terminates the program immediately without further execution of the remaining code. Therefore, no changes are made to any variables, and the initial state remains intact.

Output State: **`tk`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `arr` remain unchanged; the console displays 'YES' and the string `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`**
