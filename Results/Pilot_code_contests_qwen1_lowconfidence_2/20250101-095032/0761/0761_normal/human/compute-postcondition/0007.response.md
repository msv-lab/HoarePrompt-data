`jam.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `jam`. Since `arr` is a list of integers obtained from user input, it is not specified what the exact contents of `arr` are, but it is added to `jam`. The value of `k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` remains an empty dictionary, `flag` remains 0, and `ni` remains equal to `k`.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`**
