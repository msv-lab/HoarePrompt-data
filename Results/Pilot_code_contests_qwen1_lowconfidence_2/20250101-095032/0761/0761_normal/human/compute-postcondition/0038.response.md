Postcondition: ***`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(a, b)`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element remaining. If `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` and `jam[a]` is not equal to `jam[b]`, the program exits. Otherwise, no change occurs in the program state.***
