The code prints the value of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` followed by a space, and then the value of `tk[i - s][0][1]`. The variables `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `s`, and `sk` are not affected by this print statement. The value of `k` might change because `k` was used to initialize `ni`, but since no operations are performed on `k` itself, it remains the same as its initial value.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is the input value of `raw_input()`
- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`
- `flag` is 0
- `ni` is equal to `k`
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`
- `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element remaining
- A print statement outputs 'YES'

The output of the print statement is derived from `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Let's denote `tk[i - s][0][0]` as `a` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` as `b`. The output will be `str(a + 1) + ' ' + str(b)`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, they remain as they are in the initial state, except they are referenced in the print statement. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(a, b)`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is equal to `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` that must contain at least one unique element remaining, and the print statement outputs 'YES', where `a` is `tk[i - s][0][0]` and `b` is `tk[i - s][0][1]`.**
