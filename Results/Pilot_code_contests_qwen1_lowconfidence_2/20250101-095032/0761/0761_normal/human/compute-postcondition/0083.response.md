The code snippet `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` checks if the key `i - s` exists in the dictionary `tk`. If it does, the value remains unchanged. If it doesn't, the key `i - s` is added to the dictionary with an empty list as its value.

Given the initial state:
- `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`
- `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`
- `arr` is updated with the integers from the input
- `jam` is now `[arr]`, with the new list appended
- `flag` is 0
- `ni` is an input integer
- `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`
- `l` is now `k`
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`

Since the code snippet only updates the dictionary `tk` and does not affect the values of the other variables, the output state will include the new entry in the dictionary `tk` for the key `i - s`.

Output State: **`tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the new entry `i - s` maps to an empty list, `i` is the last unique element `i` that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `arr` is updated with the integers from the input, `jam` is now `[arr]`, with the new list appended, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is now `k`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`**
