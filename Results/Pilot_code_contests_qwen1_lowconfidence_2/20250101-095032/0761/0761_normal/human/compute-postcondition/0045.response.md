The code `sk = list(set(arr))` creates a list of unique elements from `arr` and assigns it to `sk`. Since `arr` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact content, but we know that `sk` will contain all unique elements from `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is a dictionary with keys `i - s` mapping to lists of tuples, `jam` is a list containing the updated `arr` appended to it, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an integer input from the user, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is 0**
