The `exit(0)` function call terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that no further changes are made to the variables. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` includes the tuple `(k + 1, arr.index(i) + 1)` as its first element, `i` is the last unique element that was processed, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, and the first element of `jam` is not equal to the second element of `jam`.**
