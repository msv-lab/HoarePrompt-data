Postcondition: ***`tk[i - s]` is now either `[l + 1, arr.index(i) + 2]` or remains as `[(l, arr.index(i) + 1)]`. `i` is the next unique element in `sk`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the updated `arr`, `jam` is `[arr]`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `sk` is a non-empty list of unique elements from `arr`, `l` is `k`, and the printed values are `str(l + 1)` and `str(arr.index(i) + 2)` if the condition `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` is true. Otherwise, the original state of `tk[i - s]` is retained.***
