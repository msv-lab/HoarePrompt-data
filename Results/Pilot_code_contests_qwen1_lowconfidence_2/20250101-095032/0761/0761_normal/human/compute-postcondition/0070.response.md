The code prints the value of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` followed by the value of `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Given the initial state:

- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `s` remains unchanged
- `l` remains unchanged
- `arr` remains unchanged

We can deduce that `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `l` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i + 2) + 1`.

So, the code essentially prints `str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`.

Since no other variables are modified, the output state includes the updated values of `i` and the printed statement:

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, printed statement is 'YES' and the output is `str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(arr.index(i + 2) + 1)`**
