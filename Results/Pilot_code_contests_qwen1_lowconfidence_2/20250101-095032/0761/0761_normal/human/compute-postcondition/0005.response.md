`ni` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which converts the input from the user into an integer. The variable `k` is initially set to the input value of `raw_input()`, so `ni` will have the same value as `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, and `ni` is equal to `k`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to the input value of `raw_input()`, `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, and `ni` is equal to `k`.**
