k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each sequence is represented by two lines: the first line contains an integer n_i (1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the i-th sequence, and the second line contains n_i integers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, n_i} — the elements of the i-th sequence. The elements of sequences are integer numbers from -10^4 to 10^4. The sum of lengths of all given sequences does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, i.e. n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
