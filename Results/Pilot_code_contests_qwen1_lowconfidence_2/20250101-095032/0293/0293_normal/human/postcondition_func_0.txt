The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the length of the list `b`, and `b`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains information about the connections of a bulb. The function iterates through the elements of `a` and `b`, calculating the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`. The function returns this sum. 

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `c` holds the computed sum, which is returned as the output of the function. There are no side effects on the input parameters `a` and `b`, and the function does not modify them.
