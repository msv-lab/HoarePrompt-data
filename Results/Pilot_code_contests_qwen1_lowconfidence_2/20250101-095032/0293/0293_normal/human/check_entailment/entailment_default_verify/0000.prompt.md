You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 10
* 1 \leq k_i \leq N
* 1 \leq s_{ij} \leq N
* s_{ia} \neq s_{ib} (a \neq b)
* p_i is 0 or 1.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
k_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}
:
k_M s_{M1} s_{M2} ... s_{Mk_M}
p_1 p_2 ... p_M


Output

Print the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it checks the condition for each bulb. Specifically, the function `func_1` computes the dot product of the switch state vector `p` and the switch state vector `s`, which gives the number of switches that are "on" and connected to the bulb. However, the condition `if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r]:` should check if the number of "on" switches connected to the bulb is congruent to `p[r]` modulo 2.

The correct condition should be `if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r] ^ 1:` because the bulb should be lit if the parity (even or odd) of the number of "on" switches matches `p[r]`. The current implementation does not account for this and always checks if the parity matches `pm[r]`, which is incorrect.

Here is an example where the program fails:
For the input:
```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
0 1
```
The expected output is 1, but the program outputs 0 because it incorrectly counts the number of valid configurations.

To fix this, the condition in `func_1` should be changed to:
```python
if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r] ^ 1:
```

This ensures that the number of "on" switches connected to each bulb is checked correctly against the required parity condition.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the length of the list `b`, and `b`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains information about the connections of a bulb. The function iterates through the elements of `a` and `b`, calculating the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`. The function returns this sum. 

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `c` holds the computed sum, which is returned as the output of the function. There are no side effects on the input parameters `a` and `b`, and the function does not modify them.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
