Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it checks the condition for each bulb. Specifically, the function `func_1` computes the dot product of the switch state vector `p` and the switch state vector `s`, which gives the number of switches that are "on" and connected to the bulb. However, the condition `if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r]:` should check if the number of "on" switches connected to the bulb is congruent to `p[r]` modulo 2.

The correct condition should be `if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r] ^ 1:` because the bulb should be lit if the parity (even or odd) of the number of "on" switches matches `p[r]`. The current implementation does not account for this and always checks if the parity matches `pm[r]`, which is incorrect.

Here is an example where the program fails:
For the input:
```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
0 1
```
The expected output is 1, but the program outputs 0 because it incorrectly counts the number of valid configurations.

To fix this, the condition in `func_1` should be changed to:
```python
if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r] ^ 1:
```

This ensures that the number of "on" switches connected to each bulb is checked correctly against the required parity condition.
