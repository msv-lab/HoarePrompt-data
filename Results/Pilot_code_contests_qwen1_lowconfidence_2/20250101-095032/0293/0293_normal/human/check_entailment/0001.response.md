Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function, which is used to calculate the dot product of two lists. The function should return the sum of the products of corresponding elements, but it instead returns the sum of the elements after adding them together. This will result in incorrect calculations for the parity condition required to light the bulbs.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
0 1
```

- Bulb 1 is connected to switches 1 and 2. It lights up when the number of "on" switches among these is even (0 or 2).
- Bulb 2 is connected to switch 2. It lights up when the number of "on" switches among these is even (0).

The correct answer should be 1, as there is only one combination that satisfies both conditions: having switch 2 "on" and switch 1 "off".

However, due to the error in `func_1`, the program may not correctly compute the dot product, leading to incorrect results. For instance, if switch 1 is "on" and switch 2 is "off", the program might incorrectly determine that this combination does not satisfy the conditions for both bulbs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
