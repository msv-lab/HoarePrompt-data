Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` takes two parameters, but the first parameter `a` is an integer instead of a list. The function should take two lists as parameters to calculate the sum of the products of corresponding elements, but due to the incorrect type of the first parameter, the function cannot operate as intended.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` should be an integer (length of `b`) and `b` should be a list. However, the function should actually take two lists as parameters to perform the calculation correctly.

2. The main part of the code iterates over all possible switch configurations (`slist`), checks if the configuration satisfies the conditions for each bulb using `func_1`, and updates `slist` accordingly. However, `func_1` is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Given the constraints and problem description, the correct implementation should involve checking each switch configuration against the conditions for each bulb using a proper binary representation of switch states. Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1` and the overall logic:

```python
from itertools import product

(N, M) = map(int, input().split())
connections = [set() for _ in range(M)]
for i in range(M):
    k, *switches = map(int, input().split())
    connections[i] = set(switches)

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Generate all possible switch configurations
all_configs = list(product([0, 1], repeat=N))

valid_configs = []

for config in all_configs:
    if all((sum(config[s-1] for s in switches) % 2 == p[i]) for i, switches in enumerate(connections)):
        valid_configs.append(config)

print(len(valid_configs))
```

This corrected code properly generates all possible switch configurations and checks each configuration against the conditions for each bulb, ensuring that the logic matches the problem description.
