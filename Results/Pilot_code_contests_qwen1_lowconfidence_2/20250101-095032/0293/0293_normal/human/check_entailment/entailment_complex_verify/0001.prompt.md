You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 10
* 1 \leq k_i \leq N
* 1 \leq s_{ij} \leq N
* s_{ia} \neq s_{ib} (a \neq b)
* p_i is 0 or 1.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function, which is used to calculate the dot product of two lists. The function should return the sum of the products of corresponding elements, but it instead returns the sum of the elements after adding them together. This will result in incorrect calculations for the parity condition required to light the bulbs.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
2 1 2
1 2
0 1
```

- Bulb 1 is connected to switches 1 and 2. It lights up when the number of "on" switches among these is even (0 or 2).
- Bulb 2 is connected to switch 2. It lights up when the number of "on" switches among these is even (0).

The correct answer should be 1, as there is only one combination that satisfies both conditions: having switch 2 "on" and switch 1 "off".

However, due to the error in `func_1`, the program may not correctly compute the dot product, leading to incorrect results. For instance, if switch 1 is "on" and switch 2 is "off", the program might incorrectly determine that this combination does not satisfy the conditions for both bulbs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
ks = []
for i in range(M):
    ks2 = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ks.append(ks2)
pm = map(int, raw_input().split())
plist = []
for i in ks:
    t = [0] * N
    ini = 1
    for j in i:
        if ini == 1:
            ini = 0
            continue
        else:
            t[j - 1] = 1
    plist.append(t)
slist = []
for i in range(2 ** N):
    t = []
    for j in range(N):
        t.append(i % 2)
        i = i / 2
    slist.append(t)
r = 0
for p in plist:
    s2 = []
    for s in slist:
        if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r]:
            s2.append(s)
    r = r + 1
    slist = s2
print(len(slist))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of switches (N), and b is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the connections of each bulb (k_i, s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., s_{ik_i}), and the last element of the list is a list of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_M) representing the modulo condition for each bulb.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of a[i] * b[i] for all i from 0 to len(a) - 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the length of the list `b`, and `b`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains information about the connections of a bulb. The function iterates through the elements of `a` and `b`, calculating the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`. The function returns this sum. 

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `c` holds the computed sum, which is returned as the output of the function. There are no side effects on the input parameters `a` and `b`, and the function does not modify them.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
