You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 10
* 1 \leq k_i \leq N
* 1 \leq s_{ij} \leq N
* s_{ia} \neq s_{ib} (a \neq b)
* p_i is 0 or 1.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
k_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}
:
k_M s_{M1} s_{M2} ... s_{Mk_M}
p_1 p_2 ... p_M


Output

Print the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
ks = []
for i in range(M):
    ks2 = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ks.append(ks2)
pm = map(int, raw_input().split())
plist = []
for i in ks:
    t = [0] * N
    ini = 1
    for j in i:
        if ini == 1:
            ini = 0
            continue
        else:
            t[j - 1] = 1
    plist.append(t)
slist = []
for i in range(2 ** N):
    t = []
    for j in range(N):
        t.append(i % 2)
        i = i / 2
    slist.append(t)
r = 0
for p in plist:
    s2 = []
    for s in slist:
        if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r]:
            s2.append(s)
    r = r + 1
    slist = s2
print(len(slist))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of switches (N), and b is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the connections of each bulb (k_i, s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., s_{ik_i}), and the last element of the list is a list of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_M) representing the modulo condition for each bulb.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of a[i] * b[i] for all i from 0 to len(a) - 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the length of the list `b`, and `b`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains information about the connections of a bulb. The function iterates through the elements of `a` and `b`, calculating the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`. The function returns this sum. 

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `c` holds the computed sum, which is returned as the output of the function. There are no side effects on the input parameters `a` and `b`, and the function does not modify them.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
