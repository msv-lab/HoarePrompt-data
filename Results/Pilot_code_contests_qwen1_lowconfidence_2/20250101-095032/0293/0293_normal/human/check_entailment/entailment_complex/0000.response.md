Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of switches \( N \) and bulbs \( M \).
   - It then reads the connections for each bulb, storing them in the list `ks`.
   - Finally, it reads the modulo conditions for each bulb and stores them in the list `pm`.

2. **Constructing the Switch States**:
   - The program generates all possible switch states. Since there are \( N \) switches, there are \( 2^N \) possible combinations of states. Each combination is stored in the list `slist`.

3. **Checking Bulb Conditions**:
   - For each possible switch state, the program checks whether it satisfies the conditions for lighting all the bulbs.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the products of the switch states and the connections for each bulb.
   - If the sum is congruent to the corresponding modulo condition (`pm[r]`), the switch state is considered valid for that bulb.

4. **Filtering Valid Switch States**:
   - The program iterates over all switch states and filters out those that do not satisfy the conditions for all bulbs.
   - The final list `slist` contains only the switch states that light all the bulbs.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of valid switch states, which is the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.

The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem statement:
- It reads the necessary inputs.
- It generates all possible switch states.
- It checks each state against the conditions for all bulbs.
- It filters out invalid states and counts the valid ones.

Therefore, the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description, making it correct.
