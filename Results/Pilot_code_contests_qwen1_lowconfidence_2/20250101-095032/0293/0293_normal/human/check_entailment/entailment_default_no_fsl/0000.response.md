Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not work correctly for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `a`, which is an integer, and `b`, which is a list. However, in the program, `func_1` is called with two lists as arguments, which is inconsistent with its definition. This inconsistency leads to incorrect behavior.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be updated to accept two lists as parameters instead of an integer and a list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
    return c
```

With this correction, the program should correctly compute the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs for every potential case.
