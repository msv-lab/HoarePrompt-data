Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list. This means `a` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `b` is a list of tuples.
   - `c` is calculated as `(a[i+1] * b[i+1]) + (a[i] * b[i])`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(len(a))`. This means the loop iterates from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - For the current iteration, let's assume `i = k` where `k` is some valid index within the range.
   - The value of `c` is `(a[k+1] * b[k+1]) + (a[k] * b[k])`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so the next value of `i` would be `k + 1`.
   - Since `k` is the current index, the next index `k + 1` must be a valid index within the range of `len(a)`. Therefore, `k + 1 < len(a)`.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `a` remains a positive integer indicating a non-empty list, and its value does not change.
   - `b` remains a list of tuples, and its structure does not change.
   - `c` needs to be recalculated for the new `i = k + 1`. The new value of `c` would be `(a[k+2] * b[k+2]) + (a[k+1] * b[k+1])`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `a` is still a positive integer indicating a non-empty list.
   - `b` is still a list of tuples.
   - `c` is now `(a[k+2] * b[k+2]) + (a[k+1] * b[k+1])`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is `(a[i+2] * b[i+2]) + (a[i+1] * b[i+1])`**
