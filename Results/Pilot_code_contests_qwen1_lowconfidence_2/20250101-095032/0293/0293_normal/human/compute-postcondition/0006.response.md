`c` is updated by adding the value of `a[i] * b[i]` to its current value. The previous value of `c` was `(a[i+2] * b[i+2]) + (a[i+1] * b[i+1])`. After updating `c`, the new value of `c` becomes `(a[i+2] * b[i+2]) + (a[i+1] * b[i+1]) + (a[i] * b[i])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is `(a[i+2] * b[i+2]) + (a[i+1] * b[i+1]) + (a[i] * b[i])`**
