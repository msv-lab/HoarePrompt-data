The code `c += a[i] * b[i]` updates the value of `c` by adding `a[i] * b[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state where `c` is `a[i+1] * b[i+1]`, the new value of `c` will be the sum of `a[i+1] * b[i+1]` and `a[i] * b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is `(a[i+1] * b[i+1]) + (a[i] * b[i])`**
