The code `c += a[i] * b[i]` updates the value of `c` by adding `a[i] * b[i]` to its current value. Here, `a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list, so `i` is an index within the range of `a`. However, since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can only express `c` in terms of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

The initial state is:
- `a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list.
- `b` is a list of tuples.
- `c` is 0.

After executing the code, `c` is updated to `c + a[i] * b[i]`. Since `c` was initially 0, the new value of `c` is `a[i] * b[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer indicating a non-empty list; `b` is a list of tuples; `c` is `a[i] * b[i]`.**
