The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is an integer representing the number of switches (N), and `b`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `b` represents the connections of each bulb (k_i, s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., s_{ik_i}), and the last element of the list `b` is a list of integers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_M) representing the modulo condition for each bulb.

After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `a` and a list of tuples `b`, and return the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a` (an integer) and a parameter `b` (a list of tuples). It returns the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.**
