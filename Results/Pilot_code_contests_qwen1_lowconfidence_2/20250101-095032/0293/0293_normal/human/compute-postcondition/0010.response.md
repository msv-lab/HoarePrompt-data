Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the length of the list `b`, and `b`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains information about the connections of a bulb. The function iterates through the elements of `a` and `b`, calculating the sum of `a[i] * b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`. The function returns this sum. 

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `c` holds the computed sum, which is returned as the output of the function. There are no side effects on the input parameters `a` and `b`, and the function does not modify them.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `a` is an empty list, the function will return 0 because the loop will not execute, and `c` will remain 0.
- If `b` is an empty list, the function will also return 0 for the same reason as above.
- The code assumes that `a` and `b` have the same length. If `a` and `b` do not have the same length, the code will still execute without error, but the behavior might not be as expected, as the loop will only run up to the minimum length of `a` and `b`.**
