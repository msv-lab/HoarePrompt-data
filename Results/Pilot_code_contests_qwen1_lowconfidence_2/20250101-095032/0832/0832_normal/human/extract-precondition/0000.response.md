Precondition: **There is no direct relationship or variable description within the provided function `func_1` that relates to the problem description. The function does not contain any variables or logic related to checking subsequences or sums being divisible by a number.** 

The function `func_1` is modifying the behavior of standard Python I/O operations like `input` and `flush`. It seems to be part of a larger program that deals with input/output management, but it does not contribute to solving the described problem.
