Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the condition \( j - i \neq k - j \), which is a crucial part of the problem statement. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the input string `S` might lack one or more of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Condition Check**: The code does not properly enforce the condition \( j - i \neq k - j \). It checks for the presence of different characters but does not ensure that the indices satisfy the distance condition.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle strings that lack one or more of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. For example, if the string `S` consists only of 'R' or 'G' or 'B', the current implementation would still attempt to perform operations that are not meaningful.

3. **Output**: The function directly prints the result without returning it, which might be a limitation depending on the intended use.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
