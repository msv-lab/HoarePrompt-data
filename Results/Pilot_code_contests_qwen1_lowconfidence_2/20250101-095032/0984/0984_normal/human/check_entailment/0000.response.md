Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem but fails to handle the condition \( j - i \neq k - j \) correctly. Specifically, the program does not properly filter out the invalid triples where \( j - i = k - j \).

Let's consider an example string `RRGB`:
- The valid triple is `(1, 2, 3)` because \( R \neq G \neq B \) and \( 2 - 1 \neq 3 - 2 \).
- However, the program will also count the triple `(1, 3, 5)` which is invalid because it would imply \( R \neq R \neq B \) and \( 3 - 1 = 5 - 3 \), which is not true.

The program needs to ensure that for each pair \((i, j)\), the value of \(k\) is chosen such that \(j - i \neq k - j\). The current implementation does not check this condition, leading to incorrect results.
