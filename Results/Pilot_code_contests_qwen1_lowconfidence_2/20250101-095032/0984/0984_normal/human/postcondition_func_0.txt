- The function does not check if the input string `S` contains any characters other than 'R', 'G', and 'B'. While this is implied by the problem statement, it is not explicitly verified in the code.
- The function assumes that `S` always contains at least one occurrence of each character 'R', 'G', and 'B'. This is not guaranteed by the problem statement, and the function should handle cases where `S` might lack one or more of these characters.
- The function does not return a value; instead, it directly prints the result. Depending on the intended use, this could be a limitation, as the caller cannot easily capture the result for further processing.
