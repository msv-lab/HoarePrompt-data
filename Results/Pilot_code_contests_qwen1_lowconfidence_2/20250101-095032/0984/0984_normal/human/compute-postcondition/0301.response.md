Postcondition: ***`len(r)` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `len(r) - 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the value found by `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is updated by either `z + (q1 - to - 1)` if `q[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, or `z + (q1 - to)` otherwise.***
