The code snippet `p1 = len(p)` calculates the length of the list `p` and assigns it to the variable `p1`. The list `p` contains the indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s`. Since `p` is a list of indices, `len(p)` gives the count of times 'R' appears in `s`.

The output state will include the updated value of `p1` and will also maintain the original values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is a list containing all indices of that character in `s`; `i` is the last index of `s`; `p` is a list of indices where the character 'R' appears in `s`; `q` is the list of indices where the character 'G' appears in `s`; `r` is the list of indices where the character 'B' appears in `s`; `p1` is the length of the list `p`**.
