Let's break down the code and the possible exceptions step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`.
   - `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order.
   - `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted.
   - `z` is some variable (not initialized here, but we assume it starts with a certain value).

2. **Code Execution in `try` Block:**
   - The code checks if `r[to:][isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is increased by `r1 - to - 1`.
   - If the condition is false, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.

3. **Exception Handling in `except` Block:**
   - If any exception other than `FileNotFoundError` or `PermissionError` occurs (which were not defined in the given context), the `except` block catches it and updates `z` to its previous value plus `r1 - to`.

### Possible Exceptions
- The exception could be raised if `r[to:][isTrue]` is accessed and `r[to:]` is empty, or if `isTrue` is out of bounds, etc.

### Summary of the Try Except Statement

- The `try` block checks if a specific condition is met and updates `z` accordingly.
- The `except` block ensures that `z` is updated even if an unexpected exception occurs, maintaining a consistent behavior.

### Final Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted, and `z` is increased by either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to`, depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false. If an exception occurs, `z` is updated to its previous value plus `r1 - to`.**

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted, and `z` is increased by either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to`, depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false. If an exception occurs, `z` is updated to its previous value plus `r1 - to`.**
