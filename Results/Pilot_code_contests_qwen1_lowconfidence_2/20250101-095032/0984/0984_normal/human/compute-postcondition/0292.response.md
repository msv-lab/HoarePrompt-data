Postcondition: ***`len(r)` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `len(r) - 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is either increased by `q1 - to - 1` or `z + (q1 - to)`, depending on whether `q[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]` or not.***
