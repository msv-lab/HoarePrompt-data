Postcondition: ***`l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`; `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into `p` to maintain the sorted order; `z` is incremented by either `p1 - to - 1` or `p1 - to` depending on whether `p[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`; `q` remains unchanged; `r` remains the same list after all iterations; `isTrue` is the index of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `p[to:]` or the length of `p[to:]` if `2 * l[1] - l[0]` is not found.***
