Postcondition: **`l` contains `[q[i], r[j+1]]` sorted, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `to` is the index where `r[j+1]` would be inserted into `p` to maintain it in sorted order, `isTrue` is assigned the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[j+1] - q[i])`, and `z` is updated to `z + max(0, p1 - to - 1)`**.
