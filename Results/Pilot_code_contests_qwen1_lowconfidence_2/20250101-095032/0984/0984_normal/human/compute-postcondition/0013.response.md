The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` is executed. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 1. Therefore, `s[1]` (the second character in the string `s`) is accessed and its corresponding list in the dictionary `d` is updated by appending `i` to it.

Let's break it down:

- Initially, `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list, except for the key `s[0]` which has the value `[0]`.
- `i` is set to 1.

After executing `d[s[i]].append(i)`:

- The key in the dictionary `d` is `s[1]`.
- The value associated with this key is an empty list initially, unless `s[1]` was already a key before, in which case its value would be the list it currently holds.
- The value `[i]` is appended to this list.

Since the initial value of `d[s[0]]` is `[0]`, and no other information is given about the content of `d` for other keys, we only focus on the change made to `d[s[1]]`.

Therefore, the updated dictionary `d` will have `d[s[0]] = [0]` and `d[s[1]] = [1]` (if `s[1]` was not a key before, it will now have `[1]`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list, except for the key `s[0]` which has the value `[0]` and the key `s[1]` which has the value `[1]`; `i` is 2**
