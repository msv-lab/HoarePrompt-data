`z` is incremented by `r1 - to`. The value of `r1` and `to` are known, so we can directly compute the new value of `z`. However, since the specific values of `r1` and `to` are not given, we will keep them as symbols.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j + 1]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in list `r` using binary search, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is `z + r1 - to`.**
