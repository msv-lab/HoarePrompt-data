`z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`. The values of `r1`, `to`, and `r` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unknown. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j + 1]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in list `r` using binary search, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is increased by `r1 - to - 1`.**
