To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given for loop and the conditions:

Given for loop:
```python
for j in range(len(r)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = len(r) - 1`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to know the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_prev`.

3. **Determining the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the valid range of the loop, i.e., `0 <= j < len(r)`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` is `j_prev`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be `j_prev + 1`.

4. **Condition for Continuing the Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j_prev + 1 < len(r)`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `j` should be set to `j_prev + 1`.
   - The condition `len(r)` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:

State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`, `len(r)` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`**

This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `len(r)` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.
