Postcondition: ***`j` is `k + 1`, `r` must have at least `k + 2` elements, `l` is `[p[i], r[j]]` sorted, `to` is the index where `r[j]` should be inserted in `q` to keep `q` sorted, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[j] - p[i])`. If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to - 1)`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.***
