Postcondition: ***`r` must have at least one element; `q` is a sorted list; `l` is a sorted list containing the elements `[p[i], r[j]]`; `to` is the index at which `r[j]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain sorted order; `isTrue` is the index at which the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain sorted order. The value at `q[to + isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.***
