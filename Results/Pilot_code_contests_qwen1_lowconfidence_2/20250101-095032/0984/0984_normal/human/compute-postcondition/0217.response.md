Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [p[0], r[0]] sorted, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into `q` to maintain order, `isTrue` is updated to the value of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is the sum of all valid increments, `r` must have at least one element, and the current value of `q[to:][isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`***
