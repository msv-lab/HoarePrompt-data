`z` is incremented by the value of `p1 - to`. Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot determine the specific values of `z`, `p1`, and `to`, but we know that `z` has been updated to `z + (p1 - to)`. 

Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + (p1 - to)`, `p1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
