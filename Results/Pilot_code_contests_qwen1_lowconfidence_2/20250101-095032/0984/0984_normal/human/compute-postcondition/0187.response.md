Postcondition: **`len(r)` is at least 1, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains the same list after all iterations, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in `p` (or the insertion point if `l[1]` is not present), `isTrue` is not the index of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `p[to:]`, `z` is unchanged, and `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`.**
