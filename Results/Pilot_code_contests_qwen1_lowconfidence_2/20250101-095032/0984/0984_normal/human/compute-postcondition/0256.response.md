`l` is assigned the sorted list of `[p[i], r[j]]`. The value of `j` is updated to `j_prev + 1`, and `r[j]` is accessed. Since `j` was previously `j_prev + 1`, now `j` is `j_prev + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `j_prev + 2`; `len(r)` must be greater than `j_prev + 2`; `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is `j_prev + 2`; `len(r)` must be greater than `j_prev + 2`; `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`**.
