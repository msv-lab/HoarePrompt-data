The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This means that `d` is now an empty dictionary, while the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is an empty dictionary**
