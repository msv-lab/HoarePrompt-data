`z` is incremented by the value of `q1 - to`. Since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, we cannot specify their exact values in the output state. However, we can express the updated value of `z` in terms of the original values.

Output State: **`z` is increased by `q1 - to`, `q1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
