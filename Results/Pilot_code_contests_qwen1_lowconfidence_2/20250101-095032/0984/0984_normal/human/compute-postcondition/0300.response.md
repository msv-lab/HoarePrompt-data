`z` is incremented by `q1 - to`. The value of `q1 - to` is added to the current value of `z`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(r)` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `len(r) - 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the value found by `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is updated by the original value of `z` plus `q1 - to`**
