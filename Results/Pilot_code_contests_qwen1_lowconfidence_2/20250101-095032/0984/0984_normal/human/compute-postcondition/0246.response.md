The `bisect.bisect_left` function is used to find the index at which the element `l[1]` should be inserted in the list `q` to maintain sorted order. This function does not modify the lists `q` or `l`, but returns the index at which `l[1]` would be inserted.

Since `l` is a list containing the elements `[p[i], r[j]]`, `l[1]` refers to `r[j]`. The value of `to` will be the index at which `r[j]` should be inserted in `q` to keep `q` sorted.

Given the initial state:
- `r` must have at least one element.
- `q` is a sorted list.
- `l` is a sorted list containing the elements `[p[i], r[j]]`.

After executing the line `to = bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`, the variable `to` will hold the index at which `r[j]` should be inserted in `q`. The states of `r`, `q`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must have at least one element; `q` is a sorted list; `l` is a sorted list containing the elements `[p[i], r[j]]`; `to` is the index at which `r[j]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain sorted order.**
