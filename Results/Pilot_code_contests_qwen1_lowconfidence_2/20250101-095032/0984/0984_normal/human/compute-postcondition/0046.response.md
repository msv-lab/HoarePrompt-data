`j` is incremented by 1 in the initial state and must be less than the length of `q`. The code `l = sorted([p[i], q[j]])` sorts the elements at index `i` of `p` and at the new index `j` of `q` into a list `l`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `p` and `q`, the sorted list `l` will contain the elements from `p[i]` and `q[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the length of `q`; `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`**
