Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\)
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'
   - `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list, except for the key `s[0]` which has the value `[0]`
   - `i` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(len(s))`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 (since it started at 0).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `i < len(s)` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` will be adjusted to 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than the length of `s`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `d` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list, except for the key `s[0]` which has the value `[0]`; `i` is 1**
