The code `z += q1 - to` means that the value of `z` is updated by adding the result of `q1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial state is unknown for `z`, `q1`, and `to`, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the only thing we can say is that `z` is updated to be its current value plus `q1 - to`.

Output State: **`z` is its current value + `q1 - to`, the state of `q1` and `to` remains unchanged**
