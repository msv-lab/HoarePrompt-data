`z` is incremented by the value of `p1 - to`. The values of other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`len(r)` is at least 1, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains the same list after all iterations, `to` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`, `z` is increased by `p1 - to`, `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`, `isTrue` is the index in the slice `p[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain order.**
