The code snippet `z += r1 - to - 1` updates the value of `z` by adding `r1 - to - 1` to its current value. The values of the other variables (`l`, `j`, `to`, `isTrue`, and `p`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is to `z`.

Output State: **`l` is `[None, p[i]]`, `j` is the length of `q`, `to` is the position in `r` where `l[1]` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * p[i]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `z` is the original value of `z` plus `r1 - to - 1`.**
