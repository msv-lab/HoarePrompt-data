The code snippet `z += p1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `p1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial state is unknown, we cannot determine the specific values of `z`, `p1`, and `to`. Therefore, the only information we can provide is that `z` has been updated by the expression `p1 - to`.

Output State: **`z` is updated by `p1 - to`, `p1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
