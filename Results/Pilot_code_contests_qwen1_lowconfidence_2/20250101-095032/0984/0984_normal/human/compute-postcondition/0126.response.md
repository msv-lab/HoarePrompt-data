`z` is updated by adding the value of `p1 - to` to its current value. However, the initial values of `p1` and `to` are not provided. Since `to` is undefined initially, we cannot determine the exact value of `z`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `z` in terms of the initial value plus `p1 - to`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is [0, 0], `to` is undefined, `isTrue` is 0, `z` is the initial value of `z` plus `p1 - to`.**
