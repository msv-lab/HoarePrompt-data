The code snippet `to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])` impacts the following:

- `to` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`, which is the index in the list `r` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted.
- `l[1]` is the second element of the list `l`, which contains `p[i]` and `q[j]`. So, `l[1]` is `q[j]`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the length of `q`.

Given these points, the updated state of the variables is:

- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `l` remains a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`.
- `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`j` is incremented by 1, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order.**
