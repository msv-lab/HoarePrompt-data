Postcondition: ***`q` has at least one element, `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` should be inserted in `r` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into the sublist `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, `z` is updated based on the value of either `z + (r1 - to - 1)` or `r1 - to`, `to` is the index where `l[1] (or `q[j]`) should be inserted into `r` to maintain the sorted order.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that the relationships between the variables remain consistent regardless of which branch of the if-else statement is executed.
