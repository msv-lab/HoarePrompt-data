The given code snippet `z += p1 - to` modifies the value of `z`. However, the initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown. We know that `z` is updated by adding the result of `p1 - to` to its current value. Since the initial values are unknown, the output state will reflect this uncertainty.

Output State: **`z` is updated by adding the result of `p1 - to` to its current value, `p1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
