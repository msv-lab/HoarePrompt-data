Functionality: **The function `func` accepts an integer `N` (such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\)) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'. It constructs a dictionary `d` mapping each unique character in `S` to a list of its indices. Then, it iterates through all possible pairs of indices from the lists of 'R', 'G', and 'B' characters, checking if the third character can be found at an index that satisfies a specific condition related to the arithmetic mean of the pair's indices. The function counts the number of valid triples `(R, G, B)` where the index of 'B' is exactly twice the arithmetic mean of the indices of 'R' and 'G'. Finally, it prints the total count of such valid triples.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not check if the input string `S` contains any characters other than 'R', 'G', and 'B'. While this is implied by the problem statement, it is not explicitly verified in the code.
- The function assumes that `S` always contains at least one occurrence of each character 'R', 'G', and 'B'. This is not guaranteed by the problem statement, and the function should handle cases where `S` might lack one or more of these characters.
- The function does not return a value; instead, it directly prints the result. Depending on the intended use, this could be a limitation, as the caller cannot easily capture the result for further processing.

**Final State After Program Execution:**
- The final state of the program will have printed the total count of valid triples `(R, G, B)` satisfying the condition, or 0 if no such triples exist. The variables `p`, `q`, `r`, `p1`, `q1`, `r1`, `z`, `i`, `j`, and `l` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loops, reflecting the last computed count.
