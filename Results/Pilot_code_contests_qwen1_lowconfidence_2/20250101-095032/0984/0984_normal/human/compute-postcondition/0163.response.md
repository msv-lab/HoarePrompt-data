The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])` impacts the program by assigning the value of the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the list `p` to maintain it in sorted order to the variable `to`. The lists `q` and `r` remain unchanged, and the list `l` remains unchanged except for the implicit use of its second element.

Since the initial state is that `l` contains `[q[i], r[j]]` sorted in ascending order and `q` and `r` remain unchanged, the only variable affected is `to`, which is assigned the index where `l[1]` (which is `r[j]`) would be inserted into `p`.

Output State: **`l` contains [q[i], r[j]], `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `to` is the index where r[j] would be inserted into p to maintain it in sorted order.**
