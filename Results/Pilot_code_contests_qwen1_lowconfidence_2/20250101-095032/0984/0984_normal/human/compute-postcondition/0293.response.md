The code `z += q1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `q1 - to` to its current value. Since the initial state of the variables is unknown, the only thing we can definitively say is that `z` will be updated by the expression `q1 - to`. 

Output State: **`z` is updated by the value of `q1 - to`, the state of `q1` and `to` remains unchanged.**
