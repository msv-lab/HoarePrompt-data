Postcondition: **`j` is less than `len(q)`, `l` is the sorted list `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the position where `l[1]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted, `z` is the sum of all valid increments based on the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` for all iterations of the loop, and the condition `(r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0])` is true**
