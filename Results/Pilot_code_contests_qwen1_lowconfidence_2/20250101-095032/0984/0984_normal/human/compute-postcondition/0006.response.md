The code `d[i] = []` appends an empty list to the dictionary `d` using the key `i`. The key `i` is the second character of the string `s`.

From the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B' with the first character processed and at least one more character left
- `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first character of `s` and the value is an empty list
- `i` is the second character of `s`

After executing `d[i] = []`:
- The value of `d` remains unchanged in terms of its first key-value pair (the first character of `s` still maps to an empty list)
- An additional key-value pair is added to `d`, where the key is the second character of `s` (variable `i`) and the value is an empty list `[]`

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B' with the first character processed and at least one more character left; `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs, where the first key is the first character of `s` and the value is an empty list, and the second key is the second character of `s` and the value is an empty list; `i` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B' with the first character processed and at least one more character left; `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs, where the first key is the first character of `s` and the value is an empty list, and the second key is the second character of `s` and the value is an empty list; `i` is the second character of `s`.**
