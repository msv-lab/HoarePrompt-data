The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the user input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\), the value of `n` will be within this range. However, the exact value of `n` depends on the user's input.

Given the precondition that `N` is an integer in the specified range, the output state should reflect that `n` has taken the place of `N` in the same range. The string `S` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `S` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'.**
