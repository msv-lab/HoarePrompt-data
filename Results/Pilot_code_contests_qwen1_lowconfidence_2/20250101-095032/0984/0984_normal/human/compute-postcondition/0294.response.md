Step-by-step Analysis:
1. The `try` block checks if `q[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
2. If the condition is true, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`.
3. If the condition is false, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.
4. The `except` block catches any exception and ensures that `z` is updated by `q1 - to`.

Possible Exceptions:
- An exception can occur if `isTrue` is out of bounds for the slice `q[to:]`. This would happen if `isTrue` is negative or greater than or equal to the length of `q[to:]`.

Summarized Accomplishment:
- The `try` block increments `z` based on the comparison between `q[to:][isTrue]` and `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
- The `except` block ensures that `z` is incremented by `q1 - to` regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

Output State:
**`len(r)` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `len(r) - 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is updated by `q1 - to - 1` if `q[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, otherwise `z` is updated by `q1 - to`.**
