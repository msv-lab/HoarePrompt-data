Postcondition: ***`l` contains [q[i], r[j]], `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `to` is the index where `r[j]` would be inserted into `p` to maintain it in sorted order, `isTrue` is the insertion point for 2 * `r[j]` - `q[i]` in `p[to:]` to maintain sorted order, `z` is incremented by either `p1 - to - 1` or `p1 - to` depending on whether `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false.***
