`q` is assigned the value of `d['G']`, which is a list containing all the indices of the character 'G' in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is a list containing all indices of that character in `s`; `i` is the last index of `s`; `p` is a list of indices where the character 'R' appears in `s`; `q` is the list of indices where the character 'G' appears in `s`.
