The code assigns the list of indices where the character 'R' appears in the string `s` to the variable `p`. The variable `d` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` also remains unchanged since the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is a list containing all indices of that character in `s`; `i` is the last index of `s`; `p` is a list of indices where the character 'R' appears in `s`.**
