Postcondition: **`j` is less than `len(q) - 1`; `l` is the sorted list `[p[i], q[j]]`; `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order; `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted; `z` is incremented by either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` based on the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`. If the condition is true, `z` is additionally incremented by `r1 - to - 1`. If the condition is false or an exception occurs, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.**
