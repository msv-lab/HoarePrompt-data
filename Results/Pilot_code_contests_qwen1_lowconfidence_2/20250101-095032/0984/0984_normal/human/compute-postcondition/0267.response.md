`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`. Given that `l` is sorted, `l[0]` is `r[j]` and `l[1]` is `p[i]` (since `j` is `j_prev + 3` and `l` is constructed from `p[i]` and `r[j]`). The value of `isTrue` is updated to the result of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. Since `l[0]` is `r[j]` and `l[1]` is `p[i]`, the expression `2 * l[1] - l[0]` simplifies to `2 * p[i] - r[j]`. The value of `to` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`j` is `j_prev + 3`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(q, r[j])`, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * p[i] - r[j])`, and `z` remains unchanged.**
