Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted, `z` is increased by `r1 - to - 1`.**
