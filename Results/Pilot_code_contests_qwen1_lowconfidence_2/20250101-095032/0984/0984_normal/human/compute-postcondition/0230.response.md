Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `l` is `[p[i], r[j]]` sorted, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into `q` to maintain order, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is the sum of all valid increments, and `r` must have at least one element. If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is the sum of all valid increments plus `q1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is the sum of all valid increments plus `q1 - to`.***
