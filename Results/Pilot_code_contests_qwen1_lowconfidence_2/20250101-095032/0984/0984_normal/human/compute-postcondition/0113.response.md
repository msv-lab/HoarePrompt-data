Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j + 1]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in list `r` using binary search, `isTrue` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is either increased by `r1 - to - 1` or `z + r1 - to` depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false.***
