Output State: **`q` has at least one element, `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` should be inserted in `r` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` (which is `2 * q[j] - p[i]`) would be inserted into the sublist `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, `z` is updated based on the try and except blocks.**
