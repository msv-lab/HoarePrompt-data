The code `l = sorted([p[i], q[j]])` sorts the list containing the elements `p[i]` and `q[j]`. Since `q` must have at least one element, we know `q[j]` exists, but we don't know the exact values of `p[i]` and `q[j]`. After sorting, `l` will contain these two elements in ascending order.

Output State: **`q` must have at least one element; `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[j]]`**
