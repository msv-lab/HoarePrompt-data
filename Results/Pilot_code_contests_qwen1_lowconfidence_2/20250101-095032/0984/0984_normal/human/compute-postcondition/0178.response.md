### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Points Where Exception Can Occur**:
   - The `try` block checks if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`. If this comparison fails, the `else` block executes.
   - An exception can occur if `p[to:][isTrue]` raises an error during indexing. This typically happens if `isTrue` is out of bounds for the slice `p[to:]`.

2. **Summarize What the Try Except Statement Accomplishes**:
   - The `try` block checks whether the element at the index `isTrue` in the slice `p[to:]` matches the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
     - If the condition is true (`p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`), then `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`.
     - If the condition is false, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`.
   - The `except` block catches any exception and ensures that `z` is incremented by `p1 - to` regardless of whether the condition in the `try` block succeeds or fails.

3. **Program Output State After Execution**:
   - `l` contains `[q[i], r[j+1]]` sorted.
   - `q` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `to` is the index where `r[j+1]` would be inserted into `p` to maintain it in sorted order.
   - `isTrue` is assigned the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[j+1] - q[i])`.
   - `z` is updated based on the conditions within the `try` and `except` blocks.

### Final Output State

**Output State:**
`l` contains `[q[i], r[j+1]]` sorted, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `to` is the index where `r[j+1]` would be inserted into `p` to maintain it in sorted order, `isTrue` is assigned the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[j+1] - q[i])`, and `z` is updated to `z + max(0, p1 - to - 1)` if no exception occurs; otherwise, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`.
