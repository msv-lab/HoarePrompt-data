The initial state is unknown, so let's assume `z`, `r1`, and `to` are variables that can hold any values. The code snippet updates `z` by adding the value of `r1 - to` to its current value.

Given this, the new value of `z` will be the original value of `z` plus `r1 - to`. However, since the exact initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are not specified, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`z` is the original value of `z` plus `r1 - to`, `r1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
