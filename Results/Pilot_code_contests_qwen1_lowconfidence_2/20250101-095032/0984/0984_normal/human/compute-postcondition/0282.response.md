`z` is incremented by `q1 - to`. The values of `q1` and `to` are specific to the current state, and `z` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(r)` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `len(r) - 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in the list `q` or the insertion point where `l[1]` would maintain the sorted order if inserted in the list `q`, `isTrue` is not the index where `2 * r[j] - p[i]` fits in the list `q[to:]`, `z` is increased by `q1 - to`**
