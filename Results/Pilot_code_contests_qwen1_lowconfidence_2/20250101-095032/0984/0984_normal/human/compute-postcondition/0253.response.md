The code `z += q1 - to` increments `z` by the value of `q1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, we cannot specify exact numerical values for them. The only change in the state is that `z` is now `z + (q1 - to)`. 

Output State: **`z` is `z + (q1 - to)`, `q1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
