Postcondition: ***`l` is `[None, p[i]]`, `j` is the length of `q`, `to` is the position in `r` where `l[1]` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * p[i]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `z` is the original value of `z` plus `r1 - to - 1` if `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, otherwise `z` is the original value of `z` plus `r1 - to`.***
