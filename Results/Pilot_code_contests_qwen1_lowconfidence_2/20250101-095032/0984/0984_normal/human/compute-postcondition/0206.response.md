`z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. The value of `p1 - to` is not specified in the initial state, but we know that `z` was incremented by `p1 - to - 1` if certain conditions were met or by `p1 - to` if those conditions were not met. However, the current line only updates `z` by `p1 - to`.

Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`; `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into `p` to maintain the sorted order; `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`; `q` remains unchanged; `r` remains the same list after all iterations; `isTrue` is the index of `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `p[to:]` or the length of `p[to:]` if `2 * l[1] - l[0]` is not found.**
