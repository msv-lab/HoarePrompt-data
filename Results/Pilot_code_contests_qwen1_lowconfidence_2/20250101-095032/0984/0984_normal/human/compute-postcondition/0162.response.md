The given code snippet `l = sorted([q[i], r[j]])` sorts the list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`. However, without knowing the specific values of `q[i]` and `r[j]`, we cannot determine the exact values in the sorted list. We only know that `l` will contain two elements from `q[i]` and `r[j]` in ascending order.

Output State: **`l` contains [q[i], r[j]] sorted in ascending order, `q` and `r` remain unchanged**
