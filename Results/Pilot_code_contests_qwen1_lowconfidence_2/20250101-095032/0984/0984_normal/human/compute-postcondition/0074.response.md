`z` is incremented by `r1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, we cannot provide specific values for the updated `z`. The only information we can definitively state is the operation performed.

Output State: **`z` is increased by `r1 - to`, `r1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
