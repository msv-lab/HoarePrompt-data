Postcondition: **`j` is equal to the length of `q` - 1; `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[len(q) - 1]]`; `to` is the index where `q[len(q) - 1]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order; `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`; `z` is the sum of all valid increments based on the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`; the current value of `z` is such that the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` holds true**
