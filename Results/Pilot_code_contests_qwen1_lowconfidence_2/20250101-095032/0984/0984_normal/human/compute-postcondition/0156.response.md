Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is `len(r) - 1`, `l` is sorted([q[1], r[len(r) - 1]]), `to` is the index where `l[1]` fits in `p`, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` fits in the sublist `p[to:]`, `z` is the sum of all valid increments based on the condition `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * r[len(r) - 1] - q[1]` for all iterations of the loop, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, and `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`**
