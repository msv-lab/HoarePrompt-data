Postcondition: ***`len(r)` is at least 1, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains the same list after all iterations, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in `p` (or the insertion point if `l[1]` is not present), `z` is updated based on the following conditions: if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is `z + (p1 - to - 1)`. Otherwise, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`, and `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`.***
