The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` will append the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list associated with the key `s[i]` in the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state, the key `s[0]` already has the value `[0]` and the key `s[1]` has the value `[1]`. Since `i` is 3, the key `s[i]` does not yet exist in the dictionary and will be created with an empty list, and the value 3 will be appended to this list.

Therefore, the dictionary `d` will now have the following entries:
- `d[s[0]]` is `[0]`
- `d[s[1]]` is `[1]`
- `d[s[3]]` is `[3]`

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list, except for the key `s[0]` which has the value `[0]` and the key `s[1]` which has the value `[1]`; `d[s[3]]` is `[3]; i` is 3**
