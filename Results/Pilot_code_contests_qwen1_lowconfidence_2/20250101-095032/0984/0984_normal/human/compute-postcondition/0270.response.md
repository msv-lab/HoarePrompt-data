Postcondition: ***`j` is `j_prev + 3`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(q, r[j])`, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * p[i] - r[j])`, and `z` is updated as follows: if `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is `z` + `q1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is `z + (q1 - to)`***
