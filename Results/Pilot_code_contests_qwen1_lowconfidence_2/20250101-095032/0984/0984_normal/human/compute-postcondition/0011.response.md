The code snippet `d[s[i]].append(i)` will append the current index `i` to the list corresponding to the character `s[i]` in the dictionary `d`. Initially, `i` is 0, so this line of code will add 0 to the list associated with `s[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'
- `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list
- `i` is 0

After executing the line `d[s[i]].append(i)`, the value of `i` remains unchanged (still 0), but the dictionary `d` will have one of its lists updated. Specifically, the list corresponding to the character `s[0]` will now contain the value 0.

The updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'
- `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list, except for the key `s[0]` which has the value `[0]`
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each unique character in `s` is a key and the corresponding value is an empty list, except for the key `s[0]` which has the value `[0]`; `i` is 0**
