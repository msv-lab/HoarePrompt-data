Postcondition: ***`j` is `j_prev + 2`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `r[j]` is inserted into `q` to keep `q` sorted, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[j] - p[i])`, if `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is updated by `z += q1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is updated by `z += q1 - to`.***
