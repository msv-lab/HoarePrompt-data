Postcondition: **`len(r)` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `len(r) - 1`, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in the list `q` or the insertion point where `l[1]` would maintain the sorted order if inserted in the list `q`, `isTrue` is not the index where `2 * r[j] - p[i]` fits in the list `q[to:]`**
