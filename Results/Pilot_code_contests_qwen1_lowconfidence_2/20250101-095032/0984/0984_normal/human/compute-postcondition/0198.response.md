Postcondition: ***`len(r)` is at least 1, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains the same list after all iterations, `to` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`, `z` is either incremented by `p1 - to - 1` if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` or by `p1 - to`, `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`, `isTrue` is the index in the slice `p[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain order.***
