`z` is incremented by the difference between `r1` and `to`. Since the initial value of `r1` and `to` is not specified, we will keep them as `r1` and `to` in the output state.

Output State: **`q` has at least one element, `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` should be inserted in `r` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` (which is `2 * b - a`) would be inserted into the sublist `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, `r[to:]` does not contain the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.**
