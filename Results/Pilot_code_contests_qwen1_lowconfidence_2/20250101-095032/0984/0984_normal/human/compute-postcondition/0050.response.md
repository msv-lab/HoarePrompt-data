`z` is incremented by the value of `r1 - to`. The value of `r1` and the current value of `to` are not specified, so they remain as they are. The other variables (`j`, `l`, `to`, `isTrue`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.**
