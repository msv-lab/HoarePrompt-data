Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a sorted list containing either `[q[0], r[1]]` or `[r[1], q[0]]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` fits in the sorted list `p`, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` fits in the sublist `p[to:]`, `z` is the initial value of `z` plus either `p1 - to - 1` if the condition `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, or `p1 - to` if the condition is false.***
