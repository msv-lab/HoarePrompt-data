Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], q[j]]`, `j` is equal to the length of `q`, `to` is the first index in `r` where `l[1]` could be inserted while maintaining the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into `r[to:]` to maintain its sorted order, and `z` is the sum of all valid increments based on the condition `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` or `r[to:][isTrue] != 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, which includes either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` respectively. If an exception occurs, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.**
