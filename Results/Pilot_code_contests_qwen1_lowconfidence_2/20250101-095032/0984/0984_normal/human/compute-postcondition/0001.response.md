The code `s = raw_input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the initial state defines that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\) and `S` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B', after executing this line of code, the value of `s` will be the same as `S`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'R', 'G', and 'B'**
