Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `l` is `[q[0], r[2]]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` fits in the sorted list `p`, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` fits in the sublist `p[to:]`, and `z` is the initial value of `z` plus either `p1 - to - 1` if the condition `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, or `p1 - to` if the condition is false or an exception occurs.***
