The initial state is unknown, but let's consider the impact of the code snippet `z += q1 - to`.

- `z` is incremented by the value of `q1 - to`. Since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `z` after the operation, but we know that `z` is now `z + (q1 - to)`.
- No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`z` is `z + (q1 - to)`, `q1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
