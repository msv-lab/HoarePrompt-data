`z` is incremented by the value of `r1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, the only specific change we can make is to express `z` in terms of its previous value plus `r1 - to`. Therefore, the output state is that `z` is updated to its previous value plus `r1 - to`.

Output State: **`z` is updated to its previous value + `r1 - to`**
