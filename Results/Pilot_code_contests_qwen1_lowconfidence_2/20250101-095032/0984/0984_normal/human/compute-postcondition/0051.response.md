Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` would be inserted into `r` to maintain its sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted, and `z` is increased by either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to`, depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false.***
