Postcondition: ***`q` has at least one element, `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the index where `q[j]` should be inserted in `r` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` (which is `2 * b - a`) would be inserted into the sublist `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order. If `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `r[to:]` remains sorted and `z` is updated by adding `r1 - to - 1` to its original value. Otherwise, `r[to:]` does not contain the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, and `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.***
