The code `z += p1 - to` impacts the variable `z`. It increments `z` by the value of `p1 - to`. 

Here are the specific values before the operation:
- `z` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `p1` and `to` are specific values from the previous state.

After executing `z += p1 - to`, the value of `z` is updated to `z + (p1 - to)`.

Output State: **`l` contains `[q[i], r[j+1]]` sorted, `q` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `to` is the index where `r[j+1]` would be inserted into `p` to maintain it in sorted order, `isTrue` is assigned the result of `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * r[j+1] - q[i])`, `z` is updated to `z + (p1 - to)`.**
