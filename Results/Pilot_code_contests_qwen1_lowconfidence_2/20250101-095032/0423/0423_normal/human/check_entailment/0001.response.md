Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, the program constructs a graph where nodes are connected if their adjacent elements in the sequence have an absolute difference less than or equal to K. However, this approach is flawed because it does not properly handle the non-continuous subsequences that can satisfy the condition. Instead, it only considers direct adjacencies, which means it may miss valid subsequences with larger lengths.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 3
1
4
2
5
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `3` because the subsequence `[1, 4, 5]` is valid and has a length of 3, where the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements is at most 3. The program fails to account for such non-adjacent valid subsequences.
