The code assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to `num2`. This means `num2` is now equal to the element in `nums` at the index `node2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2]` is `[0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is the next value (i.e., `node2 + 1`), `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`**
