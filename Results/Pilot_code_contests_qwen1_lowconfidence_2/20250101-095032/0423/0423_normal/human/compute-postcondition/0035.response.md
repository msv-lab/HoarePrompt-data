Output State: **`num2` is equal to `nums[node2]` for all `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`. For each `node2` where the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, `graph[node2]` includes `node1`. Otherwise, `graph[node2]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, `num2` is set to the corresponding element in the `nums` list.
- If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, `node1` is appended to the list `graph[node2]`.
- After all iterations, `num2` will be the element `nums[node2]` for each `node2` that was checked during the loop.
- The state of `graph[node2]` will include `node1` for those `node2` where the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` was satisfied. For other `node2`, the state of `graph[node2]` will remain as it was initially (which could be an empty list or a list containing `[0]` if the condition was not met in previous iterations).
