Postcondition: ***`max_` is the maximum of its current value and the new `len_`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended. Specifically, if `len(graph[node]) == 0`, then `len_` is set to 1; otherwise, `len_` remains as either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one.***
