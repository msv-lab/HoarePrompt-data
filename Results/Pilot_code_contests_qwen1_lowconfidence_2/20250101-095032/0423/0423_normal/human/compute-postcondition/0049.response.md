`graph[node2]` is appended with `node1`. This means that `node1` is added to the list of neighbors of `node2` in the `graph`. The values of `num1`, `num2`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[node2]` contains `node1`, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` is greater than `node2 + 3`**
