The code `print(max_)` simply prints the value of `max_` to the console but does not change the value of any variable. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`max_` is the longest path length from any node to a leaf node, `n` is the number of nodes, and `lens` contains the path lengths from each node to the farthest leaf node.**
