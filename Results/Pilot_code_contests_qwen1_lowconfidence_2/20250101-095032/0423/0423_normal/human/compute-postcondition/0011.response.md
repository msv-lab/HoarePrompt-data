According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `node1 + 1` to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `n` is at least 2
- `k` is the second integer input
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input
- `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2]` is `[0]`
- `node1` is 0
- `num1` is the first element of `nums`
- `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1`
- `num2` is the element at index `node2` in `nums`

The loop will continue if `node2` is within the specified range (`node1 + 1` to `n`). Given that the previous `node2` was in the range 1 to `n-1`, the next possible value for `node2` would be the current `node2` incremented by 1 (if it is not yet equal to `n`), and the condition `node2` in the range 1 to `n-1` must still hold true.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `node2` needs to be the next valid value within the specified range.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2]` is `[0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is the next value (i.e., `node2 + 1`), `num2` is the element at index `node2 + 1` in `nums`**
