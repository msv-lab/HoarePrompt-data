Let's break down the given for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given:
- The state before the loop starts is: `graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`.
- The for loop is: `for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `graph`: Remains unchanged (no modification needed).
   - `num1`: Equal to `nums[node1]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to start executing, there must be at least one valid `node2` value within the specified range (`node1 + 1` to `n-1`).

4. **Determining the Range**:
   - The loop will run as long as `node2` values exist in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
   - This means `n` should be greater than `node1 + 1` to ensure at least one `node2` exists.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop relies on `node2` being within the specified range, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`.
   - We don't need to adjust `num1` or `graph` since they are already correctly defined.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`**
