The code appends `node1` to `graph[node2]`. Given the initial state, `node1` is 0 and `node2` is now `node2 + 1`. The value of `graph[node2]` changes from `[0, 0]` to `[0, 0, 0]` because `graph[node2].append(node1)` adds `node1` (which is 0) to the list `graph[node2]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2 + 1]` is now `[0, 0, 0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is now `node2 + 1`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`**
