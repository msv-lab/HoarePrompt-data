The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. Given the initial state, `node1` is 0, and `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1`. The value of `graph[node2]` is initially `[0]`. After appending `node1`, `graph[node2]` will become `[0, 0]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2]` is now `[0, 0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is the next value (i.e., `node2 + 1`), `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`**
