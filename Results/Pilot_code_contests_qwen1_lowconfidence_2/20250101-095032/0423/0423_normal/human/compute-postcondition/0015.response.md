Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `nums` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, except `graph[node2]` is now `[0, 0]`.
   - `node1` is 0.
   - `num1` is the first element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[0]`).
   - `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is the next value (i.e., `node2 + 1`).
   - `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration, it checks if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If true, `graph[node2]` is set to `[0, 0]`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
     - `node2` was the value that was just checked.
     - `num2` is `nums[node2]`.
     - If the condition was met, `graph[node2]` was set to `[0, 0]`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node2` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The new `node2` will be `node2 + 1`.

6. **New States**:
   - `node2` will now be `node2 + 1`.
   - `num2` will be `nums[node2 + 1]`.
   - `graph[node2 + 1]` will need to be checked against the condition.

Therefore, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2 + 1]` is now `[0, 0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is now `node2 + 1`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2 + 1]` is now `[0, 0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is now `node2 + 1`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`.**
