`num2` is assigned the value of `nums[node2]`. Given the initial state, `node2` is in the range `1` to `n-1`, so `num2` will be set to the element at index `node2` in the list `nums`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range `1` to `n-1`, `num2` is the element at index `node2` in `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range `1` to `n-1`, `num2` is the element at index `node2` in `nums`**
