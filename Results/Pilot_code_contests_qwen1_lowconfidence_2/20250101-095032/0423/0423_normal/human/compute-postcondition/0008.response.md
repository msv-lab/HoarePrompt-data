Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1`, `num2` is the element at index `node2` in `nums`. The absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.***
