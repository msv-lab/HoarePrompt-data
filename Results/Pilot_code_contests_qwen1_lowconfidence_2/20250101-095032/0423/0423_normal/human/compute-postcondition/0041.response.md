The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. This means that `graph[node2]` now contains `num2` and `node1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[node2]` contains `num2` and `node1`, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`, the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
