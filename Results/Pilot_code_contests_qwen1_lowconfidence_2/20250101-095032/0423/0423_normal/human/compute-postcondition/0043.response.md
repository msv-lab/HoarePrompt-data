Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `graph` remains unchanged.
   - `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`.
   - `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`.
   - `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `node2` was one value lower than it will be in the next iteration.
   - `num1` and `num2` were determined based on the previous `node2`.
   - The condition checked if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node2` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new `node2` will be `node1 + 2`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `graph` remains unchanged.
   - `num1` is still `nums[node1]` (it does not change within the loop).
   - `num2` is now `nums[node2 + 1]` (since `node2` is incremented by 1).
   - `n` must still be greater than `node1 + 1`.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 2]`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 2`**.
