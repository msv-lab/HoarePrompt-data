The code updates the value of `len_` to be the maximum length among the children of the current `node` plus one. The initial state provides that `len_` is determined based on the new `node` (either 1 or the maximum length of its children plus one), and `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended.

Let's denote the initial value of `len_` as `len_initial` and the maximum length among the children of `node` as `max_children_length`. The updated value of `len_` will be `max_children_length + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `max_` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `len_` is updated to `max_children_length + 1`.
- `lens` is updated by appending the new `len_` to it.

Output State: **`max_` is max(max_initial, len_initial), `n` is greater than 0, `len_` is max_children_length + 1, `lens` is `lens` with the new len_ appended.**
