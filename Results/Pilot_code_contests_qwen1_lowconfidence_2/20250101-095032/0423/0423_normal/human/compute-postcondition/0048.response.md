The code assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to `num2`. Before the assignment, `num2` was equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`. After the assignment, `num2` now equals `nums[node2]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, and `n` must be greater than `node2 + 3`.

Output State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node2 + 3`**
