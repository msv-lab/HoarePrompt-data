`lens.append(len_)` appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. Given the initial state, `len_` is either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one. Therefore, the list `lens` will have its last element updated to this value.

Output State: **`max_` is the maximum value between `max_initial` and either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, `n` must be greater than 0, `len_` is either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, and `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended.**
