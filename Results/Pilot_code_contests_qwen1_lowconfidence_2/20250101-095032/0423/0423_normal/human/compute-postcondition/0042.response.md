Postcondition: ***`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `num2` and `node1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
