Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, for each `node2` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `graph[node2]` is a list that may or may not contain `0`, depending on whether the absolute difference between `num1` and `nums[node2]` is less than or equal to `k`. If the condition is met, `graph[node2]` will contain `[0]`; otherwise, it will remain empty.**
