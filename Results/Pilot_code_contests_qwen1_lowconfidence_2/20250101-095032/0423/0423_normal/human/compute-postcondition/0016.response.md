The code assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to `num2`. Before this assignment, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`. After the assignment, `num2` will be updated to the value of `nums[node2]`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Previous Values**: 
   - `num2` was originally equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`.
   - Now, `num2` is reassigned to `nums[node2]`.

2. **Updated Values**: 
   - `num2` is now `nums[node2]`.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2 + 1]` is now `[0, 0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is now `node2 + 1`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`.**
