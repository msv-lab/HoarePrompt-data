`num1` is assigned the value of `nums[node1]`. The variable `graph` remains unchanged because it was not mentioned or affected in the code snippet. The state of `nums` and `node1` is also not specified in the initial state, so they are left as they are.

Output State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`**
