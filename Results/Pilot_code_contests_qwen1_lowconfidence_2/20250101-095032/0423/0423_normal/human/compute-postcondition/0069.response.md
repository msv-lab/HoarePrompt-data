Let's break down the given information and think through the process step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `max_`: The maximum of its current value and `len_`.
   - `n`: Must be greater than 0.
   - `len_`: Either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one.
   - `lens`: A list containing the values of `len_` with the new `len_` appended.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for node in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `node` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `node` changes from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is about to execute another iteration, the variable `node` will increment by 1.
   - The loop condition `node < n` must still hold true.
   - All other variables (`max_`, `len_`, `lens`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop (as indicated by the comment "the loop body is omitted").

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - `max_`: Remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n`: Remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `len_`: Remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `lens`: Appends the new `len_` value to the list.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `max_` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `len_` remains the same.
- `lens` will append the new `len_` value.

Since no specific values for `max_`, `len_`, or `lens` were provided, we will use the general form:

**State: **`max_` is the maximum of its current value and `len_`, `n` must be greater than 0, `len_` is either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, and `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended**.
