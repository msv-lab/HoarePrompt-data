The given code snippet is setting up an input function using `input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`. This means that when input is called, it will read a line from standard input and strip any trailing whitespace. However, this does not change the values of any variables or affect the list `A` in any way.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **N and K are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 300,000 and 0 ≤ K ≤ 300,000; the list A is a sequence of N integers where 0 ≤ A_i ≤ 300,000 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N.**
