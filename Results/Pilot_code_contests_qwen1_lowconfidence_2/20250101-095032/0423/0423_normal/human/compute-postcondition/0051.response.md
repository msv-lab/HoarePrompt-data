Output State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` is greater than `node1 + (number of iterations)`. For each iteration where the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` is satisfied, `graph[node2]` will contain `node1`. Otherwise, no changes occur.**

### Explanation:
- **`graph`**: Remains unchanged throughout the loop since no modification to the `graph` is done outside of appending `node1` to `graph[node2]` based on the condition.
- **`num1`**: Remains unchanged as it is initialized to `nums[node1]` and is not modified within the loop.
- **`num2`**: Takes on the value of `nums[node2]` for each iteration of the loop where `node2` ranges from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than `node1 + (number of iterations)` for the loop to execute the required number of times. If the loop does not execute, `n` retains its original value.
- **Condition Check**: For each iteration where the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k` is satisfied, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`. Otherwise, `graph[node2]` remains unchanged.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations, considering both the cases where the loop executes and where it does not.
