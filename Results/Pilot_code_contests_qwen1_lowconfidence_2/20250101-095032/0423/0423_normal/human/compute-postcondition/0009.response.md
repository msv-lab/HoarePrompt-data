The code appends `node1` to the list at index `node2` in `graph`. Initially, `node1` is 0 and `num2` is the element at index `node2` in `nums`. After the execution of the line `graph[node2].append(node1)`, the list at index `node2` in `graph` will include `node1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `node1` is 0,
- `num2` is the element at index `node2` in `nums`.

After the code execution, the list at index `node2` in `graph` will be `[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2]` is `[0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1`, `num2` is the element at index `node2` in `nums`. The absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
