Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists with the exception that `graph[node2 + 1]` is now `[0, 0]`, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` is in the range 1 to `n-1` and is now `node2 + 1`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, `graph[node2 + 1]` is updated to `[0, 0, 0]`. Otherwise, `graph[node2 + 1]` remains unchanged.***
