The code appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. The initial state provides that `lens` is updated such that if `len(graph[node]) == 0`, then `len_` is set to 1; otherwise, `len_` remains as either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one. The state of the other variables (`max_`, `n`, and `graph`) is not affected.

Therefore, the value of `len_` is appended to `lens`.

Output State: **`max_` is the maximum of its current value and the new `len_`, `n` must be greater than 0, `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended.**
