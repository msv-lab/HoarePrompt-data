To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input.
   - `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists.
   - `node1` is 0.
   - `num1` is the first element of `nums`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   ```python
   for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   - The loop iterates over the range from `node1 + 1` to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one valid value for `node2` in the range `range(node1 + 1, n)`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since `node1` is 0, the loop will start iterating from `1` to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already stated as `n` is at least 2).
   - Additionally, the loop will only execute if `n > 1`, meaning there must be at least one value for `node2` in the range `range(1, n)`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute:**
   - To ensure there is at least one valid `node2`, we need to ensure `n` is strictly greater than 1. However, since it's already stated `n` is at least 2, this condition is satisfied.
   - We need to explicitly state that `node2` will take values within the defined range.

5. **Additional Information to Include:**
   - `node2` must take values from the range `1` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, `node2` must take values from the range `1` to `n-1`**
