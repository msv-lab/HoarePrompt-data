Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is at least 2
- `k` is the second integer input
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input
- `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists
- `node1` is 0 (initial value)
- `num1` is the first element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[0]`)
- For each `node2` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `graph[node2]` is a list that may or may not contain `[0]`, depending on whether the absolute difference between `num1` and `nums[node2]` is less than or equal to `k`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for node1 in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over `node1` from 0 to `n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `node1` would have been one of the values from 0 to `n - 2`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `node1` must take the next value in the range, which would be `node1 + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `node1` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `num1` remains the same as it is not dependent on `node1`.
- `graph` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body based on `node1`.

### Updated States:
- Since `node1` is incremented by 1, the new value of `node1` will be `(previous node1 value + 1)`.
- The condition for `graph[node2]` to contain `[0]` still depends on the absolute difference between `num1` and `nums[node2]`.

### Final Answer:
At the start of the next iteration, `node1` will be 1 if it was 0 previously. The other states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 1, `num1` is the first element of `nums`, for each `node2` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `graph[node2]` is a list that may or may not contain `[0]`, depending on whether the absolute difference between `num1` and `nums[node2]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
