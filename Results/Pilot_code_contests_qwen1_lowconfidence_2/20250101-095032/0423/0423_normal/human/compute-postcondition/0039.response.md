The code assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to `num2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`.

Output State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`**
