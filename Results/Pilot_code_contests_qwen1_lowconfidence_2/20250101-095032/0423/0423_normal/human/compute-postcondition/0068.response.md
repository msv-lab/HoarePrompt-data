The code updates the value of `max_` to be the maximum of `len_` and the current `max_`. Given the initial state, `max_` is the maximum value between `max_initial` and either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, `n` must be greater than 0, `len_` is either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, and `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended.

After executing the line `max_ = max(len_, max_)`, `max_` will take the maximum value between its current value and `len_`.

Let's consider the two cases for `len_`:

1. If `len_` is 1:
   - If `max_` is greater than 1, then `max_` remains unchanged.
   - If `max_` is less than or equal to 1, then `max_` is updated to 1.

2. If `len_` is the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one:
   - If `max_` is less than this value, then `max_` is updated to this value.
   - If `max_` is greater than or equal to this value, then `max_` remains unchanged.

Given these conditions, the updated value of `max_` depends on the relative values of `max_` and `len_`.

Output State: **`max_` is the maximum of its current value and `len_`, `n` must be greater than 0, `len_` is either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, and `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended.**
