To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]` for all `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
- For each `node2` where the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, `graph[node2]` includes `node1`. Otherwise, `graph[node2]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Details
The loop iterates over `node1` from `0` to `n-2`.

### Analysis
1. **Range of `node1`**: The loop currently iterates from `0` to `n-2`. Therefore, the current value of `node1` is the last processed node1, which would be `n-2`.
   
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next `node1` should be `n-1`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration, the value of `node1` will be incremented by 1. Hence, `node1` will be `n-1`.
   - The values of `num2` and `graph` will be updated according to the rules specified in the loop body for the new `node1`.

### State at the Start of Next Iteration
- `num2` will be equal to `nums[node2]` for all `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`. Here, `node1` is `n-1`, so the range is from `n` to `n-1`, which means there are no valid `node2` in this range.
- `graph` will remain unchanged because there are no valid `node2` in the range from `n-1 + 1` to `n-1`.

### Final State
State: **`num2` is equal to `nums[node2]` for all `node2` in the range from `n` to `n-1` (which is an empty range), `graph` remains unchanged**.

However, since the range from `n` to `n-1` is empty, the actual state can be simplified to just noting the state of `graph` as it remains unchanged.

State: **`graph` remains unchanged**.

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`graph` remains unchanged**.
