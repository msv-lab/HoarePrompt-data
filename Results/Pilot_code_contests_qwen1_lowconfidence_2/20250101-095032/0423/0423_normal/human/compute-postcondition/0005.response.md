`num1` is assigned the value of `nums[node1]`. Since `node1` is 0, `num1` will be the first element of the list `nums`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 0, `num1` is the first element of `nums`**
