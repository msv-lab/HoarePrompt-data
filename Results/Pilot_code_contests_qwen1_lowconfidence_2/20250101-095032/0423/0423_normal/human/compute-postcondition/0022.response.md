To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start iterating over the specified range. The loop iterates over the range from `node1 + 1` to `n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will only execute if there are elements in this range.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`node1` value**: The loop starts with `node2 = node1 + 1`. Given `node1` is 1, the loop will start at `node2 = 2`. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in the range from 2 to `n-1`.

2. **`n` value**: The list `nums` has `n` elements. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 because `node1` is 1 and the loop starts at `node1 + 1`.

3. **`nums` list**: The `nums` list must have at least 3 elements (since `n` is at least 2 and `node1` is 1, meaning `n` must be at least 3 for `node1 + 1` to be within bounds).

4. **`graph` structure**: The structure of `graph` does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but it should be consistent with the given description.

5. **`num1` and `nums[node2]`**: These values do not affect the loop's ability to execute as they are used inside the loop body and do not influence the loop's starting condition.

Therefore, the key adjustments needed for the loop to execute are ensuring that `n` is at least 3 and there are elements in the range from 2 to `n-1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is at least 3, `nums` has at least 3 elements, `node1` is 1**
