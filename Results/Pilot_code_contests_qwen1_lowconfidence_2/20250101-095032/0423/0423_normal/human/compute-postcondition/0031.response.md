According to the code, the loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to `n - 1`. The loop body checks if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, then `graph[node2]` contains `num2` and `node1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`.
- If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `graph[node2]` contains `num2` and `node1`.

To determine the state for the next iteration of the loop:
1. The loop will continue as long as `node2 < n`.
2. The value of `node2` will increase by 1 in each iteration.
3. The value of `num2` will change to `nums[node2]` for the next iteration.

Let's step through the process:

1. At the end of the last iteration, `node2` was set to some value, say `j`, such that `j = node1 + 1 + (number of iterations so far)`.
2. For the next iteration, `node2` will be incremented by 1, so `node2` becomes `j + 1`.
3. `num2` will now be updated to `nums[node2]`, which is `nums[j + 1]`.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration will be:
- `num2` will be `nums[node2]`, where `node2` is `node1 + 1 + (number of iterations so far) + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `node2 < n`.

Given the general form, the specific state can be written as follows:

State: **`num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, where `node2` is `node1 + 2` (since it starts from `node1 + 1` and increments by 1), and the condition for the loop to continue is that `node2 < n`.**
