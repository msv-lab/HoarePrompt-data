The code initializes an empty list `lens`. No operations are performed on any of the existing variables, so their values remain unchanged. The output state includes the new list `lens` as well as the unchanged states of all other variables.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` lists representing the edges in the graph, `node1` is an index in the range [0, n-2], `num1` is the value at `nums[node1]`, `node2` is an index in the range [node1+1, n-1], `num2` is the value at `nums[node2]`, `lens` is an empty list**.
