According to the code, the loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to `n - 1`. The loop body is omitted, but it checks if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`. If true, it updates `graph[node2]` to contain `node1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`
- `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`
- `n` must be greater than `node2 + 2`

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `node2` should be incremented by 1.
2. `num2` should be updated to `nums[node2]`.
3. `n` must still be greater than `node2 + 2`.

Let's summarize these changes:

- `node2` becomes `node2 + 1`
- `num2` becomes `nums[node2 + 1]`
- `n` must still be greater than `(node2 + 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `n > node2 + 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`, `n` must be greater than `node2 + 3`**
