The code snippet `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. This does not change the values of `num1`, `num2`, or `k`, nor does it affect their relationships. The only change is in the structure of the `graph` dictionary.

Output State: **`num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`; `graph[node2]` now includes `node1`.**
