The code `num1 = nums[node1]` assigns the value of `nums[node1]` to `num1`. Given the initial state, `node1` is 1, so `num1` will be set to the second element of the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, `node1` is 1, `num1` is the second element of `nums`, for each `node2` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `graph[node2]` is a list that may or may not contain `[0]`, depending on whether the absolute difference between `num1` and `nums[node2]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
