The code initializes a graph as a list of empty lists, where the length of the list is `n`. This means that `graph` is now a list of `n` empty lists, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The `nums` list also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists**
