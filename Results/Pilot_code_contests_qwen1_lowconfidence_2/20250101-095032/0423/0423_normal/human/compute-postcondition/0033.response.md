The code `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. According to the initial state, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, where `node2` is `node1 + 2`, and the loop continues as long as `node2 < n`. This means that `num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 2]`. After running this line of code, the value of `num2` remains unchanged because the code does not directly modify `num2`. Instead, it modifies `graph[node2]`.

Output State: **`num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 2]`, `graph[node2]` includes `node1` in its list.**
