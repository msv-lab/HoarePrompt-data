The code updates the value of `len_` to be the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one. Let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. `len_` is initially either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one.
2. The code calculates `len_` as the maximum of the lengths of the children of `node` plus one.
3. Since `len_` is already either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, updating `len_` will not change its value if it was already the maximum.

Therefore, the value of `len_` remains the same as it was before the code execution. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_` is the maximum of its current value and `len_`, `n` must be greater than 0, `len_` is either 1 or the maximum length of the children of `node` plus one, and `lens` is `lens` with the new `len_` appended**
