According to the code, the loop iterates over `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n - 1`. The key conditions for including `node1` in `graph[node2]` are based on the values of `num1`, `num2`, and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`.
- The decision to include `node1` in `graph[node2]` depends on whether the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `node2` must be incremented by 1, making it `node1 + 2`.
- We need to check the value of `num2` for this new `node2`, which will be `nums[node1 + 2]`.

The state needs to be adjusted such that:
- `num2` becomes `nums[node1 + 2]`.
- The decision to include `node1` in `graph[node1 + 2]` will depend on the absolute difference between `num1` and `nums[node1 + 2]`.

State: **`num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 2]`**
