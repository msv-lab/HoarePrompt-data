The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. The variables `num1` and `num2` are derived from the values of `nums[node1]` and `nums[node2]` respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `graph[node2]` will contain `node1`.

Output State: **`graph[node2]` contains `node1`, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node2 + 2`**
