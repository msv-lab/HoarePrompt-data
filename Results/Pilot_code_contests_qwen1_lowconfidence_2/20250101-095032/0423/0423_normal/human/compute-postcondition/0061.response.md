The code appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. Given the initial state, `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is 0) or the maximum length of `[lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]` plus one (if the length of `graph[node]` is not 0). The values of `n` and the structure of `graph` remain unchanged.

Therefore, after executing `lens.append(len_)`, the variable `lens` will have its value updated by appending `len_`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if the length of `graph[node]` is 0, then `len_` is set to 1; if the length of `graph[node]` is not 0, then `len_` is set to the maximum length of `[lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]` plus one; `lens` is now `lens` with `len_` appended.**
