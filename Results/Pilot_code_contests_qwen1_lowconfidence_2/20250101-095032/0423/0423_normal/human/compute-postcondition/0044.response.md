`num2` is reassigned to the value of `nums[node2]`. The previous value of `num2` was `nums[node1 + 2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node2 + 2`.

Output State: **`graph` remains unchanged, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node2 + 2`**
