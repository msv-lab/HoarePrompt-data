The code `n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `N` and `K` from the initial state are replaced by the integers read from the input. The list `A` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a sequence of N integers where 0 ≤ A_i ≤ 300,000 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N; n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input**
