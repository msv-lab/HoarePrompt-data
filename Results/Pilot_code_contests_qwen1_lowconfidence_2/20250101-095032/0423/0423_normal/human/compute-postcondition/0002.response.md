`nums` is assigned a list of integers obtained by taking `n` inputs from the user, converting them to integers using `int()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The initial state of `A` is not relevant since it is not used in the given code.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input**
