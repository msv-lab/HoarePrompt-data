Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `nums` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `graph` is a list of `n` lists representing the edges in the graph, `node1` is an index in the range [0, n-2], `num1` is the value at `nums[node1]`, `node2` is an index in the range [node1+1, n-1], `num2` is the value at `nums[node2]`. For each `node2` in the range [node1+1, n-1], `graph[node2]` contains all indices `node1` such that `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`. If the loop does not execute, `graph` remains a list of `n` empty lists.**
