The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. In the initial state, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`. After executing the code, `num2` remains unchanged because the code does not affect its value directly. However, `graph[node2]` is updated by appending `node1` to it.

Output State: **`num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`; `graph[node2]` contains `num2` and `node1`**
