The provided function `func_1` does not define any variables or perform any operations that would affect the state of any variables. It merely describes a function that sets the synchronization setting for standard Python streams (stdin, stdout, stderr). Since no actual assignment or operation is performed within the function, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **There is no relevant variable from the provided function signature that pertains to the problem description. The function `func_1` does not use any of the variables related to the problem, such as the number of test cases, the size of the array, or the array elements themselves. The synchronization setting for standard Python streams is set based on the argument passed to the function.**
