Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to solve the given problem description. The problem requires finding the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make in a maze, but the given code appears to be related to some form of graph traversal using depth-first search or breadth-first search techniques, possibly for a different problem. 

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not match the context of the maze problem described. Specifically:
- `func_1` takes coordinates as input and seems to be attempting to find a path from one coordinate to another, but it does not define the graph structure properly for the maze.
- `func_2` is a helper function that checks for a specific condition ('found') and returns child nodes, but it does not seem to integrate with the main logic to calculate the maximum possible number of moves in the maze.

Given these observations, the program does not implement the required functionality and thus is incorrect.
