Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`, but the problem requires finding the maximum possible number of moves.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`. However, the problem requires finding the maximum possible number of moves, not the shortest path.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is also designed to find a path, but it only checks if a path exists between two points. It does not calculate the distance or the maximum possible number of moves.

Given these issues, the code will not correctly compute the maximum possible number of moves in the maze. For instance, consider a simple 2x2 maze with the following configuration:

```
.#
#.
```

The maximum possible number of moves should be 3 (from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner), but the current implementation will not correctly compute this.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
