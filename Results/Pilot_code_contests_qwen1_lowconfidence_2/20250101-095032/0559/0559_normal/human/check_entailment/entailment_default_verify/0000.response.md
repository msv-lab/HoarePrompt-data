Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically:

1. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not properly model the maze or the pathfinding required to solve the problem.
2. The functions do not account for the constraints of moving only to adjacent road squares or the requirement to find the maximum possible number of moves.
3. The `func_2` function is designed to find a single path to a target coordinate, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum possible number of moves in the maze.
4. The problem requires calculating the longest possible path between any two road squares in the maze, which is not addressed by the current implementation.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
