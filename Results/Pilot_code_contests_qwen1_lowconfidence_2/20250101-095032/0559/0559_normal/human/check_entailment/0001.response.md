Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to find the shortest path between two coordinates in a graph, but they do not correctly model the problem. Specifically:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program assumes that there is a pre-defined graph (`graph`) that needs to be passed to these functions. However, the problem description does not provide any information about how the maze should be represented as a graph. The maze is described using a grid, and the problem requires finding the maximum possible number of moves between any two road squares, not just the shortest path.

2. **Depth Dictionary Initialization**: The function `func_1` uses `depth_dict_org.copy()`, which suggests that there is an external variable `depth_dict_org`. This is not defined in the provided code and might lead to undefined behavior.

3. **Path Finding Logic**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` attempt to find the shortest path between two points, but the problem asks for the maximum possible number of moves, which would be the distance between the farthest two road squares in the maze.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and hence is incorrect.
