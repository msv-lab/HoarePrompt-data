Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make between any two road squares in the maze. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to find the shortest path between two given road squares, but it does not account for all possible paths between any two road squares in the maze. This results in the program failing to consider the possibility of multiple disjoint road squares or complex mazes where the longest path may not necessarily be a direct path between two specific road squares.

For example, consider the following maze:

```
...#
..#.
.###
#...
```

In this maze, there are several road squares that are not directly connected. The longest possible path would involve traversing through different sections of the maze, potentially visiting multiple road squares. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only finds the shortest path between two specified road squares, which does not guarantee the maximum possible number of moves.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
