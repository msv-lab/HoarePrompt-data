Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the requirement to find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make. Instead, the provided code appears to attempt to find the shortest path between any two road squares, which is the opposite of what is required. The problem description asks for the maximum number of moves, which would correspond to the longest path between any two road squares. However, the code implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach to find the shortest path, which will not achieve the desired result.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should implement an algorithm to find the longest path between any two road squares. One possible approach could involve finding the longest path using breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm, rather than the current DFS implementation.
