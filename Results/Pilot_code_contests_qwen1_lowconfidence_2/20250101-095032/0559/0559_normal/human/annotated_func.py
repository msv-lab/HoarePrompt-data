#State of the program right berfore the function call: coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing the coordinates of two road squares in the maze, where each coordinate is a tuple of two integers (row, column), and both coordinates are within the bounds of the maze (0 <= row < H and 0 <= column < W). depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping each road square coordinate to its initial depth, graph is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, and both depth_dict_org and graph are initialized before calling this function.
def func_1(coord1, coord2):
    depth_dict = depth_dict_org.copy()
    cur_coord = coord1
    end_coord = coord2
    cur_depth = 0
    used_coords = [coord1]
    childs = graph[coord1]
    while len(childs) != 0:
        cur_depth += 1
        
        next_childs = []
        
        used_coords += childs
        
        for child in childs:
            res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)
            if res == 'found':
                return cur_depth + 1
            next_childs += res
        
        childs = list(set(next_childs))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned (or the depth at which all possible paths were explored and no path to `end_coord` was found), `used_coords` is a list containing all coordinates visited during the search (including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates from `coord1` until the condition is met), `childs` is an empty list (since the loop terminates when `len(childs)` becomes 0), `next_childs` is also an empty list, and the final state reflects whether the shortest path was found or all paths were explored without finding a path to `end_coord`.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two coordinates `coord1` and `coord2` in a maze and attempts to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths from `coord1` to `coord2`. If a path is found, it returns the depth at which the path was found plus one (`cur_depth + 1`). If no path is found, it returns zero. The function maintains a list of used coordinates to avoid revisiting them and updates the `depth_dict` to reflect the current depth of exploration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: jibun is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze, target is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, and used_coords is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze.
def func_2(jibun, target, used_coords):
    childs = []
    for child in graph[jibun]:
        if child == target:
            return 'found'
        
        if child not in used_coords:
            childs.append(child)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including all coordinates that were added during the execution of the loop, `childs` is an empty list, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list. If `target` is found during the execution of the loop, the function returns 'found'. If `target` is not found and the loop completes without finding it, the function does not return anything.
    return childs
    #The program returns an empty list 'childs'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, and `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze. The function searches for the `target` coordinate from the `jibun` coordinate using the graph structure provided. If the `target` is found, the function returns 'found'. If the `target` is not found and the loop completes without finding it, the function returns an empty list `childs`. The `used_coords` set is updated to include all coordinates that were added during the execution of the loop.
