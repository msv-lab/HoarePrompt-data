coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing the coordinates of two road squares in the maze, where each coordinate is a tuple of two integers (row, column), and both coordinates are within the bounds of the maze (0 <= row < H and 0 <= column < W). depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping each road square coordinate to its initial depth, graph is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, and both depth_dict_org and graph are initialized before calling this function.
