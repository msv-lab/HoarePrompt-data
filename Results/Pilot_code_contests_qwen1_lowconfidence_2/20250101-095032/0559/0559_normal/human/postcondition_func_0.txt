The function `func_1` takes two coordinates `coord1` and `coord2` in a maze and attempts to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths from `coord1` to `coord2`. If a path is found, it returns the depth at which the path was found plus one (`cur_depth + 1`). If no path is found, it returns zero. The function maintains a list of used coordinates to avoid revisiting them and updates the `depth_dict` to reflect the current depth of exploration.
