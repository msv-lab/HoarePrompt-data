The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, and `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze. The function searches for the `target` coordinate from the `jibun` coordinate using the graph structure provided. If the `target` is found, the function returns 'found'. If the `target` is not found and the loop completes without finding it, the function returns an empty list `childs`. The `used_coords` set is updated to include all coordinates that were added during the execution of the loop.
