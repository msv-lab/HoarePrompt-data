The code converts the `next_childs` list into a set and then back into a list, removing any duplicate elements. Since `next_childs` is `'found'` (a string), converting it to a set and then back to a list will result in a list containing the string `'found'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`, and `next_childs` is `'found'`.**
