The code assigns the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` to the variable `res`. The values of `childs` and `next_childs` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`childs` has at least one element, `next_childs` is the original `next_childs` list appended with the value of `res`, `res` is equal to the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
