The code `childs = []` initializes an empty list named `childs`. This does not affect the values of `jibun`, `target`, or `used_coords`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze, and `childs` is an empty list.**
