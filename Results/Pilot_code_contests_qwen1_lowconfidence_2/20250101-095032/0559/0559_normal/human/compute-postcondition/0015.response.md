Postcondition: ***`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including the next `child`, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list. If `child` is equal to `target`, the function returns 'found'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., it continues the search).***
