Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two coordinates `coord1` and `coord2` in a maze and attempts to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths from `coord1` to `coord2`. If a path is found, it returns the depth at which the path was found plus one (`cur_depth + 1`). If no path is found, it returns zero. The function maintains a list of used coordinates to avoid revisiting them and updates the `depth_dict` to reflect the current depth of exploration.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `coord1` and `coord2` are valid and within the bounds of the maze.
- If the function does not find a path to `coord2`, it returns zero. This is a missing case handling that should be explicitly mentioned.
- The function does not handle the scenario where `coord1` and `coord2` are the same. In such a case, it should return 0 immediately since no exploration is needed.
- The function does not check if the graph (adjacency list) contains any entries for `coord1` or `coord2`, which could lead to errors if these coordinates do not exist in the graph.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid inputs such as non-tuple coordinates or non-integer values in the tuples.
