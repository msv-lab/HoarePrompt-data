To determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each `child` in `childs` and calls the function `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. If `func_2` returns `'found'`, the loop returns `cur_depth + 1`. Otherwise, the result of `func_2` is added to `next_childs`.

### Provided Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `cur_depth` is 1, `cur_coord` remains as `coord1`, `coord2` remains unchanged, `graph`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `used_coords`, `childs`, and `next_childs` (initially empty) are unchanged, `next_childs` becomes `[res]` and `res` is not `'found'`.
- After 2 iterations: `cur_depth` is 2, `cur_coord` remains as `coord1`, `coord2` remains unchanged, `graph`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `used_coords`, `childs`, and `next_childs` are unchanged, `next_childs` is `'found'`.
- After 3 iterations: `cur_depth` is 2, `cur_coord` remains as `coord1`, `coord2` remains unchanged, `graph`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `used_coords`, `childs` remain unchanged, `next_childs` is `'found3'`, and `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.

### Key Observations:
- The loop continues until `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` returns `'found'`.
- If `'found'` is returned, the loop immediately exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.
- If `'found'` is not returned, `next_childs` accumulates the results of `func_2`.

### Final State Determination:
- If `'found'` is never returned, the loop will continue indefinitely. However, the problem specifies that the output states show the loop executing up to a certain number of times, indicating that eventually, `'found'` is returned.
- When `'found'` is returned, the loop exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following:
- `cur_coord` remains as `coord1` throughout the loop.
- `coord2` remains unchanged.
- `graph`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `used_coords`, and `childs` remain unchanged.
- `next_childs` contains the final value when `'found'` is returned.
- `cur_depth` will be the depth at which `'found'` was returned, incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
**Output State: `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` is `graph[coord1]` and must be non-empty, `next_childs` is the path that led to `'found'`, and `next_childs` is `'found'`.**
