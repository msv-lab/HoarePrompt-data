Postcondition: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['found']`, `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`, `next_childs` is `[]`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, and `res` equals `'found'`**
