The code snippet appends the value of `child` to the list `childs`. The value of `child` is not explicitly defined in the snippet, but it is known that `child` is a coordinate since it is being added to a list of coordinates (`childs`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including `child`, `childs` is a list containing the coordinate `child`, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list.**
