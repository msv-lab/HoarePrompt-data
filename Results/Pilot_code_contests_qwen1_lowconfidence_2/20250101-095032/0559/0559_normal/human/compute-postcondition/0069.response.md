The code `next_childs += res` appends the value of `res` to the list `next_childs`. Based on the initial state, `next_childs` is originally a list and `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. If `res` equals 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`, otherwise, no specific action is taken regarding the return value. Since the exact value of `res` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact content after appending, but we know it is appended to `next_childs`.

Output State: **`childs` has at least one element, `next_childs` is the original `next_childs` list appended with the value of `res`, `res` is equal to the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, and `next_childs` is updated by appending `res`.**
