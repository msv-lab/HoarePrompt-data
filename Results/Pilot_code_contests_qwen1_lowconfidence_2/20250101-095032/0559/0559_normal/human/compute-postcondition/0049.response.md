### Analysis of Provided Code:

#### Initial State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found)`
- `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
- `next_childs` is an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found

#### Given Code:
```python
childs = list(set(next_childs))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `next_childs` is an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found.

2. **Effect of the Code:**
   - `next_childs` is converted to a set and then back to a list using `list(set(next_childs))`. This operation removes any duplicate elements in `next_childs`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - `next_childs` is now a list with unique elements.

### Output State:

- `cur_coord` remains `coord1`
- `coord2` remains the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` remains `coord2`
- `cur_depth` remains the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed
- `used_coords` remains `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found)`
- `childs` remains `[ 'not found' ]`
- `next_childs` is now a list of unique elements from the original `next_childs`

**Output State:**
```
cur_coord is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found), `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`, `next_childs` is a list of unique elements from the original `next_childs`.
