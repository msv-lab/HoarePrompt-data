You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing the coordinates of two road squares in the maze, where each coordinate is a tuple of two integers (row, column), and both coordinates are within the bounds of the maze (0 <= row < H and 0 <= column < W). depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping each road square coordinate to its initial depth, graph is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, and both depth_dict_org and graph are initialized before calling this function.
```
def func_1(coord1, coord2):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns cur_depth which is 1 plus 1, resulting in 2

Case_2: The program returns cur_depth that is 1 plus 1, which is 2

Case_3: The program returns 3

Case_4: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1

Case_5: `The program returns the value of cur_depth which is the depth at which 'not found' was returned plus 2`

Case_6: `The program returns cur_depth that is updated based on the value of res and incremented by 1`

Case_7: The program returns cur_depth plus 1, where cur_depth is the depth at which a child was found

Case_8: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is the current depth value before the increment

Case_9: `The program returns cur_depth plus 1, where cur_depth is the depth at the current recursion step`

Case_10: The program returns 0

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
