Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found)
- `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
- `next_childs` is a list of unique elements from the original `next_childs`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while len(childs) != 0:`

### Current State:
- The current state has `childs` as `[ 'not found' ]`, which means there are no child nodes to explore in the current iteration.

### Next Iteration Requirement:
For the loop to execute one more time, `len(childs)` must be non-zero at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `childs` currently contains only `['not found']`, we need to ensure that `next_childs` has at least one element before the loop can proceed to the next iteration.
- We don't need to adjust `cur_coord`, `coord2`, `graph`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `cur_depth`, `used_coords`, because these do not affect the length of `childs`.

### Updated State:
State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found), `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`, `next_childs` is a list containing at least one unique element from the original `next_childs`**

This ensures that `len(next_childs)` is non-zero, allowing the loop to continue executing.
