Postcondition: **`childs` has at least one element, `next_childs` is the original `next_childs` list appended with the value of `res`, `res` is equal to the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. If `res` equals 'found', the program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is the depth at the current recursion step. If `res` is not 'found', no specific action is taken regarding the return value.**
