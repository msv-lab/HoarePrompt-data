Postcondition: ***`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including `child`, `childs` is a list of integers, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list. If `child` is equal to `target`, the function returns 'found'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
