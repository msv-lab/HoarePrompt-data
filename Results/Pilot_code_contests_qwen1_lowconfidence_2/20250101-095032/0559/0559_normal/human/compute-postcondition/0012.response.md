Postcondition: ***`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including `child`, `childs` is a list containing the coordinate `child`, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list. If `child` is not in `used_coords`, the function continues without returning anything. If `child` is in `used_coords`, the function also continues without returning anything.***
