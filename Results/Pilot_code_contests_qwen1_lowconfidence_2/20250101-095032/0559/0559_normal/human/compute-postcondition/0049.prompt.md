You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Code:
```python
for child in childs:
    res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)
    if res == 'found':
        return cur_depth + 1
    next_childs += res
```

### Initial State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['found']`
- `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`
- `next_childs` is `[]`

### Analysis of Provided Output States:
1. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time:**
   - `cur_coord` is `coord1`
   - `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
   - `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
   - `end_coord` is `coord2`
   - `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 1
   - `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found']`
   - `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
   - `next_childs` is the concatenation of its original contents and `res`

2. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times:**
   - `next_childs` is increased by `res`
   - If `res` is `'found'`, then `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 2
   - Otherwise, `cur_depth` remains unchanged

3. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times:**
   - `next_childs` is modified to be its original value plus `res`
   - `cur_depth` remains unchanged

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `cur_depth` is initialized to the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1.
   - `used_coords` includes `coord1` and its reachable coordinates, ending with `'found'`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `childs`, which starts with `[ 'found' ]`.
   - For each `child`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
   - If `res` is `'found'`, the function returns immediately, setting `cur_depth` to `cur_depth + 1` and exiting the loop.
   - If `res` is not `'found'`, `res` is added to `next_childs`.

3. **Final Iteration:**
   - If the loop does not find `'found'` within `childs`, `next_childs` will contain all possible paths that did not lead to `'found'`.
   - `cur_depth` will be incremented by the number of times the loop did not find `'found'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If the loop does not find `'found'`, `cur_depth` will be incremented by the number of iterations until no more `child` values are available in `next_childs`.
   - `used_coords` will include all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found.
   - `childs` will be `[ 'not found' ]` after the loop, indicating no further children were found.
   - `next_childs` will be an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found.

### Final Output State:
- `cur_coord` remains `coord1`
- `coord2` remains the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` remains `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found)`
- `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
- `next_childs` is an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found

**Output State:**
```
cur_coord is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found), `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`, `next_childs` is an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found.
```
```
childs = list(set(next_childs))

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
