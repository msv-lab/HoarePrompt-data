Postcondition: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze, `childs` is a list of integers, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list. The coordinate `child` is not equal to `target`, and `child` is not in `used_coords`.**
