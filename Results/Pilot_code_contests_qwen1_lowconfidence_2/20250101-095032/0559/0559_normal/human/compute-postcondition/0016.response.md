`child` is appended to the list `childs`. The `jibun`, `target`, `used_coords`, and `graph[jibun]` variables are not affected by this operation. The value of `child` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including the next `child`, `childs` is a list containing `child`, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list.**
