The code sets `next_childs` to an empty list, which means all elements previously in `next_childs` are removed. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `next_childs` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the original value plus 1, `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found), `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`.**
