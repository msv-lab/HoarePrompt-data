The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `coord1` and `coord2`. Both `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing the coordinates of two road squares in the maze, where each coordinate is a tuple of two integers (row, column), and both coordinates are within the bounds of the maze (0 <= row < H and 0 <= column < W).

Based on the output cases provided, the function's return value depends on various conditions involving the depth at different stages of the search process. However, without the exact logic details, we can summarize the return values as follows:

- In some cases, the function returns a specific numerical value directly.
- In other cases, the function returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` could refer to the depth at various points during the execution of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`, which are tuples representing coordinates in a maze. Depending on the conditions within the function, it returns either a specific numerical value or `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` refers to the depth at certain stages of the function's execution.**
