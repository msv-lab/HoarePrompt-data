The function `func_2` is called with arguments `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`, and its return value is assigned to `res`. This affects the variables `res` and `cur_depth` (if `res` is not `'found'`). The value of `next_childs` is modified based on `res`, and `childs` must still contain elements.

Since the exact behavior of `func_2` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `res`. However, if `res` is not `'found'`, `cur_depth` will be updated. The value of `next_childs` is modified based on `res`, but we cannot specify the exact values without knowing the details of `func_2`.

Output State: **`next_childs` is modified based on `res`; if `res` is not `'found'`, `cur_depth` is updated; `childs` must still contain elements**
