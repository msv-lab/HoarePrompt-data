`next_childs` is assigned the value of `next_childs` plus `res`. Since `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and is not equal to 'found', the value of `next_childs` will be updated by adding the value of `res` to it. The initial elements in `childs` and the value of `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`childs` has at least one element added to it, `next_childs` is `childs` plus the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, and `res` is not equal to 'found'**
