According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over each `child` in `childs`. The state at the end of the previous iteration includes the value of `next_childs` and `cur_depth`, depending on the value of `res`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more children in `childs` to process. Therefore, the loop can execute again if `childs` still contains elements.

2. **Analyze the state modifications**:
   - If `res` is `'found'`, `next_childs` is increased by `res`.
   - If `res` is not `'found'`, `cur_depth` is updated to the current depth (`cur_depth`) plus 2.

Given the information from the end of the previous iteration:
- `next_childs` is increased by `res` if `res` is `'found'`.
- Otherwise, `cur_depth` is updated to `cur_depth + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `childs` must still contain elements (i.e., `len(childs) > 0`).
- If `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration, `next_childs` is already updated.
- If `res` was not `'found'`, `cur_depth` is updated to `cur_depth + 2`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`next_childs` is increased by `res` if `res` is `'found'`, and `cur_depth` is updated to `cur_depth + 2` if `res` is not `'found'`, `childs` must still contain elements**.

To express this concisely:
State: **`next_childs` is modified based on `res`, `cur_depth` is updated if `res` is not `'found'`, and `childs` must still contain elements**.
