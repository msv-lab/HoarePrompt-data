Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `childs` has at least one element.
   - `next_childs` is the original `next_childs` list appended with the value of `res`.
   - `res` is equal to the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `child` in `childs`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, `child` is taken from the `childs` list.
   - Inside the loop body, the function `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
   - The result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is stored in `res`.
   - `next_childs` is updated by appending the value of `res` to it.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `childs` must still have at least one element.
   - Since `next_childs` is updated with the value of `res`, it does not directly affect the condition for the loop to continue with `childs`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `childs` still has at least one element.

State: **`childs` has at least one element, `next_childs` is the original `next_childs` list appended with the value of `res`, and `res` is equal to the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` (unchanged for the next iteration).**

Given this, the key state to maintain for the loop to continue is that `childs` should still have at least one element.

State: **`childs` has at least one element, `next_childs` is the original `next_childs` list appended with the value of `res`, and `res` is equal to the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**.
