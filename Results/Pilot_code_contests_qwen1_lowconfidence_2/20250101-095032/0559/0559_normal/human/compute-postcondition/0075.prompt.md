You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing the coordinates of two road squares in the maze, where each coordinate is a tuple of two integers (row, column), and both coordinates are within the bounds of the maze (0 <= row < H and 0 <= column < W). depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping each road square coordinate to its initial depth, graph is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, and both depth_dict_org and graph are initialized before calling this function.
def func_1(coord1, coord2):
    depth_dict = depth_dict_org.copy()
    cur_coord = coord1
    end_coord = coord2
    cur_depth = 0
    used_coords = [coord1]
    childs = graph[coord1]
    while len(childs) != 0:
        cur_depth += 1
        
        next_childs = []
        
        used_coords += childs
        
        for child in childs:
            res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)
            if res == 'found':
                return cur_depth + 1
            next_childs += res
        
        childs = list(set(next_childs))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned (or the depth at which all possible paths were explored and no path to `end_coord` was found), `used_coords` is a list containing all coordinates visited during the search (including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates from `coord1` until the condition is met), `childs` is an empty list (since the loop terminates when `len(childs)` becomes 0), `next_childs` is also an empty list, and the final state reflects whether the shortest path was found or all paths were explored without finding a path to `end_coord`.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`, which are tuples representing coordinates in a maze. Depending on the conditions within the function, it returns either a specific numerical value or `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` refers to the depth at certain stages of the function's execution.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns cur_depth which is 1 plus 1, resulting in 2

Case_2: The program returns cur_depth that is 1 plus 1, which is 2

Case_3: The program returns 3

Case_4: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1

Case_5: `The program returns the value of cur_depth which is the depth at which 'not found' was returned plus 2`

Case_6: `The program returns cur_depth that is updated based on the value of res and incremented by 1`

Case_7: The program returns cur_depth plus 1, where cur_depth is the depth at which a child was found

Case_8: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is the current depth value before the increment

Case_9: `The program returns cur_depth plus 1, where cur_depth is the depth at the current recursion step`

Case_10: The program returns 0


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
