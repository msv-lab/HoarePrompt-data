Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, and `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze. The function searches for the `target` coordinate from the `jibun` coordinate using the graph structure provided. If the `target` is found, the function returns 'found'. If the `target` is not found and the loop completes without finding it, the function returns an empty list `childs`. The `used_coords` set is updated to include all coordinates that were added during the execution of the loop.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `jibun` does not exist in the graph, the function will raise a `KeyError` because `graph[jibun]` will not be defined. This is not covered in the current implementation and should be handled appropriately.
- The function does not update the `used_coords` set with the `jibun` coordinate itself before the loop starts, which could lead to incorrect results if `jibun` is not in the graph or if `jibun` is not a valid starting point.
- The function does not handle the case where `target` is not found and the function does not return anything (i.e., it falls off the end of the function without returning). This is addressed by the return statement `return childs`, ensuring that an empty list is always returned in such cases.
