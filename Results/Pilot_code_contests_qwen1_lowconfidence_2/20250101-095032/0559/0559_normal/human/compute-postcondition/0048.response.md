To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Code:
```python
for child in childs:
    res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)
    if res == 'found':
        return cur_depth + 1
    next_childs += res
```

### Initial State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['found']`
- `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`
- `next_childs` is `[]`

### Analysis of Provided Output States:
1. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time:**
   - `cur_coord` is `coord1`
   - `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
   - `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
   - `end_coord` is `coord2`
   - `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 1
   - `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found']`
   - `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
   - `next_childs` is the concatenation of its original contents and `res`

2. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times:**
   - `next_childs` is increased by `res`
   - If `res` is `'found'`, then `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 2
   - Otherwise, `cur_depth` remains unchanged

3. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times:**
   - `next_childs` is modified to be its original value plus `res`
   - `cur_depth` remains unchanged

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `cur_depth` is initialized to the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1.
   - `used_coords` includes `coord1` and its reachable coordinates, ending with `'found'`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `childs`, which starts with `[ 'found' ]`.
   - For each `child`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
   - If `res` is `'found'`, the function returns immediately, setting `cur_depth` to `cur_depth + 1` and exiting the loop.
   - If `res` is not `'found'`, `res` is added to `next_childs`.

3. **Final Iteration:**
   - If the loop does not find `'found'` within `childs`, `next_childs` will contain all possible paths that did not lead to `'found'`.
   - `cur_depth` will be incremented by the number of times the loop did not find `'found'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If the loop does not find `'found'`, `cur_depth` will be incremented by the number of iterations until no more `child` values are available in `next_childs`.
   - `used_coords` will include all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found.
   - `childs` will be `[ 'not found' ]` after the loop, indicating no further children were found.
   - `next_childs` will be an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found.

### Final Output State:
- `cur_coord` remains `coord1`
- `coord2` remains the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` remains `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found)`
- `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
- `next_childs` is an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found

**Output State:**
```
cur_coord is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found), `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`, `next_childs` is an empty list if `'found'` was never found, or a list of unexplored paths if `'found'` was not found.
