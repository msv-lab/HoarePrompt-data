To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the logic of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 1
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found']`
- `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
- `next_childs` is the concatenation of its original contents and `res`, where `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for child in childs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `cur_coord` is `coord1`
   - `coord2` is `coord1`
   - `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`
   - The loop iterates over `childs`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `childs`.

3. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `childs` is currently `[ 'not found' ]`
   - Since `childs` contains only one element `'not found'`, the loop does not execute because the condition `len(childs) > 0` is false.

### Next Iteration Analysis:
- To execute the loop again, `childs` must contain at least one valid child coordinate.
- `next_childs` is defined as the concatenation of the original `childs` and `res`.
- `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` for the current `child`.

Since `childs` currently contains only `'not found'`, it means no valid children were found in the previous iteration. Therefore, `next_childs` will also contain only `'not found'` unless `func_2` returns something other than `'not found'`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `next_childs` must contain at least one valid child coordinate. This implies that `func_2` must return a valid child coordinate when called with the appropriate parameters.

### Updated States:
- `cur_coord` remains `coord1`
- `coord2` remains `coord1`
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `depth_dict` remains unchanged
- `end_coord` remains `coord2`
- `cur_depth` remains the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 1
- `used_coords` remains `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found']`
- `childs` remains `[ 'not found' ]`
- `next_childs` becomes the concatenation of `['not found']` and `res` (where `res` is the valid child coordinate returned by `func_2`)

Given these conditions, we can conclude:

State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found']`, `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`, `next_childs` is the concatenation of its original contents and a valid child coordinate returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
