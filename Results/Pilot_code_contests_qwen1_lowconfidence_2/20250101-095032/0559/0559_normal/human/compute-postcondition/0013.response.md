Let's analyze the given code and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze**: This means `jibun` is a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph`.
- **`target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for**: We are looking for a specific coordinate.
- **`used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including `child`**: This means `child` is already in `used_coords`.
- **`childs` is a list containing the coordinate `child`**: This is redundant information since we already know `child` is in `used_coords`.
- **`graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list**: This means there are valid coordinates in the list associated with `jibun`.

### For Loop:
```
for child in graph[jibun]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each `child` in `graph[jibun]`.
- If `child` is not in `used_coords`, the function continues without returning anything.
- If `child` is in `used_coords`, the function also continues without returning anything.

Since we know from the given information that `child` is in `used_coords`, the function will continue without returning anything for this particular `child`.

### Next Iteration:
- **`jibun` remains the same**: It is still a valid coordinate in the maze.
- **`target` remains the same**: It is still the string representing the coordinate we are searching for.
- **`used_coords` remains the same**: It still contains all the coordinates that have already been visited, including `child`.
- **`graph[jibun]` remains the same**: It is still a non-empty list.

The only change needed is to adjust the `child` to the next element in the `graph[jibun]` list. Since `child` is the current element and it is in `used_coords`, the next `child` in the list will be considered.

### Updated State:
State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including the next `child`, `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list.**

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including the next `child`, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list.**
