The code assigns the result of the function call `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` to the variable `res`. However, the exact nature of the function `func_2` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `res`. The precondition that adding at least one element to the `childs` list is needed remains valid. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **We need to add at least one element to the `childs` list; `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
