`next_childs` is originally set to 'found'. The code `next_childs += res` updates `next_childs` by adding the value of `res` to its current value. Since `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, and if `res` equals 'found', the function returns 3. Therefore, `next_childs` will be updated to 'found' plus 3, which is 'found3'.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is 2, `cur_coord` remains as `coord1`, `coord2` remains unchanged, `graph`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `used_coords`, `childs` remains unchanged, `next_childs` is 'found3', `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
