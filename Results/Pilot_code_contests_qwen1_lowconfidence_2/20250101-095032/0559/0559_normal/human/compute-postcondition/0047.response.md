`next_childs` is incremented by `res`. If `res` is 'found', the function would return `cur_depth + 1`. However, since the code only updates `next_childs` without returning anything, the function continues its execution. The value of `cur_depth` remains unchanged unless the function returns it, which it does not in this case.

Output State: **`next_childs` is modified to be its original value plus `res`, `cur_depth` remains unchanged**
