Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited including all coordinates that were added during the execution of the loop, `childs` is an empty list, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list. If `target` is found during the execution of the loop, the function returns 'found'. If `target` is not found and the loop completes without finding it, the function does not return anything.**
