The code appends the `childs` list to `used_coords`. Initially, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where 'found' was not found)`, and `next_childs` is an empty list, so `childs` is also an empty list. Therefore, appending an empty list to `used_coords` does not change its value.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the original value plus 1, `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where 'found' was not found)`, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is an empty list.**
