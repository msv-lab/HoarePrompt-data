The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, and `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze.

The function has four possible return cases:
- Case_1: The program returns 'found'.
- Case_2: The program returns 'found'.
- Case_3: The program returns 'found'.
- Case_4: The program returns an empty list 'childs'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `jibun`, a string `target`, and a set `used_coords`, and return 'found' in some cases or an empty list 'childs' in another case.
