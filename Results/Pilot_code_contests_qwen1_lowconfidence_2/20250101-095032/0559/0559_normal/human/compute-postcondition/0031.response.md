The code `used_coords += childs` appends the elements of `childs` to `used_coords`. Given the initial state:

- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`
- `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`
- `next_childs` is `[]`

After executing `used_coords += childs`, `used_coords` will now include the elements of `childs` appended to its current list. Since `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`, the updated `used_coords` will be `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['found']`.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['found']`, `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`, and `next_childs` is `[]`**.
