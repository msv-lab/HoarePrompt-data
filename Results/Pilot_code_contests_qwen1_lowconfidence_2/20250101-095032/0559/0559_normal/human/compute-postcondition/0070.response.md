Output State: **`cur_depth` is the original value plus 1, `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where 'found' was not found)`, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is an empty list, and either `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` never returned 'found' and `next_childs` contains all possible paths from `cur_coord` to `end_coord` or `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` eventually returned 'found' and `cur_depth + 1` is the shortest path length from `cur_coord` to `end_coord`.**
