`cur_depth` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is the original value of `cur_depth` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned plus 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` is `[ 'found' ]`, and `next_childs` is not `'found'`**
