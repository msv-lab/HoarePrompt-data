Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'found'` was returned (or the depth at which all possible paths were explored and no path to `end_coord` was found), `used_coords` is a list containing all coordinates visited during the search (including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates from `coord1` until the condition is met), `childs` is an empty list (since the loop terminates when `len(childs)` becomes 0), `next_childs` is also an empty list, and the final state reflects whether the shortest path was found or all paths were explored without finding a path to `end_coord`.**
