Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze.
   - `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for.
   - `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze.
   - `childs` is a list of integers with an additional element `child`.
   - `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `child` in `graph[jibun]`.

3. **What Happens Inside the Loop:**
   - If `child` is not in `used_coords`, `child` is added to `used_coords`.
   - Otherwise, no change is made to `used_coords`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `child` is added to `used_coords` only if it is not already present, and assuming `child` is not in `used_coords` for the current iteration, `child` will be added to `used_coords`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `used_coords` will include `child`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `jibun` remains a valid coordinate in the maze (no change).
   - `target` remains a string representing the coordinate we are searching for (no change).
   - `used_coords` now includes `child` (add `child` to `used_coords`).
   - `childs` is no longer relevant as it was used to determine `child` but does not change after determining `child` for the current iteration.
   - `graph[jibun]` remains a non-empty list (no change).

Given this reasoning, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze including `child`, `childs` is a list of integers, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list.**
