`cur_depth` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `cur_depth` is the original value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the original value plus 1, `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where `'found'` was not found), `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`, `next_childs` is a list containing at least one unique element from the original `next_childs`.**
