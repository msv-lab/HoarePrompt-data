Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `childs`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `childs` is a non-empty list.

2. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `cur_depth` is the original value plus 1.
   - `cur_coord` is `coord1`.
   - `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`.
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate.
   - `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`.
   - `end_coord` is `coord2`.
   - `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where 'found' was not found)`.
   - `next_childs` is an empty list.
   - `childs` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `childs` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `childs` is currently an empty list, we need to ensure that `childs` is populated with at least one child before the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to add at least one element to the `childs` list.

State: **`cur_depth` is the original value plus 1, `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where 'found' was not found)`, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` must contain at least one element.**

This ensures that the loop will execute as it will iterate over at least one element in `childs`.
