`childs` is appended with the value of `child`. The value of `child` is not specified in the initial state but is known to be a coordinate that is not equal to `target` and not in `used_coords`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze, `childs` is a list of integers with an additional element `child`, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list.**
