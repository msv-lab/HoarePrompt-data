Postcondition: ***`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the maze, `target` is a string representing the coordinate we are searching for, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates that have already been visited in the maze, `childs` is a list of integers with an additional element `child`, and `graph[jibun]` is a non-empty list. If `child` is not in `used_coords`, `child` is added to `used_coords`. Otherwise, no change is made to `used_coords`.***
