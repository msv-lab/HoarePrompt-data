Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `childs` has at least one element added to it.
   - `next_childs` is `childs` plus the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.
   - `res` is not equal to 'found'.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each `child` in `childs`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `childs` must still contain at least one element.
   - `next_childs` is updated based on the current `childs` and the results of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` for each `child` in `childs`.
   - `res` remains unchanged as long as the loop continues, but once the loop exits, `res` could potentially change.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `childs` still contains at least one element for the loop to continue. Since `next_childs` is derived from `childs`, the number of elements in `next_childs` will depend on the results of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` for each `child` in `childs`. However, the key point is that `childs` should not be empty for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `childs` has at least one element, and `next_childs` is ready to be updated based on the function calls. `res` remains as it is until the loop completes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`childs` has at least one element, `next_childs` is `childs` plus the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` for each `child` in `childs`, and `res` is not equal to 'found'**.
