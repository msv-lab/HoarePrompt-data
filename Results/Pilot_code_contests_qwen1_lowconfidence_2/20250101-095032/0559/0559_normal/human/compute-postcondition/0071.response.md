The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` removes duplicates from `next_childs` and updates `childs` to contain only unique elements from `next_childs`. Since `next_childs` contains all possible paths from `cur_coord` to `end_coord` or includes the shortest path length from `cur_coord` to `end_coord`, removing duplicates does not change the essence of the values in `next_childs`.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the original value plus 1, `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found'] + (list of all explored coordinates up to the point where 'found' was not found), `next_childs` contains all possible paths from `cur_coord` to `end_coord` or includes the shortest path length from `cur_coord` to `end_coord`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, and we have removed any duplicate paths in `next_childs`.**
