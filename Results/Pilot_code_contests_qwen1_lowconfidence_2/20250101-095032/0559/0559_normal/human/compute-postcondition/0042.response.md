The code `next_childs += res` increments `next_childs` by the value of `res`. The value of `res` is determined by the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. If this function returns `'found'`, then `cur_depth` is set to the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 2. If it returns anything else, the postcondition remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 2, if the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is `'found'`.
- Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.

After the code execution:
- The value of `next_childs` is updated by adding `res` to its current value.
- If `res` is `'found'`, then `cur_depth` is updated to the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 2.
- If `res` is anything else, `cur_depth` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`next_childs` is increased by `res`, if `res` is `'found'` then `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 2, otherwise `cur_depth` remains unchanged.**
