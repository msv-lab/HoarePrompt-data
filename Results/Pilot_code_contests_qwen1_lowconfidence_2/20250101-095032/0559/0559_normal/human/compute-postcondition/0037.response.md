The code snippet `next_childs += res` appends the elements of the list `res` to the list `next_childs`. Since the exact values of `next_childs` and `res` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact combined values, but we know that `next_childs` will now contain all the elements of `res` appended to its current contents.

The output state will include the updated `next_childs` and the unchanged `cur_coord`, `coord2`, `graph`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `cur_depth`, `used_coords`, `childs`, and `res`.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord2` is the same tuple as `cur_coord`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are road square coordinates and values are lists of road square coordinates that are directly reachable from the key coordinate, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the depth at which `'not found'` was returned plus 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + ['not found']`, `childs` is `[ 'not found' ]`, `next_childs` is the concatenation of its original contents and `res`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
