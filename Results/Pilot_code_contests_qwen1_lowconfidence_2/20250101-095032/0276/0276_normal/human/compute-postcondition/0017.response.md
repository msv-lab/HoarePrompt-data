Postcondition: ***`encoding_str` is now equal to its original value plus the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`; `word_list` is a list of strings; `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator; `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements; `enc` is equal to the value returned by `func_1(enc)`. If `enc` is `False`, the function returns 'no'. Otherwise, the function does nothing.***
