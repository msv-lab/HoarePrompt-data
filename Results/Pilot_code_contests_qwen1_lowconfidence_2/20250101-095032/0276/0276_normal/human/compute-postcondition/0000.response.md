The code splits the `encoding` string at every occurrence of the substring `<3` and stores the resulting substrings in the `encoding_toks` list. This means that each element in `encoding_toks` is a word from the original message without the `<3` separator.

Given the initial state:
- `encoding` is a string containing Dima's encoded message, with words separated by `<3`.
- `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding.

After executing the line of code `encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')`, the `encoding_toks` list will contain the words from the original message, and the `word_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list of words from the original message (each word is a substring of `encoding` separated by `<3`), `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding.**
