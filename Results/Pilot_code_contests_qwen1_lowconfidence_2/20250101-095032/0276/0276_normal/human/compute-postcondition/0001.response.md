The code `''.join(word_list)` concatenates all the strings in the `word_list` into a single string, using no separator. This operation does not change the values of `encoding_toks` or `word_list`. The resulting string is assigned to `message_str`.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list of words from the original message (each word is a substring of `encoding` separated by `<3`), `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator.**
