`encoding_str` is appended with the value of `enc`. The initial state specifies that `encoding_str` is a non-empty string equal to its original value plus the current `enc`, and `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`. Since the value of `enc` is not specified but it is guaranteed to be returned by `func_1`, it means `encoding_str` will be updated to include this value.

Output State: **`encoding_str` is now equal to its original value plus the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`; `word_list` is a list of strings; `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator; `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements; `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`.**
