According to the code, the loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`. This means that `enc` takes the value of each element in `encoding_toks` starting from the second element (index 1) until just before the last element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `encoding_str` is now equal to its original value plus the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`.
- `word_list` is a list of strings.
- `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator.
- `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements.
- `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `enc` needs to be set to the next element in `encoding_toks` starting from index 2. Therefore, `enc` should be set to `encoding_toks[2]` if it hasn't reached the second-to-last element yet.

Given this, we need to check if there are enough elements in `encoding_toks` to continue the loop. Since `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, and the loop starts from index 1, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element after index 1.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `encoding_str` remains the same as it was after the previous iteration.
- `word_list` remains the same as it was after the previous iteration.
- `message_str` remains the same as it was after the previous iteration.
- `encoding_toks` must still have at least 3 elements to continue the loop.
- `enc` must be set to the next element in `encoding_toks`, which is `encoding_toks[2]`.

State: **`encoding_str` is now equal to its original value plus the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`; `word_list` is a list of strings; `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator; `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements; `enc` is `encoding_toks[2]`.**
