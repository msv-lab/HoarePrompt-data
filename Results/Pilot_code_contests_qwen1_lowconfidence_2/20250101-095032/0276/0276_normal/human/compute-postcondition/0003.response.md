To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `encoding_toks` is a list of words from the original message (each word is a substring of `encoding` separated by `<3`).
- `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding.
- `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator.
- `encoding_str` is an empty string.

### For Loop:
```
for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`. This means that the loop will only execute if there are more than 2 elements in `encoding_toks` (one element is excluded as the first one and another one is excluded as the last one).
2. **Initialization**: Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know the exact state changes inside the loop. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing, meaning `encoding_toks` should have at least 3 elements.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- Ensure that `encoding_toks` has at least 3 elements for the loop to execute. If `encoding_toks` has fewer than 3 elements, the loop will not run.

### Final State:
State: **`encoding_toks` is a list of words from the original message with at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_str` is an empty string**.

In summary:
State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_str` is an empty string**.
