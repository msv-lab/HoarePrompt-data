According to the code, the loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`. This means that `enc` takes each element from the slice of `encoding_toks` starting from the second element (index 1) to the second last element (index -1).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `encoding_str` is a non-empty string equal to its original value plus `enc`.
- `word_list` is a list of strings.
- `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator.
- `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements.
- `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The next value of `enc` must come from `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
- Since `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, we need to ensure that there are at least two elements left in the slice `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.

Let's denote the length of `encoding_toks` as `len(encoding_toks)`. Given that `len(encoding_toks) >= 3`, the number of elements in the slice `encoding_toks[1:-1]` would be `len(encoding_toks) - 2`.

For the loop to continue, `len(encoding_toks) - 2` must be at least 1, meaning `len(encoding_toks) >= 3` (which is already given) and the next `enc` should be the next element in the slice.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `encoding_str` remains the same as it is built during each iteration.
- `word_list` remains the same as it is built during each iteration.
- `message_str` remains the same as it is built during each iteration.
- `encoding_toks` must still have at least 3 elements.
- `enc` is now the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `enc` yet, but we know it comes from the slice `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`encoding_str` is a non-empty string equal to its original value plus the current `enc`, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`**.
