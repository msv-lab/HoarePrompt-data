The code `enc = func_1(enc)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(enc)` to the variable `enc`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state of the variable `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(enc)`, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`encoding_str` is now equal to its original value plus the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`; `word_list` is a list of strings; `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator; `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements; `enc` is equal to the value returned by `func_1(enc)`**
