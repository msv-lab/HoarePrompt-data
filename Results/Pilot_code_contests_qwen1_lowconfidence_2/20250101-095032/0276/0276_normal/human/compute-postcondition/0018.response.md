The code snippet `encoding_str += enc` updates the value of `encoding_str` by appending the value of `enc` to it. Based on the initial state, `enc` is equal to the value returned by `func_1(enc)`. 

Since `enc` can either be `False` (which would make `encoding_str += enc` equivalent to `encoding_str += 'no'`) or a non-`False` value (which would append the value returned by `func_1(enc)` to `encoding_str`), we need to consider both cases.

- If `enc` is `False`, then `encoding_str` is updated by appending `'no'` to its current value.
- If `enc` is not `False`, then `encoding_str` is updated by appending the value returned by `func_1(enc)` to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `encoding_str` is now equal to its original value plus the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`.
- `enc` is equal to the value returned by `func_1(enc)`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `enc`.

Output State: **`encoding_str` is now equal to its original value plus the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])` plus `'no'` if `enc` is `False`, or plus the value returned by `func_1(enc)` if `enc` is not `False`.**
