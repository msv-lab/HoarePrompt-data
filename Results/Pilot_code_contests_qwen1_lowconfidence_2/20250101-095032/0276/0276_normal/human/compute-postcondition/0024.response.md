The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `encoding`, which is a string containing Dima's encoded message where words are separated by "<3", and `word_list`, which is a list of strings representing the words from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding. 

Based on the given cases, the function returns 'no' in most scenarios and 'yes' in one specific scenario. However, without more detailed information about the exact conditions under which 'yes' is returned, we can only state the general behavior.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `encoding` and a list of strings `word_list`, and it returns 'yes' under certain conditions (not specified here) and 'no' in all other cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoding` and a list of strings `word_list`, and returns 'yes' under certain conditions and 'no' in all other cases.**
