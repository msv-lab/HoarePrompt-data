`enc` is reassigned to the value returned by `func_1(enc)`. The function `func_1` is applied to the current value of `enc`, which is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoding_str` is a non-empty string equal to its original value plus the current `enc`, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the value returned by `func_1(encoding_toks[1])`**
