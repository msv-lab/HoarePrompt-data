Postcondition: **`encoding_str` is the concatenation of the results of applying `func_1` to all elements of `encoding_toks` except the first and last elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)` in the final iteration, and `encoding_str` is not equal to `message_str`**
