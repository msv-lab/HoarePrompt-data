Output State: **`encoding_str` is the concatenation of the results of applying `func_1` to all elements of `encoding_toks` except the first and last elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)` in the final iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, meaning it processes each element of `encoding_toks` starting from the second element up to the second-to-last element.
- For each element `enc` in this range, `func_1(enc)` is applied.
- If `enc` is `False`, the function returns 'no', and otherwise, it appends the result of `func_1(enc)` to `encoding_str`.
- After all iterations, `encoding_str` will be the concatenation of the results of applying `func_1` to all elements of `encoding_toks` except the first and last elements.
- The variables `word_list`, `message_str`, and `encoding_toks` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The loop must have executed at least once for `encoding_toks` to have at least 3 elements. If `encoding_toks` has fewer than 3 elements, the loop would not execute at all.
