The code snippet `enc = func_1(enc)` modifies the value of `enc` by calling `func_1` on its current value. However, since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact new value of `enc`. We know that `enc` is assigned the result of `func_1(enc)`, which means the output of `func_1` is stored in `enc`.

The other variables (`encoding_toks`, `word_list`, `message_str`, and `encoding_str`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_str` is an empty string, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`**
