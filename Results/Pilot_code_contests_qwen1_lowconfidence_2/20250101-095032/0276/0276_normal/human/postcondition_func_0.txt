The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `string`, which is a potentially corrupted version of a correctly encoded message where each word is prefixed and suffixed by "<3". The function removes all non-alphabetic characters from the string, leaving only letters. This includes removing digits, punctuation marks, and special characters such as "less" (<) and "more" (>). The function returns a new string consisting solely of alphabetic characters. Potential edge cases include strings that contain no alphabetic characters or strings that consist entirely of special characters and digits. In such cases, the function will return an empty string.
