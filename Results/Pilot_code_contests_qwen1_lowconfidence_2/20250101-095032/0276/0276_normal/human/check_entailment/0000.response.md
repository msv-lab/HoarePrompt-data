Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded message contains extra characters that are not part of the words or the special "<3" delimiter. Specifically, Function 2 does not account for additional characters inserted by Dima between the words, which is a critical requirement according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3
```

In this case, the message should include additional characters like `&gt;3` and `&lt;3`, but the current implementation does not handle these correctly, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
