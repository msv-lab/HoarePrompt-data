Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle cases where Dima's encoded message contains digits or special characters other than the required "<3" delimiters. According to the problem description, Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message. The code only checks if the message can be reconstructed by removing non-alphabetic characters and comparing it to the original words. However, it does not account for the presence of digits or special characters within the words themselves.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
i3
lov3
y0u
&lt;3i3&lt;3lov3&lt;23y0u&lt;3
```

Expected output: "no"

However, the current implementation would incorrectly return "yes" because it only checks for the presence of "<3" and removes non-alphabetic characters, but it does not ensure that the digits and special characters within the words are correctly placed.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the digits and special characters within the words are correctly handled and not mistakenly removed.
