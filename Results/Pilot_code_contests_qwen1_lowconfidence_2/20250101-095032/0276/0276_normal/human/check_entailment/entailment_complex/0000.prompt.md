You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the "less" characters (<) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 105. 

The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 105. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less.

Output

In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3


Output

no

Note

Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    word_list = []
    for i in range(n):
        word_list.append(raw_input())
    encoding = raw_input()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, digits, and the signs "less" (<) and "more" (>), and it is a potentially corrupted version of a correctly encoded message where each word is prefixed and suffixed by "<3".
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))
    #''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string)) which removes all non-alphabetic characters from the string, leaving only letters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `string`, which is a potentially corrupted version of a correctly encoded message where each word is prefixed and suffixed by "<3". The function removes all non-alphabetic characters from the string, leaving only letters. This includes removing digits, punctuation marks, and special characters such as "less" (<) and "more" (>). The function returns a new string consisting solely of alphabetic characters. Potential edge cases include strings that contain no alphabetic characters or strings that consist entirely of special characters and digits. In such cases, the function will return an empty string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoding is a string containing Dima's encoded message, which consists of words separated by "<3". Each word is followed by "<3" except for the last word. word_list is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding.
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        
        encoding_str += enc
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `encoding_str` is the concatenation of the results of applying `func_1` to all elements of `encoding_toks` except the first and last elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)` in the final iteration.
    if (encoding_str == message_str) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    else :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters: `encoding`, a string representing Dima's encoded message where each word is separated by "<3", and `word_list`, a list of strings representing the original message words without any additional characters or encoding. The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into tokens using "<3" as the delimiter and then applies another function `func_1` to each token except the first and last ones. It constructs a new string `encoding_str` from these processed tokens. If `encoding_str` matches the `message_str` formed by concatenating all elements of `word_list`, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`. The function handles the case where `encoding_toks` has fewer than three elements by immediately returning `'no'`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
