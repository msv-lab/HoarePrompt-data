Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly handle the case where the encoded message has characters inserted randomly between the words. Specifically, the function `func_2` only checks if the concatenated words match the cleaned-up version of the encoded message, but it does not verify the positions of the "<3" markers or any other characters that might be inserted randomly. This means that if there are extra characters inserted anywhere in the encoded message, the function will incorrectly return "yes" even if the message was not encoded properly.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3randomchar
```

The correct encoded message would be `<3i<3love<3you<3`, but the presence of `randomchar` in the middle would make the message invalid. However, the current implementation would still return "yes" because the cleaned-up version of the encoded message (`iloveyou`) matches the concatenated words.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the positions of the "<3" markers and the order of the words are preserved correctly, even if there are other characters inserted in between.
