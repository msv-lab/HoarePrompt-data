Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to verify if a given text message has been correctly encoded according to the specified rules. Let's break down how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of words (`n`) and the list of words (`word_list`) from the input.
   - It then reads the encoded message (`encoding`) as a single string.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - The function `func_1` removes all non-alphabetic characters from a string, which is necessary because the encoding might include extra characters such as `<`, `>`, and digits.
   - This ensures that only the actual words remain when comparing with the original message.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - The function `func_2` splits the encoded message (`encoding`) by the delimiter `<3` to separate the words.
   - It then applies `func_1` to each word in the middle parts of the split message (excluding the first and last parts).
   - The resulting strings are concatenated and compared to the original message constructed from `word_list`.
   - If the two strings match, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation:**
   - The program assumes that the input is valid and will not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., negative `n`, empty lists, etc.). Since the problem description specifies that the input will be valid, this assumption is appropriate.

### Why the Program Meets the Problem Description:

- **Encoding Process:**
  - The program correctly simulates the encoding process by inserting `<3` before and after each word, and potentially adding random characters between the words.
  - By removing non-alphabetic characters and comparing the cleaned-up encoded message with the original words, the program verifies if the message could have been encoded correctly.

- **Comparison Logic:**
  - The logic in `func_2` ensures that even if there are extra characters inserted randomly between the words, the program can still validate the correctness of the encoding by focusing on the words themselves.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the assumptions made in the program, the annotated program correctly verifies whether the given text message is a correctly encoded version of the original message. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
