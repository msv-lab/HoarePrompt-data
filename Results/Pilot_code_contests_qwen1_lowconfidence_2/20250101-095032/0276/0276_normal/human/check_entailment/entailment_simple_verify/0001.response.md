Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the insertion of random characters into the encoded message. The function `func_2` only checks if the message without any additional characters matches the original message, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Specifically, the program should verify that the total number of characters in the encoded message (including the random characters) matches the length of the original message and that the structure of the message is maintained correctly. The current implementation does not account for these random characters, leading to incorrect validation of the encoded message. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is correct.
