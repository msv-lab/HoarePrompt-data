Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where Dima inserts additional characters between the words during encoding. According to the annotated version, the function `func_2` checks if the string obtained by removing non-alphabetic characters from the encoded parts matches the original message string formed by concatenating the words in `word_list`. However, it does not account for the additional characters that Dima can insert between the words, which is a crucial part of the problem description.

The annotated version confirms that the program only checks if the processed encoded parts match the original message without considering the extra characters, leading to incorrect results in cases where these extra characters are present. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is accurate.
