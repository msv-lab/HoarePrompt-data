Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle the random characters that Dima inserts into the encoded message. The `func_2` function only checks if the cleaned-up encoded message (after removing non-alphabetic characters) matches the original message, which ignores the random characters inserted by Dima. Therefore, the function cannot validate whether the encoded message was correctly formatted according to the problem description. The annotations confirm that the function does not account for the random characters, thus maintaining the original assessment of the program's incorrectness.
