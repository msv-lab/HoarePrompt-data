Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded message contains extra characters that are not part of the words or the special "<3" delimiter. Although the annotated code provides more detail, it confirms that `func_2` does not account for additional characters inserted by Dima between the words. This means the program cannot verify if the message was correctly encoded according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
