You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the "less" characters (<) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 105. 

The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 105. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less.

Output

In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3


Output

yes


Input

7
i
am
not
main
in
the
family
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3


Output

no

Note

Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))

#Function 2:
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        encoding_str += enc
    if encoding_str == message_str:
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded message contains extra characters that are not part of the words or the special "<3" delimiter. Specifically, Function 2 does not account for additional characters inserted by Dima between the words, which is a critical requirement according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3
```

In this case, the message should include additional characters like `&gt;3` and `&lt;3`, but the current implementation does not handle these correctly, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    word_list = []
    for i in range(n):
        word_list.append(raw_input())
    encoding = raw_input()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters, digits, and the signs "less" (<) and "more" (>), and it is a potentially corrupted version of a correctly encoded message where each word is prefixed and suffixed by "<3".
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))
    #''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string)) which removes all non-alphabetic characters from the string, leaving only letters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `string`, which is a potentially corrupted version of a correctly encoded message where each word is prefixed and suffixed by "<3". The function removes all non-alphabetic characters from the string, leaving only letters. This includes removing digits, punctuation marks, and special characters such as "less" (<) and "more" (>). The function returns a new string consisting solely of alphabetic characters. Potential edge cases include strings that contain no alphabetic characters or strings that consist entirely of special characters and digits. In such cases, the function will return an empty string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoding is a string containing Dima's encoded message, which consists of words separated by "<3". Each word is followed by "<3" except for the last word. word_list is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any additional characters or encoding.
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        
        encoding_str += enc
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `encoding_str` is the concatenation of the results of applying `func_1` to all elements of `encoding_toks` except the first and last elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is a string obtained by concatenating all elements of `word_list` without any separator, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)` in the final iteration.
    if (encoding_str == message_str) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    else :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters: `encoding`, a string representing Dima's encoded message where each word is separated by "<3", and `word_list`, a list of strings representing the original message words without any additional characters or encoding. The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into tokens using "<3" as the delimiter and then applies another function `func_1` to each token except the first and last ones. It constructs a new string `encoding_str` from these processed tokens. If `encoding_str` matches the `message_str` formed by concatenating all elements of `word_list`, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`. The function handles the case where `encoding_toks` has fewer than three elements by immediately returning `'no'`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
