Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle cases where the encoding string has an extra "<3" at the end. According to the problem description, the encoding should be in the format `<3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3`, and the last "<3" is mandatory. However, the current implementation checks only up to `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, which means it ignores the last token. This can lead to incorrect results if the encoding string has an extra "<3" at the end.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3&lt;3
```

The correct output should be "no" because the encoding string has an extra "<3" at the end, which the current implementation does not handle correctly.
