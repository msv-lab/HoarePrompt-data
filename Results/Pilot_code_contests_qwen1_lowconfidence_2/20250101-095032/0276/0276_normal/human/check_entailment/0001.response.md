Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the insertion of random characters (small English letters, digits, signs "more" and "less") into the encoded message. The function `func_2` only checks if the message without any additional characters matches the original message, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3hello&lt;3
```
The correct encoded message should include random characters inserted between the encoded parts, but the program will incorrectly validate this message as "yes" because it does not check for the presence of these random characters.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the random characters by checking if the total number of characters in the encoded message (including the random characters) matches the length of the original message. Additionally, it should verify that the positions of the hearts (`<3`) and the structure of the message are maintained correctly.
