Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle the random characters that can be inserted into the encoded message. The function `func_2` only checks if the message without any additional characters matches the original message, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function processes the encoded message but does not account for the random characters that can be inserted. Therefore, the program fails to validate the encoded message correctly, making the original assessment of False correct.
