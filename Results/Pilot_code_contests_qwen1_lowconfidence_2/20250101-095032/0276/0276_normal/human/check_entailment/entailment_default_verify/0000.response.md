Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided output hints and the original assessment, the program still does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` processes the encoded message by splitting it and removing non-alphabetic characters, but it does not account for additional characters that Dima might insert between the words, such as `<`, `>`, digits, and other symbols. The output hints confirm that `func_2` processes the tokens correctly but do not mention handling these extra characters. Since the problem requires the program to verify if the message could have been received by encoding in the specified manner, including handling the additional characters, the current implementation is insufficient. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
