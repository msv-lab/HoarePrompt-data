The function `func_2` takes two parameters: `encoding`, a string representing Dima's encoded message where each word is separated by "<3", and `word_list`, a list of strings representing the original message words without any additional characters or encoding. The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into tokens using "<3" as the delimiter and then applies another function `func_1` to each token except the first and last ones. It constructs a new string `encoding_str` from these processed tokens. If `encoding_str` matches the `message_str` formed by concatenating all elements of `word_list`, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`. The function handles the case where `encoding_toks` has fewer than three elements by immediately returning `'no'`.
