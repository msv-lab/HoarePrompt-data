The function processes an integer `n` where \(0 \leq n \leq 100\) and for each of the `n` lines, it reads two real numbers \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) representing the x and y coordinates of the i-th sticker. It then calculates all possible intersection points between pairs of stickers (if the distance between their centers is less than or equal to the square root of 2). For each intersection point, it counts how many stickers have their centers within a radius of \(1 + 10^{-12}\) from that point. Finally, it prints the maximum count of stickers that overlap at any single intersection point.
