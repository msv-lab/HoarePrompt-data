`cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. Since `cp1` is defined as `(x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3), y1 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3))` and the conditions `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0` are satisfied, `cp1` is added to the list `cross_points`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` with an additional element `cp1` appended, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.**
