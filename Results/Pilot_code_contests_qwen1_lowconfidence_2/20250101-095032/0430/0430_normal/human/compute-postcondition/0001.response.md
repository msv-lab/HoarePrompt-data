The code initializes two variables `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` with specific floating-point values. The values of these variables are directly assigned without depending on any previously defined variables like `n`, `xi`, or `yi`. The initial state of `n`, `xi`, and `yi` remains unchanged.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive.
2. There are `n` lines of input, each containing two real numbers `xi` and `yi`.
3. The code assigns `1 + 1e-12` to `RADIUS` and `2 + 1e-12` to `RADIUS_2`.

No variables in the initial state are altered by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains all the information from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100; the following n lines each contain two real numbers `xi` and `yi`, representing the x and y coordinates of the i-th sticker; `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12; `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12.**
