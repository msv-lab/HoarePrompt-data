Let's break down the given information and think through the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `num_data`
   - `j` is 0
   - `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
   - `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
   - `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(num_data):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = num_data - 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `num_data` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `num_data` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - Since `j` starts at 0, it will iterate as long as `j < num_data`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_data` is at least 1.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` is `num_data`
   - `j` is 0 (remains unchanged as it starts the loop)
   - `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data` (remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state)
   - `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data` (remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state)
   - `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` (remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state)
   - `num_data` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute

Therefore, the final state needed to ensure the loop executes is:
State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `num_data` must be greater than 0**
