`cross_points.append(cp1)` appends `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp1` is determined based on the conditions described in the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, `cp2`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `cp1` is appended to `cross_points`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is calculated by `math.acos(distance)`, `cp2 = (x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`**
