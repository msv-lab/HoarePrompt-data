Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) with \(cp1\) and \(cp2\) appended to the list if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\), `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `al` is `math.acos((\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`, `cp2` is `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`**
