The code `x1, y1 = data[i]` assigns the elements at index `i` in the list `data` to the variables `x1` and `y1`. However, the value of `i` (which is `num_data`) is used as the index, and the values of `x1` and `y1` will be the elements at index `num_data` in the `data` list. The values of `j` and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `x1` is the element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the element at index `num_data + 1` in `data`**
