Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments to the program state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information
1. **`num_data`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num\_data} \leq 100\).
2. **`RADIUS`**: \(1 + 1e-12\).
3. **`RADIUS_2`**: \(2 + 1e-12\).
4. **`data`**: A list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values.
5. **`cross_points`**: A list containing at least two tuples of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\).
6. **`max_overlap`**: Equal to the original value of `count`.
7. **`count`**: Equal to the original value of `count` plus 1 if the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement
```
for (x, y) in data:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the list `data`. Since `data` contains exactly `num_data` tuples, the loop will run `num_data` times in total.

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - **`x` and `y`**: These are the values from the tuples in `data` and are updated in each iteration.
   - **`count`**: This variable is incremented by 1 if the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

### Adjusting the States
At the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- **`x` and `y`**: These will be updated to the next tuple in the list `data`.
- **`count`**: Depending on the condition, `count` will either remain the same or increase by 1.

Since the loop will continue as long as there are tuples left in `data`, the only thing that changes between iterations is the values of `x` and `y`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. At the end of the last iteration, let's say the current tuple `(x, y)` was processed.
2. The next tuple in `data` will be used in the next iteration.

### Final State
- **`x` and `y`**: Will be the values of the next tuple in `data`.
- **`count`**: Will be the value of `count` at the end of the previous iteration, unless the condition was met and `count` was incremented.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num\_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least two tuples of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` is equal to the original value of `count`, and `count` is equal to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration or incremented by 1 if the condition was met. The values of `x` and `y` will be the next tuple in the list `data`.**
