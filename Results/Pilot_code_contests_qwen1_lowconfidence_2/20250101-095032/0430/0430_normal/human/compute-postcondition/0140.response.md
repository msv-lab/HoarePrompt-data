The code updates the value of `cp1` by calculating its new coordinates using the formula for rotation around a point. Specifically, `cp1` is updated to be the point `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `th` is defined as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is defined as `math.pi / 3`.

Thus, `th + al` becomes `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3`.

Therefore, the updated value of `cp1` is:
- `cp1[0] = x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3)`
- `cp1[1] = y1 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3)`

Other variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.pi / 3`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3), y1 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3))`.**
