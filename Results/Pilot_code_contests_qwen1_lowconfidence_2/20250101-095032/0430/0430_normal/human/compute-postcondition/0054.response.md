Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. If `i == j`, the loop simply moves to the next iteration without any change to the values of the variables. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
