Postcondition: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`**
