According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `num_data`. The initial values given are `i` is `num_data`, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `x1` is the element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `y1` is the element at index `num_data + 1` in `data`.

For the loop to execute, the variable `j` must be within the valid range for the `range` function. Specifically, `j` must be less than `num_data`.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- `j` must be less than `num_data` for the loop to execute.

Since `j` is initially set to `num_data - 2`, this condition is already satisfied, and no further adjustment is needed for `j`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_data` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`num_data` must be greater than 0**
