The code calculates the angle `th` using the `math.atan2` function, which computes the arctangent of `y2 - y1` over `x2 - x1`. This does not change the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, or `j`. However, `th` is now assigned the computed angle.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is assigned the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and `th` is math.atan2(`y2 - y1`, `x2 - x1`). The distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and `(x1, y1)` is not equal to `(x2, y2)`**
