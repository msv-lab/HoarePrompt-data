The code assigns the values of `data[i]` to `x1` and `y1`. Since `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are set to the first tuple in the list `data`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num_data` must be greater than 0, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `data`.**
