Let's break down the given state and the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `num_data` must be greater than 0.
   - `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12.
   - `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12.
   - `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values.
   - `cross_points` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `data`.
   - `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `data`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop runs for each value of `j` from `0` to `num_data - 1`. 

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute, the loop variable `j` must satisfy the condition `0 <= j < num_data`. 
   - Since `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, the loop will run as long as `j` is less than `num_data`.
   - Therefore, `num_data` must be at least `1` (since `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `num_data - 1`).

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `num_data` is at least `1` for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `num_data` must be at least 1.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.

**State:**
**`num_data` must be at least 1, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `data`.**
