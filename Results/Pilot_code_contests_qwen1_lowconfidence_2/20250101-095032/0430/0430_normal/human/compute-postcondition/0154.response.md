The code updates the values of `x2` and `y2` by setting them to the third and fourth elements at index `num_data` in the `data` list, respectively. The `distance` variable is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using the `math.hypot` function. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) with \(cp1\) and \(cp2\) appended to the list if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\), `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\).**
