Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num_data \leq 100\).
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\).
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\).
   - `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values.
   - `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\).
   - `max_overlap` remains 0.
   - `count` is increased by 1 if the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true. Otherwise, the values of `num_data`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `data`, `cross_points`, `max_overlap`, and `count` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (x, y) in data:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple \((x, y)\) in the `data` list.
   - For each iteration, the loop body (which is omitted here) checks the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`.
   - If the condition is true, `count` is incremented by 1.
   - If the condition is false, no changes are made to `num_data`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `data`, `cross_points`, `max_overlap`, and `count`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the `data` list, the number of elements in `data` (`num_data`) and the list itself (`data`) will remain unchanged as long as the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is not met for all elements.
   - `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, and `cross_points` will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified in the loop body.
   - `max_overlap` remains 0 because it was mentioned that it does not change in the given conditions.
   - `count` will be incremented if the condition is true for any \((x, y)\).

Since the loop body is not provided, we assume that the loop continues as long as there are elements in the `data` list. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `count`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `num_data` remains the same.
   - `RADIUS` remains \(1 + 1e-12\).
   - `RADIUS_2` remains \(2 + 1e-12\).
   - `data` remains the same list of exactly `num_data` tuples.
   - `cross_points` remains the same list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points.
   - `max_overlap` remains 0.
   - `count` is increased by 1 if the condition is met for any \((x, y)\).

State: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num_data \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` remains 0, and `count` is increased by 1.**
