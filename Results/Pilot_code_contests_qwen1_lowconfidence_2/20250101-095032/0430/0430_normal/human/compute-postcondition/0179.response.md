The code snippet appends `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp2` is determined based on the conditions provided. Since `cp2` is derived from `cp1` and depends on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `th`, and `al`, we need to ensure those values remain consistent.

Let's break down the relevant parts:
- `cp2` is calculated as \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{sin(th - al)})\).
- `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\).
- `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\).

Given these conditions, the list `cross_points` now includes the newly added `cp2`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points with `cp2` appended if `cp2` is within the range [0.0, 10.0] for both coordinates, `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both equal to \((x1, y1)\). Otherwise, `cp2` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{sin(th - al)})\) where `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\) and `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\).**
