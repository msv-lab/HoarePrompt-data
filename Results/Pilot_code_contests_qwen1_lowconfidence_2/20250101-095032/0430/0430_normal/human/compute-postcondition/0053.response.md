The `continue` statement in the code causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration without executing any further statements within the current iteration. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values within the scope of the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. The loop moves to the next iteration.**
