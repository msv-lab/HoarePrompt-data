The code `cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1` assigns the tuple `(x1, y1)` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Since `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `x2` and `y2` were previously assigned from `data[j]`, the values of `cp1` and `cp2` will be the same as the values of `x1` and `y1`, which in turn are equal to `x2` and `y2`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `cp1` and `cp2` will be `(x2, y2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is assigned the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, the distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `cp1` is `(x2, y2)`, and `cp2` is `(x2, y2)`.**
