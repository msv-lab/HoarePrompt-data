`continue` is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the code does not change the values of `i` or `j`. The `continue` statement here does not have any effect because it is outside of a loop context.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `j`. `i` and `j` are integers.**
