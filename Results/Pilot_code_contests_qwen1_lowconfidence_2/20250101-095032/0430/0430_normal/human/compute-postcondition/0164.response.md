Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points. If both coordinates of `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `cp2` is included in `cross_points`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cp2` and `cross_points` remains unchanged.***
