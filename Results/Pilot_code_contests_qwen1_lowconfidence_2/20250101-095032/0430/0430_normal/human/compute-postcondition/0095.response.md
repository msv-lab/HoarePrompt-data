Postcondition: ***`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` equals `x2`, `y1` equals `y2`, `cp1` is either `x2, y2` or a point calculated using trigonometric functions depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` or not, `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`, and the `cross_points` list contains both `cp1` and `cp2` unless `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, in which case it only contains `cp1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the same as the if part.***
