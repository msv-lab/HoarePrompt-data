The code appends `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. From the initial state, we know that `cp1` is either \((x1, y1)\) if \(x1 == x2\) and \(y1 == y2\), or \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th + al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th + al)})\) otherwise. Since the exact values of `th` and `al` depend on the coordinates, we will keep them in their general form.

The output state will reflect the addition of `cp1` to the list `cross_points` without changing the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points with `cp1` appended, `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both equal to \((x1, y1)\). Otherwise, `cp1` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th + al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th + al)})\) and `cp2` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th - al)})\), where `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\) and `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\).**
