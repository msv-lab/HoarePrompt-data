Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\). If `distance` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `cp2` is appended to `cross_points` with the condition that both coordinates of `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], and if `cp2` is within the specified range, `cp2` is updated to \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{sin(th - al)})\); otherwise, `cp2` remains unchanged.***
