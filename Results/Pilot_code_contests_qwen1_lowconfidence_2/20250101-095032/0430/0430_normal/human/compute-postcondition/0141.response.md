The code snippet updates the value of `cp2` using the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Let's break down the process:

1. `th` is defined as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
2. `al` is defined as `math.pi / 3`.
3. The new value of `cp2` is calculated as `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

Given these, the new coordinates for `cp2` are:

- The x-coordinate of `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al)`.
- The y-coordinate of `cp2` is `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.pi / 3`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3), y1 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))**.
