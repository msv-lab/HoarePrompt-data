The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of the variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if inside a loop) and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the only valid interpretation is that this `continue` statement is outside any loop, which means it does not affect any variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`num_data` must be greater than 0, i equals j**
