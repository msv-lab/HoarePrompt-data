The code updates the value of `cp2` to `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`. Given the initial state, the value of `cp2` changes according to this new expression. All other variables remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `cp2` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`, `cross_points` is unchanged, `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
