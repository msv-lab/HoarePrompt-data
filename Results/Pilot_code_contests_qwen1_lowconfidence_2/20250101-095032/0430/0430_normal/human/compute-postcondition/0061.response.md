The code snippet updates the value of `cp2` based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Let's break it down:

1. `cp1[0]` is defined as `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`.
2. `cp1[1]` is defined as `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.
3. `cp2` is defined as `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

Given these definitions, we can directly update the value of `cp2` based on the current values of `th` and `al`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `cp2[0]` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al)`.
- `cp2[1]` is `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance`, `cp1[0]` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`, `cp1[1]` is `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2[0]` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al)`, `cp2[1]` is `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.
