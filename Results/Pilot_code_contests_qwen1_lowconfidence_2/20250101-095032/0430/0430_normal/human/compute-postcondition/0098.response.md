The code assigns `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Given the initial state, `x1` is `j + 1` and `y1` is `i`. Since `i` is `j + 1`, `y1` is also `j + 1`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `cp1` and `cp2` will both be `(j + 1, j + 1)`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `distance`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` is `j + 1`, `y1` is `j + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - (j + 1))`, `cp1` is `j + 1, j + 1`, `cp2` is `j + 1, j + 1`**
