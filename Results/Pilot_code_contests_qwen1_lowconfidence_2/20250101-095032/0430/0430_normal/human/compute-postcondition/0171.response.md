The code `cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1` assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. The previous values of `x1` and `y1` are unchanged, and the values of other variables (`i`, `j`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`) are also not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)**.
