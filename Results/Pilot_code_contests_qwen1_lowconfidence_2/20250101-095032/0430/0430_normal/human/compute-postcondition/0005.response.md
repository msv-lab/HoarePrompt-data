The code appends a tuple of float values to the list `data`. The tuple is created by converting each string in the input line (split by commas) into a float. Since the initial state of `num_data` is a positive integer, `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), and `data` is an empty list, the code will add one tuple to `data`.

Let's denote the input line as `s` which contains comma-separated values. After the code is executed, `data` will contain one tuple with these float values.

Output State: **`num_data` is a positive integer, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing one tuple of float values**
