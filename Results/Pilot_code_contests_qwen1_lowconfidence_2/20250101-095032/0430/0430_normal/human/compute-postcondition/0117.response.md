The code updates the value of `cp1` based on the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. Specifically, `cp1` is updated to be `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Let's break this down:

1. `cp1` was previously calculated based on the relative positions and distances but now gets updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.
2. `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al` retain their previous values.

Thus, the output state is as follows:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `x1` is `num_data`
- `y1` is `num_data`
- `x2` is `data[j][0]`
- `y2` is `data[j][1]`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `cp1` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`
- `cp2` remains as it was calculated before
- `cross_points` remains unchanged
- `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is as calculated before, `cross_points` is unchanged, `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
