The code `x2, y2 = data[j]` updates the values of `x2` and `y2` by assigning the first and second elements of `data[j]` to `x2` and `y2`, respectively. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `distance`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and the values of `i` and `data` remain unchanged.**
