The provided code snippet does not actually perform any operations on the variables. It is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would modify the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100; the following n lines each contain two real numbers xi and yi, representing the x and y coordinates of the i-th sticker. Each coordinate value is given with up to 6 digits after the decimal point.**
