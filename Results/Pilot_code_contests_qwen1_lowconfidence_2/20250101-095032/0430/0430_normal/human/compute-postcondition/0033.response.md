The code appends the tuple `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp2` is `(`x1 + math.cos(th - al)`, `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`). Since `cross_points` already contains the tuple `cp2` because `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, appending it again does not change the list `cross_points`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th - al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`, and `cross_points` contains the tuples `[cp2]`.
