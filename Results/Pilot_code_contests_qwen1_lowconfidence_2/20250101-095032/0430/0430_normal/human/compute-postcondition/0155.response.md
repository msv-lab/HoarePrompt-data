The code assigns `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Specifically, `cp1` and `cp2` are set to the coordinates `(x1, y1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\).**
