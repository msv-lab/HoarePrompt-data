The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Given the initial conditions, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`. Therefore, `cp1` and `cp2` will both be set to `(x1, y1)`.

The output state will reflect this change, while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `cp1` is `(x1, y1)`, `cp2` is `(x1, y1)`.**
