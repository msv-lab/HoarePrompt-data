Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` equals `j`
- `x1` equals `x2`
- `y1` equals `y2`
- `cp1` is either `x2, y2` or a point calculated using trigonometric functions depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` or not.
- `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`.
- The `cross_points` list contains both `cp1` and `cp2` unless `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, in which case it only contains `cp1`.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `j < num_data`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` equals `j` (assuming `i` was initialized to 0 at the start of the loop).
- `x1` equals `x2`.
- `y1` equals `y2`.
- `cp1` is either `x2, y2` or a point calculated using trigonometric functions depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` or not.
- `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`.
- The `cross_points` list contains both `cp1` and `cp2` unless `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, in which case it only contains `cp1`.

### Next Iteration:
- Since `i` equals `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will equal `j + 1`.
- The conditions for `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` remain the same as they depend on the values derived during the loop body, which are not specified but are consistent with the previous state.
- `cp1` and `cp2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j` and the updated distance.
- The `cross_points` list will be updated accordingly.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be `j + 1` (assuming `i` was `j` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `x1` remains the same.
- `y1` remains the same.
- `cp1` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j`.
- `cp2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j` and the updated distance.
- The `cross_points` list will be updated based on the new values of `cp1` and `cp2`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` equals `x2`, `y1` equals `y2`, `cp1` is either `x2, y2` or a point calculated using trigonometric functions depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` or not, `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`, and the `cross_points` list contains both `cp1` and `cp2` unless `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, in which case it only contains `cp1`.**

This is the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
