According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. If `num_data` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_data` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must be at least 2.

Therefore, we adjust the state as follows:

State: **`num_data` is at least 2, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing two tuples**
