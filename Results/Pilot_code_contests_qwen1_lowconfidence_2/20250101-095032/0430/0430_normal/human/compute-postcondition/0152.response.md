Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) with \(cp1\) and \(cp2\) appended to the list if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\), `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\). Since the if condition `i == j` is true (with `i = num_data` and `j = 1`), the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
