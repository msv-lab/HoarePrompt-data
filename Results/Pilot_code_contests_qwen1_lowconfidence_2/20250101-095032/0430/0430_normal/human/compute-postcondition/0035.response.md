Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th - al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`, and `cross_points` contains the tuples `[cp2]` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.***
