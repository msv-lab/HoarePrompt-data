The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using the `math.hypot` function. This distance is assigned to the variable `distance`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`) are not affected.

The distance calculation is given by:
\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)**.
