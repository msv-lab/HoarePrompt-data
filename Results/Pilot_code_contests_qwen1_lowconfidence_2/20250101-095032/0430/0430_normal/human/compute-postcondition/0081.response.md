The code `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` uses the `math.atan2` function to compute the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `x1` and `y1`. Since these values are not provided, they remain undefined in the context of this calculation. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `num_data` is greater than 0
- `i` equals `j`
- `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(data[i][0] - data[j][0], data[i][1] - data[j][1])`
- The distance between the points `data[i]` and `data[j]` is greater than `RADIUS_2`

The only new variable assigned a value is `th`, which is the angle calculated using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. Since `x1` and `y1` are not defined, the output state will reflect that `th` is now assigned the result of `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, but the exact numerical value cannot be determined without the values of `x1` and `y1`.

Output State: **`num_data` is greater than 0, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[i][0] - data[j][0], data[i][1] - data[j][1])`, and the distance between the points `data[i]` and `data[j]` is greater than `RADIUS_2`; `th` is the result of `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.**
