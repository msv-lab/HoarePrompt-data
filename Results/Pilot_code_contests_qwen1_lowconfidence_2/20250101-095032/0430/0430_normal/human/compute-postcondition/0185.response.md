Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary states for the loop to execute:

1. **`num_data`**: The variable `num_data` is between 0 and 100 inclusive. This determines the length of the `data` list. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in the `data` list because the loop iterates over each tuple.

2. **`RADIUS`**: This value is 1 + 1e-12 and does not affect the loop's execution directly.

3. **`RADIUS_2`**: This value is 2 + 1e-12 and also does not affect the loop's execution directly.

4. **`data`**: The `data` list contains exactly `num_data` tuples of float values. Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `cross_points`, `cross_points` must be non-empty for the loop to execute.

5. **`cross_points`**: This list contains valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` generated by the loop. For the loop to execute, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.

6. **`max_overlap`**: This value is initially 0 and does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given these considerations, we need to ensure that `cross_points` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `cross_points` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`num_data` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `num_data` ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `max_overlap` is 0.**

Final State: **`num_data` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `num_data` ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `max_overlap` is 0**.
