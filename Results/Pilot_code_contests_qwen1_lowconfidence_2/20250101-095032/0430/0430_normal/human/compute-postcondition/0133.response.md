The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. This distance is stored in the variable `distance`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`**.
