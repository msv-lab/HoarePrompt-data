Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, then if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `cp2` is appended to `cross_points`. Otherwise, the values of `cp2` remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part's condition satisfied.***
