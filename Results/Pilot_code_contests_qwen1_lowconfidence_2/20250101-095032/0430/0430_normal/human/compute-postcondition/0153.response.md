The code assigns the values from `data[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `x2` will take the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `y2` will take the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) with \(cp1\) and \(cp2\) appended to the list if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\), `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\). After executing the code, `x2` is now the third element at index `num_data` in `data` and `y2` is now the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`.**
