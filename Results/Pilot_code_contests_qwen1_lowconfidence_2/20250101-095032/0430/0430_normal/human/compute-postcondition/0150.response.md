According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `num_data`. If `j` is less than `num_data`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `j` is 0
- `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) with \(cp1\) and \(cp2\) appended to the list if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\)
- `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) with \(cp1\) and \(cp2\) appended to the list if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\), `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\)**.
