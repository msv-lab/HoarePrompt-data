Postcondition: ***`i` equals `j`, `x1` equals `x2`, `y1` equals `y2`, `cp1` is either `x2, y2` (if `distance <= RADIUS_2`) or a point calculated using trigonometric functions (if `distance > RADIUS_2`), `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`, and `cross_points` contains `cp1` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, and `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated using trigonometric functions, and `cross_points` contains both `cp1` and `cp2`.***
