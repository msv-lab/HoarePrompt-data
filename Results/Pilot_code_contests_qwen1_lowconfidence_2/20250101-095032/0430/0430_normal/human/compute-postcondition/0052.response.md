According to the code, the loop iterates over `range(num_data)`, meaning `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `num_data`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `i` is an integer.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`.
- If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, then if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `cp2` is appended to `cross_points`. Otherwise, the values of `cp2` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `num_data`. Since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` must now be the original value of `j + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` remains the same integer.
- `j` is now the original value of `j + 1`, so `j` is the original `j` value (not `j + 1`).
- `x2` will be the first element of `data[j]`.
- `y2` will be the second element of `data[j]`.
- `distance` will be the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`.

State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`**
