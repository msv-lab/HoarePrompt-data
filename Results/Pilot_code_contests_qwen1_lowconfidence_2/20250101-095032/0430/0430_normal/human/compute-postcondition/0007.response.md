`data` is a list containing one tuple of float values. The code reads a line from standard input, splits it by commas, and converts each string to a float, then appends this new tuple to the `data` list. Since the initial state specifies that `data` contains one tuple, after executing the code, `data` will contain two tuples.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 1, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing two tuples**
