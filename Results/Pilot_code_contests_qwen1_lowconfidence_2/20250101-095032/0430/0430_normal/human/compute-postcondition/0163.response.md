The code `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Since `cross_points` was initially a list of all valid intersection points and `cp2` is only added to this list if its coordinates are within the range [0.0, 10.0], the addition of `cp2` does not change the fact that `i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `cross_points` remains a list of all valid intersection points, including the newly appended `cp2`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, including the newly appended `cp2`.**
