The code simply prints the value of the variable `max_overlap`. Since the print statement does not assign any new value to any variable, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the output of the program.

Output State: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{num_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing tuples of valid intersection points \((cp1, cp2)\) where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), and `max_overlap` is the maximum number of points in `data` that are within the radius `RADIUS` from any point in `cross_points`. The value of `max_overlap` is printed.**
