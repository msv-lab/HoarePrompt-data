The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution simply moves to the next line after this statement. The variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, and the current value of `i` is equal to `j`.**
