`count` is incremented by 1. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The previous condition determining whether `count` is `max_overlap + 1` or `max_overlap` remains valid.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are the next tuple from the `data` list, `count` is either `max_overlap + 1` + 1 or `max_overlap` + 1 depending on the condition in the previous iteration.**
