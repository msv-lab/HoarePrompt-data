The code appends `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. Since `cp1` is defined as `(x1, y1)` in the initial state, appending it to `cross_points` will add this tuple to the list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is equal to `(x1, y1)`, `cp2` is equal to `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`. If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both equal to `(x1, y1)`, and `cross_points` is now a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1)`.**
