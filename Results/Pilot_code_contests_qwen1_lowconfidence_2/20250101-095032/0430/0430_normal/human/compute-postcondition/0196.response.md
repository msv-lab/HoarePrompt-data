Postcondition: ***`num_data` remains the same, `RADIUS` remains \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` remains \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` remains the same list of exactly `num_data` tuples, `cross_points` remains the same list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points, `max_overlap` remains 0, and `count` is increased by 1 if the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is met for any \((x, y)\).***
