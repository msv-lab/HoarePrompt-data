The code calculates the value of `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. Here, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. The formula used is derived from the law of cosines for a triangle with sides `distance`, `distance`, and `distance`, which simplifies to `al = math.acos(1/2)`. 

Given that `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and the formula simplifies to `math.acos(1/2)`, we know that `al` will be the angle whose cosine is `1/2`, which is `math.pi / 3` radians.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.pi / 3`**
