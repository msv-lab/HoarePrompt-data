Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` with an additional point `cp1` appended to the list. If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, `cp1` is kept as is; otherwise, no change is made to `cross_points`. `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. The current value of `cp2` satisfies `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`***
