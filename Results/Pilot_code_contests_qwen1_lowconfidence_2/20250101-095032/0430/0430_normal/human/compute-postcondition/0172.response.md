The code `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` computes the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from point `(x1, y1)` to point `(x2, y2)`. This angle is stored in the variable `th`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\)**.
