The code calculates the angle (in radians) using the `math.atan2` function, which computes the arc tangent of `y2 - y1` over `x2 - x1`. This does not directly change the values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, or `distance`, but it assigns the calculated angle to `th`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`**.
