`num_data` is assigned the value of the first line read from `stdin`, which is converted to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `num_data` is an integer read from stdin, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12.**
