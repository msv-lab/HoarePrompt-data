According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `num_data`. The loop condition for the `for` loop is `range(num_data)`, meaning it will iterate from 0 to `num_data - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num_data` is a positive integer.
- `RADIUS` is set to `1 + 1e-12`.
- `RADIUS_2` is set to `2 + 1e-12`.
- `data` is a list containing one tuple of float values.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must be greater than the current number of iterations. Since we don't know the exact value of `num_data`, but we know it is a positive integer, the loop can continue if `num_data` is greater than 0.

If the loop is to execute one more time, `num_data` must be at least 1 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `num_data` must be at least 1. The other variables (`RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

State: **`num_data` is at least 1, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing one tuple of float values**
