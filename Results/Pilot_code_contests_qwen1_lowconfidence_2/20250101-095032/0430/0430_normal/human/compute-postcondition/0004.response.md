Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(num_data)`, which means the loop will run as long as `num_data` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Identify Necessary Variables**: The loop will depend on two main variables:
   - `num_data`: This is the number of iterations the loop will perform.
   - `_`: A dummy variable used for iterating through the range of `num_data`.

3. **Analyze Given States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\). This value does not directly affect the loop execution.
   - `num_data` is an integer read from stdin. For the loop to execute, `num_data` must be a positive integer (since `range(0)` results in an empty sequence).
   - `RADIUS` is set to `1 + 1e-12`.
   - `RADIUS_2` is set to `2 + 1e-12`.
   - `data` is an empty list, which does not directly affect the loop execution but will be modified within the loop.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `num_data` must be a positive integer. It should not be zero or negative.
   - The dummy variable `_` will be incremented by the loop itself and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.
   - `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` remain constant and do not affect the loop's execution.
   - `data` remains empty and will be populated during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `num_data` is a positive integer.

The final state adjustment required is:

**State: **`num_data` is a positive integer, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is an empty list**.
