Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` with `cp1` and `cp2` appended to the list if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, these values remain unchanged and `cross_points` is updated accordingly. If `distance > RADIUS_2`, these values remain unchanged and `cross_points` remains as previously updated (if any).***
