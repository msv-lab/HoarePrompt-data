Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_data} \leq 100\).
   - `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\).
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\).
   - `data` is a list containing at least two tuples of float values.
   - `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\).
   - `max_overlap` is the value of `count` from the last loop iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `data` list.

3. **Loop Body Analysis**:
   - For each tuple `(x, y)` in `data`, the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, then `count` is updated to `max_overlap + 1`.
   - If the condition is false, `count` remains `max_overlap`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The state is not explicitly given, but we need to assume the loop has just completed its previous iteration. Letâ€™s denote the current state before entering the loop as follows:
     - `x` and `y` are the current values being processed from the `data` list.
     - `count` is the number of times the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` was satisfied during the previous iteration.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, the loop will take the next tuple `(x, y)` from the `data` list.
   - The `count` for the next iteration will depend on whether the condition is satisfied or not.

6. **Updated State**:
   - `x` and `y` will be the next values from the `data` list.
   - `count` will be either `max_overlap + 1` if the condition was satisfied or `max_overlap` if it was not.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `x` and `y` will be the next tuple from the `data` list.
- `count` will be `max_overlap + 1` if the condition was satisfied in the previous iteration, or `max_overlap` if it was not.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` and `y` are the next tuple from the `data` list, `count` is either `max_overlap + 1` or `max_overlap` depending on the condition in the previous iteration.**
