Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points. If `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0] for both coordinates, they remain unchanged and included in `cross_points`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cp1` and `cp2`.***
