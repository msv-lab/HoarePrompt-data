The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Given that `x1` equals `x2` and `y1` equals `y2`, and knowing the initial values of `x2` and `y2`, we can directly assign these values to `cp1` and `cp2`.

Here are the steps:
- `cp1` is assigned the value of `x1`, which is `x2`.
- `cp2` is assigned the value of `x1`, which is also `x2`.
- Similarly, `cp1` is assigned the value of `y1`, which is `y2`.
- `cp2` is assigned the value of `y1`, which is also `y2`.

So, the values of `cp1` and `cp2` are updated to be `(x2, y2)`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is greater than 0, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[i][0] - data[j][0], data[i][1] - data[j][1])`, the distance between the points `data[i]` and `data[j]` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `x1` equals `x2`, `y1` equals `y2`, `cp1` equals `x2, y2`, `cp2` equals `x2, y2`**
