Postcondition: ***`i` equals `j`, `x1` equals `x2`, `y1` equals `y2`, `cp1` is either `x2, y2` (if `distance <= RADIUS_2`) or a point calculated using trigonometric functions (if `distance > RADIUS_2`), `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`, and `cross_points` contains both `cp1` and `cp2` (unless `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, in which case it only contains `cp1`).***
