The code assigns the tuple `(x1, y1)` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. This means that the values of `cp1` and `cp2` are now the same as `x1` and `y1`. The values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`**
