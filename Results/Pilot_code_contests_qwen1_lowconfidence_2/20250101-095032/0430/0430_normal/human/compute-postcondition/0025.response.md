`al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. The value of `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, which is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and `(x1, y1)` is not equal to `(x2, y2)`. Therefore, the value of `al` depends on the value of `distance`. Since `distance` is a Euclidean distance, it is calculated as `sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)`. However, the exact value of `al` cannot be simplified without knowing the exact value of `distance`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is assigned the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and `th` is math.atan2(`y2 - y1`, `x2 - x1`), `al` is math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))**
