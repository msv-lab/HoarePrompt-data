The code snippet `x1, y1 = data[i]` assigns the value of `data[i][0]` to `x1` and the value of `data[i][1]` to `y1`. Here, `i` is `num_data`, so `x1` is updated to the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `y1` is updated to the second element at index `num_data` in `data`. The values of `j`, `cross_points`, `i`, and `num_data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop**
