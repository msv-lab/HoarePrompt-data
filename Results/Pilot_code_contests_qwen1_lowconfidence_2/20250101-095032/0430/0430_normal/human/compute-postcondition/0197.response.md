Output State: **`num_data` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `num_data` ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `max_overlap` remains 0, and `count` is the total number of tuples \((x, y)\) in `data` for which the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple \((x, y)\) in the list `data`.
- For each tuple, the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is checked.
- If the condition is true, the `count` variable is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations of the loop, `count` will reflect the total number of tuples \((x, y)\) in `data` that satisfy the given condition.
- The values of `num_data`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `data`, `cross_points`, and `max_overlap` do not change during the loop execution.
