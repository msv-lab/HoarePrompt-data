Postcondition: ***`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing at least two tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` is the value of `count` from the last loop iteration. If the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true, then `count` is `max_overlap + 1`. Otherwise, `count` remains `max_overlap`.***
