Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points with `cp1` appended if `cp1` is within the range [0.0, 10.0] for both coordinates. `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both equal to \((x1, y1)\). Otherwise, `cp1` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th + al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th + al)})\) and `cp2` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th - al)})\), where `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\) and `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\).***
