Postcondition: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num\_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least two tuples of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` is the maximum value of `count` during the loop execution, `count` is the total number of points in `data` that satisfy the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`, and the condition `max_overlap < count` is true**
