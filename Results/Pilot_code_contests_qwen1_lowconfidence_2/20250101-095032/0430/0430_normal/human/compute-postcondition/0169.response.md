The code `x2, y2 = data[j]` assigns the values from the list `data` at index `j` to the variables `x2` and `y2`. Given that `j` is 2, `x2` will be the third element in the list `data`, and `y2` will be the fourth element in the list `data`.

The initial states of the variables are:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `j` is 2
- `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points

Since the if condition `i == j` is not met (as `i` is `num_data` and `j` is 2, and `num_data` is not specified but is not equal to 2), the else part is not executed, meaning the variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged.

After executing the code, the new states are:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `j` is 2
- `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points
- `x2` is the third element at index `j` in `data`
- `y2` is the fourth element at index `j` in `data`

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`.**
