The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Given the initial states, `x1` and `y1` are both `num_data`. The values of `cp1` and `cp2` are updated to these values. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is `num_data`, `cp2` is `num_data`, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
