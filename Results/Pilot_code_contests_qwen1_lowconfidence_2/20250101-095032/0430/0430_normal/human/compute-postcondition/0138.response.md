The code calculates the angle `th` using the `math.atan2` function with the differences in y-coordinates and x-coordinates between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, and `th` is assigned the result of `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`**.
