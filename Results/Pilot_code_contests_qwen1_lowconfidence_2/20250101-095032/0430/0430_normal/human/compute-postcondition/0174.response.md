The code calculates the coordinates of a new point `cp1` using the formulas for cosine and sine applied to the angle `th + al`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `th` is the angle calculated as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
2. `al` is calculated as `math.acos((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2) / (2.0 * sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2))`.
3. `cp1` is then calculated as:
   - `x` coordinate: `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`
   - `y` coordinate: `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`

Since the exact numerical values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are not specified, we'll keep them in their symbolic form. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index 2 in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index 2 in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\), `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\), `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`**
