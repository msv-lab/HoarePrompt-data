`x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of the elements at index `j` in the list `data`. Given that `j` is equal to `i` (as per the initial state), `x2` and `y2` will be the third and fourth elements of `data` respectively (since `x1` and `y1` are the first and second elements at index `num_data`).

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, and `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data` and `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`.**
