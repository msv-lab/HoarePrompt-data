`cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp1` depends on whether `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`. Based on the initial state, this condition is not specified, so we will consider the general case where `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `j` is 1
- `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points

The value of `cp1` is calculated as:
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / distance)`
- `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`

Since `cp2` is not appended to `cross_points` in the given code, we only focus on `cp1`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `cross_points` will have the value of `cp1` appended to it.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points including `cp1` where `cp1 = x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.acos(distance / distance))`**
