The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It is expected to process a series of coordinates defined within its scope, where the number of coordinates `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100. For each of these `n` lines, the function reads two real numbers `xi` and `yi`, representing the x and y coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker. Each coordinate value is given with up to 6 digits after the decimal point.

Given the provided information, the function will handle these coordinates but the specific operations or return values are not detailed in the prompt. However, based on the parameter constraints and the nature of the problem, we can infer that the function processes these coordinates in some way (e.g., calculating distances, checking conditions, etc.), but without further details, we focus solely on the input and output specifications.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` where 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each of the `n` lines, it reads two real numbers `xi` and `yi` representing the x and y coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker. The function returns no direct value from the function body itself but operates on the provided coordinates.**
