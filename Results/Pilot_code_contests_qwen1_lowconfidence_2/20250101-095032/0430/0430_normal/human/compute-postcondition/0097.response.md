The code calculates the distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` using the formula `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. Here, `x1` is `j + 1`, `y1` is `i`, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values at index `j` of the `data` list, and the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `cp1`, and `cp2` are no longer directly relevant to the current state.

After the code executes, the new values of `x2` and `y2` are stored from the `data` list, and the distance is computed. However, since the actual values of `x2` and `y2` from the `data` list are not provided, we can only express the distance in terms of these values.

Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` is `j + 1`, `y1` is `i`, `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`, distance is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - i)**
