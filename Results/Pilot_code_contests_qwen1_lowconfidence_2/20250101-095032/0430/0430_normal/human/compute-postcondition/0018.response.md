The code assigns the values from the tuple `data[j]` to the variables `x2` and `y2`. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `data[j]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `x2` and `y2`, but we know they are assigned the values from the tuple at index `j`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is assigned the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `data[j]`**
