State: **`num_data` must be greater than 0, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The for loop runs from `i` starting at 0 up to `num_data`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `num_data` must be greater than 0. If `num_data` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.
3. The initial value of `i` should be set to 0 since the loop starts iterating from `i=0`.
4. The other variables (`RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `data`, and `cross_points`) do not affect whether the loop can execute, but they are part of the program state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num_data` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
