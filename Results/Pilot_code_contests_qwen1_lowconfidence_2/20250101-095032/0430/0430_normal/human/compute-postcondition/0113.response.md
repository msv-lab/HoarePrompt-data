The code updates the value of `distance` to be the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. This calculation does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain as in the initial state.

The initial state provides us with the following:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `x1` is `num_data`
- `y1` is `num_data`
- `x2` is `data[j][0]`
- `y2` is `data[j][1]`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - num_data, y2 - num_data)`
- `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances
- `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged

After executing the line of code, the only change is that `distance` is now updated to the new value `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
