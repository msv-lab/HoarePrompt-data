The code calculates the new coordinates `cp1` based on the current position `(x1, y1)`, the angle `th + al`, and the trigonometric functions `cos` and `sin`. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, and `th` remain unchanged. The new coordinates `cp1` are updated as follows:

- `cp1[0] = x1 + math.cos(th + al)`
- `cp1[1] = y1 + math.sin(th + al)`

Since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `cp1[0]` and `cp1[1]`. However, we know that `cp1` is now defined as these expressions.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is the angle calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is calculated by `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1[0] = x1 + math.cos(th + al)`, `cp1[1] = y1 + math.sin(th + al)`**
