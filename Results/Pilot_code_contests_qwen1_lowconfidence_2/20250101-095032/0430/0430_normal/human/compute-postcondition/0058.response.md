The code calculates the angle `th` using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. This function returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.**
