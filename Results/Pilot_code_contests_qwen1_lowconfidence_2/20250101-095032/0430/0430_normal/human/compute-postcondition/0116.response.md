Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes several variables:
   - `i` is `num_data`
   - `x1` is `num_data`
   - `y1` is `num_data`
   - `x2` is `data[j][0]`
   - `y2` is `data[j][1]`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
   - `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances
   - `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged
   - `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`

2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```python
   al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))
   ```

3. Let's determine the impact of this code:
   - `al` is assigned the value `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.
   - This expression involves `distance`, which is already defined as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
   - The function `math.acos` calculates the arc cosine of the argument, which in this case is `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)`.

Given these points, let's calculate the value of `al`:

- Since `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, we substitute this into the expression:
  \[
  al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(\frac{\mathbf{distance}^2}{2.0 \cdot \mathbf{distance}}\right)
  \]

- Simplifying the argument inside the `math.acos` function:
  \[
  \frac{\mathbf{distance}^2}{2.0 \cdot \mathbf{distance}} = \frac{\mathbf{distance} \cdot \mathbf{distance}}{2.0 \cdot \mathbf{distance}} = \frac{\mathbf{distance}}{2.0}
  \]

- So, `al` is:
  \[
  al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(\frac{\mathbf{distance}}{2.0}\right)
  \]

4. The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged, `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
