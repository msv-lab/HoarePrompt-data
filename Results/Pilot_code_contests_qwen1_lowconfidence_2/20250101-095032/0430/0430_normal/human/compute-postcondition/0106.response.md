The code appends `cp2` to the `cross_points` list. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `cp1` and `cp2`, we will keep them as they are, assuming that `cp2` is a valid point that meets the conditions for appending. The initial conditions for `cross_points` are not specified, so we assume it is initialized as an empty list before this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `j + 1`
- `x1` is `j + 1`
- `y1` is `i`
- `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - i)`
- `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances as described
- If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.

After the code `cross_points.append(cp2)` is executed:
- `cp2` is appended to the `cross_points` list, regardless of the content of `cp1`.

Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` is `j + 1`, `y1` is `i`, `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - i)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances as described, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2`.**
