Output State: **`num_data` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `num_data` ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` generated by the loop that satisfy the conditions within the loop, where `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0].**
