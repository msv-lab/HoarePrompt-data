Output State: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num\_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least two tuples of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` is the maximum value of `count` during the loop execution, and `count` is the total number of points in `data` that satisfy the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `data` list.
- For each iteration, if the point `(x, y)` satisfies the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`, the `count` variable is incremented.
- After all iterations, `count` will be the total number of points in `data` that satisfy the condition.
- Since the loop increments `count` based on the condition being met, `max_overlap` will be the highest value `count` attained during the loop's execution. However, if no points in `data` meet the condition, `count` will remain `0` and `max_overlap` will also be `0`.

Given that the loop can execute at most `num_data` times (as there are exactly `num_data` tuples in the `data` list), the final values of `num_data`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `data`, `cross_points`, and `max_overlap` are as stated above. The value of `count` will reflect the total number of points satisfying the condition, and `max_overlap` will be the highest such count achieved during the loop.
