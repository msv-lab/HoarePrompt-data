Postcondition: **`num_data` is greater than 0, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[i][0] - data[j][0], data[i][1] - data[j][1])`, and the distance between the points `data[i]` and `data[j]` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`**
