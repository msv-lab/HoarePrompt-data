Postcondition: ***`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` is `j + 1`, `y1` is `i`, `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - i)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances as described, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.***
