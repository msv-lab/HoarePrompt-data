Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `num_data`
   - `j` is 1
   - `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
   - `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
   - `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `num_data - 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `num_data`.
   - Currently, `j` is 1, so for the next iteration, `j` needs to be 2.

4. **Variables to Adjust**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop condition.
   - `j` must be incremented to 2.
   - `x1` and `y1` will now refer to the elements at index `num_data` in `data`, but since `j` is changing, these values remain the same for the next iteration.

5. **State of `cross_points`**:
   - The value of `cross_points` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to `cross_points`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points.**
