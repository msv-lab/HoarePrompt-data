Output State: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` is the maximum value of `count` from all loop iterations, and the values of `data`, `cross_points`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, and `max_overlap` remain unchanged. If the current position \((cx, cy)\) satisfies the condition \(math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) \leq RADIUS\) for any tuple \((x, y)\) in `data`, then `count` will be incremented for each such tuple, otherwise `count` remains `0`.**
