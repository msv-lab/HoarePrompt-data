According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `num_data`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `j` is `num_data - num_data`, which simplifies to 0
- `x1` is the last element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `y1` is the element at index `num_data + 1` in `data`
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `num_data`. However, since `i` is already equal to `num_data`, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, no changes are needed in the states for the loop to execute one more time because the condition `i < num_data` is not met.

State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the last element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the element at index `num_data + 1` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop**
