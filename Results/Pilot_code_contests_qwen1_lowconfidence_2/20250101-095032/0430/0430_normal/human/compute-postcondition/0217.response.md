Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num_data`: An integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_data} \leq 100\).
   - `RADIUS`: \(1 + 1e-12\).
   - `RADIUS_2`: \(2 + 1e-12\).
   - `data`: A list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values.
   - `cross_points`: A list containing at least two tuples of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\).
   - `max_overlap`: The value of `count` from the last loop iteration.
   - `count`: The total number of points in `data` that satisfy the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(cx, cy)` in `cross_points`.
   - The loop body processes each point `(cx, cy)` and updates `count` based on the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `(cx, cy)` from `cross_points` needs to be processed.
   - Since `cross_points` contains at least two tuples, the loop can continue as long as there are more tuples to process.

4. **Updating States:**
   - `cx` and `cy` will be set to the next tuple in `cross_points`.
   - `count` will be updated based on the new tuple `(cx, cy)`.
   - `max_overlap` will be updated if the new `count` is greater than the current `max_overlap`.

5. **New State After the Next Iteration:**
   - `num_data` remains unchanged since it is determined by the size of `data`.
   - `RADIUS` remains \(1 + 1e-12\).
   - `RADIUS_2` remains \(2 + 1e-12\).
   - `data` remains the same list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values.
   - `cross_points` now contains one fewer tuple since one tuple has been processed.
   - `max_overlap` will either remain the same or be updated to the new `count` depending on the condition.
   - `count` will be the updated value based on the new tuple `(cx, cy)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `cx` and `cy` will be the next tuple in `cross_points`.
- `count` will be updated based on the new tuple `(cx, cy)`.
- `max_overlap` will be updated if the new `count` is greater than the current `max_overlap`.

State: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` is the value of `count` from the last loop iteration, and `count` is the total number of points in `data` that satisfy the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`. If `max_overlap < count` is true, then `max_overlap` is updated to `count`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
