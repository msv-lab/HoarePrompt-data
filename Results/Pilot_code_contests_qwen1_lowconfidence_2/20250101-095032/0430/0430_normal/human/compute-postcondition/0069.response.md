To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop:

### Given Information:
- The loop runs over `range(num_data)`, meaning it iterates from `0` to `num_data - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is an integer.
  - `j` is `num_data - 1`.
  - `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`.
  - `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`.
  - `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`.
  - `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
  - `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.
  - `cp1` is equal to `(x1, y1)` if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, otherwise `cp1` is equal to `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
  - `cp2` is equal to `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`, otherwise `cp2` is also equal to `(x1, y1)`.
  - `cross_points` is a list containing the tuples `(x1, y1)` and `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if `0.0 <= (x1 + math.cos(th - al)) <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= (y1 + math.sin(th - al)) <= 10.0`. `cross_points` may also contain the tuples `[cp2]` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `num_data - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `i` should still be within the range `0` to `num_data - 1`.

2. **Current Values**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer.
   - Since `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` must be `num_data - 1` to reach this state.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes `num_data`.
   - This means `j` should be updated to `num_data - 1 - 1 = num_data - 2`.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be incremented to `num_data`.
- `j` will be updated to `num_data - 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is num_data, `j` is num_data - 2**.

Note: The values of `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, `cp1`, `cp2`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged as they depend on the specific elements of `data` and the geometric calculations which do not change with the loop iteration unless explicitly updated inside the loop body.
