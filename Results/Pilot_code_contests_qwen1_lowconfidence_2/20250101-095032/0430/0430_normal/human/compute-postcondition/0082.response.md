The code `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` updates the variable `al` by calculating the arccosine of the expression `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)`. Given that `distance` is already defined, this calculation will produce a specific value for `al`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `distance` is defined in the initial state as `math.hypot(data[i][0] - data[j][0], data[i][1] - data[j][1])`, which calculates the Euclidean distance between points `data[i]` and `data[j]`.
2. The expression `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)` simplifies to `distance / 2.0`.
3. The variable `al` is then assigned the value of `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

Since `distance` is a specific value calculated from the points `data[i]` and `data[j]`, `al` will also be a specific value resulting from the `math.acos` function applied to `distance / 2.0`.

Output State: **`num_data` is greater than 0, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[i][0] - data[j][0], data[i][1] - data[j][1])`, and the distance between the points `data[i]` and `data[j]` is greater than `RADIUS_2`; `th` is the result of `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**.
