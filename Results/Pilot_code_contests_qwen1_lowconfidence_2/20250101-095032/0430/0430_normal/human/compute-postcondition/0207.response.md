Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine the necessary adjustments.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num\_data} \leq 100\).
- `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\).
- `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values.
- `cross_points` is a list containing at least two tuples of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\).
- `max_overlap` is equal to `count`.
- `count` is `1`.

### For Loop:
```
for (x, y) in data:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `data` list. The loop body is omitted, but we know it checks a condition involving `RADIUS` and updates `count`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `data` list.
   - Each tuple `(x, y)` corresponds to a point in a 2D space.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS)` needs to be evaluated.
   - If this condition holds, `count` is incremented by 1.
   - If the condition does not hold, `count` remains unchanged.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `count` was initially `1`, and it only increments if the condition is met, the possible values for `count` after the first iteration could be either `1` or `2`.
   - However, without knowing the exact value of `cx` and `cy`, we cannot definitively say how many times the condition was met. Therefore, we consider both possibilities.

4. **List Adjustments**:
   - The list `data` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The list `cross_points` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify it.

5. **Count Value**:
   - Since the loop has just started, the new value of `count` could be `1` if the condition did not hold, or `2` if the condition held for at least one point.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the state should reflect the updated value of `count` and the unmodified lists.

State: **`num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num\_data} \leq 100\), `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\), `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least two tuples of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\), `max_overlap` is equal to `count`, and `count` is either `1` or `2` (depending on the condition check).**
