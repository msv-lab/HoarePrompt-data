The code `x2, y2 = data[j]` updates the values of `x2` and `y2` to the values at index `j` of the `data` list. The other variables (`i`, `cp1`, `cp2`, `x1`, `y1`, `cross_points`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` equals `x2`, `y1` equals `y2`, `cp1` is either `x2, y2` or a point calculated using trigonometric functions depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` or not, `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`, and the `cross_points` list contains both `cp1` and `cp2` unless `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, in which case it only contains `cp1`. The values of `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values at index `j` of the `data` list.**
