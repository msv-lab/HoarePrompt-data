Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `i` is `num_data`
   - `j` is 2
   - `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
   - `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
   - `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points
   - `x2` is the third element at index 2 in `data`
   - `y2` is the fourth element at index 2 in `data`
   - `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)
   - `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\)
   - `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\)
   - `cp1` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th + al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th + al)})\)

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   cp2 = x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)
   ```

3. This code creates a new tuple `cp2` where the x-coordinate is `x1 + math.cos(th - al)` and the y-coordinate is `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

4. The variables `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, and `cp1` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is `num_data`
- `j` is 2
- `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points
- `x2` is the third element at index 2 in `data`
- `y2` is the fourth element at index 2 in `data`
- `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\)
- `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\)
- `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\)
- `cp1` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th + al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th + al)})\)
- `cp2` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th - al)})\)

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index 2 in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index 2 in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\), `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\), `cp1` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th + al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th + al)})\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{math.sin(th - al)})\)**
