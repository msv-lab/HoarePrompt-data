The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but rather controls the flow of the loop. Since no variables are being updated or assigned new values within this line of code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` equals `x2`, `y1` equals `y2`, `cp1` is either `x2, y2` or a point calculated using trigonometric functions depending on whether `distance <= RADIUS_2` or not, `cp2` is only defined if `distance > RADIUS_2`, and the `cross_points` list contains both `cp1` and `cp2` unless `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, in which case it only contains `cp1`.**
