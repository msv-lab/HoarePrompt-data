Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances. `cross_points` is a list that includes `cp2` appended to its previous contents if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` is true. If `cp2` does not meet the condition, `cross_points` remains unchanged.***
