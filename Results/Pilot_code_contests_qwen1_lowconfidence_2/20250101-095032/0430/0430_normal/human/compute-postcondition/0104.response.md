Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes the following:
   - `i` is `j + 1`
   - `x1` is `j + 1`
   - `y1` is `i`
   - `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - i)`
   - `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances.

2. The code snippet `cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`.

Since the code only appends `cp1` to the list `cross_points` and does not modify the existing variables, the values of `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, and `cp2` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `x1` is `j + 1`, `y1` is `i`, `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - i)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances as described, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1`.**
