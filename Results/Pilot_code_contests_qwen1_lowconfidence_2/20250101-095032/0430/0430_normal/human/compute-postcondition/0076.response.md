The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` using the `math.hypot` function. However, the value of `x1` is not provided in the initial state. Since `x2` is the first element of `data[j]` and `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, and `i` equals `j`, we can infer that `x1` should be the first element of `data[i]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `num_data` is greater than 0
- `i` equals `j`
- `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`

After executing the code, the value of `distance` is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, where `x1` is the first element of `data[i]` and `y1` is the second element of `data[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num_data` is greater than 0, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[i][0] - data[j][0], data[i][1] - data[j][1])`**
