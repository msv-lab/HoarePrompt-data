Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points with `cp2` appended if both coordinates of `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0]. `x2` is the third element at index `2` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `2` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\). If `cp2` is within the specified range, `cp2` remains as \((x1 + \mathbf{math.cos(th - al)}, y1 + \mathbf{sin(th - al)})\); otherwise, no change to `cp2`.***
