The code snippet appends `cp2` to the `cross_points` list. Based on the initial state, `cross_points` is initially a list that may or may not contain `cp1`, depending on whether the conditions `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0` are met. However, the code does not change the conditions for appending `cp1`, it only appends `cp2`. The values of the other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state of `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` appended to its previous contents (which could include `cp1` if the conditions were met).

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances, `cross_points` is a list that includes `cp2` appended to its previous contents which could be `[cp1]` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0` were true.**
