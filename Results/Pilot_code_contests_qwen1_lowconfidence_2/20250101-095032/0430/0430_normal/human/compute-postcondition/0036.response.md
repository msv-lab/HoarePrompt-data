According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `num_data` using the variable `j`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `i` is an integer
- `j` is an integer
- `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`
- `cp1` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`
- `cp2` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th - al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`
- `cross_points` contains the tuples `[cp2]` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the range of `num_data`.

Given that the loop just finished an iteration with the current value of `j`, the next iteration will use `j + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j + 1 < num_data`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `i` remains the same integer
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j + 1`
- `x2` becomes the first element of `data[j + 1]`
- `y2` becomes the second element of `data[j + 1]`
- `distance`, `th`, `al`, `cp1`, `cp2`, and `cross_points` will be recalculated based on the new values of `x2` and `y2`

The final state before the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j + 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j + 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th - al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`, and `cross_points` contains the tuples `[cp2]` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
