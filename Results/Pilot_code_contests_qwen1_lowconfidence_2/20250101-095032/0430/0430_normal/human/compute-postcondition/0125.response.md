Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is `num_data - num_data`, `x1` is the last element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the element at index `num_data + 1` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `num_data - 1`. After all iterations, `j` will be `num_data - 1`.
- The variable `i` is initialized to `num_data` and is not modified inside the loop unless it encounters a `continue` statement, but since no such statement exists, `i` remains `num_data`.
- `x1` and `y1` are the elements at index `num_data` and `num_data + 1` respectively in the `data` list, and they do not change throughout the loop.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2` and whether the calculated intersection points `cp1` and `cp2` fall within the bounds `[0.0, 10.0]`.
- All valid intersection points are appended to the `cross_points` list.

Since the loop processes all elements in `data` and updates the `cross_points` list based on the conditions, after the loop completes, `cross_points` will contain all valid intersection points generated during the loop execution.
