`cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp2` remains unchanged, but `cross_points` now includes `cp2`. The conditions for appending `cp1` to `cross_points` do not affect this operation because the code does not depend on the conditions involving `cp1`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `cross_points` contains the previous elements plus `cp2`.**
