Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is equal to `(x1, y1)` if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, otherwise `cp1` is equal to `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is equal to `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`, otherwise `cp2` is also equal to `(x1, y1)`, and `cross_points` is a list containing the tuples `(x1, y1)` and `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if `0.0 <= (x1 + math.cos(th - al)) <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= (y1 + math.sin(th - al)) <= 10.0`. `cross_points` may also contain the tuples `[cp2]` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables `i` and `j`:** The loop runs for each `j` from 0 to `num_data - 1`, excluding when `i == j`. Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be `num_data - 1` and `i` will still be an integer but will have been incremented for every valid `j`.
- **Variables `x2` and `y2`:** These are the coordinates of the `j`-th tuple in the `data` list. After the loop, `x2` and `y2` will be the coordinates of the last tuple in the list, since `j` will be `num_data - 1`.
- **Variable `distance`:** This is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. It is calculated for each pair `(i, j)` where `i != j`.
- **Variables `th` and `al`:** These are derived from the coordinates of `(x2, y2)` relative to `(x1, y1)`. They represent the angle and the half-angle of the chord between the points.
- **Variables `cp1` and `cp2`:** These are the intersection points of the circles centered at `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` with radii `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` respectively. They are only added to `cross_points` if they lie within the bounds `[0.0, 10.0]` for both coordinates.
- **Variable `cross_points`:** This list accumulates all valid intersection points found during the loop iterations. If no valid points are found for a particular pair `(i, j)`, `cross_points` remains unchanged.

Since the loop does not modify `x1` and `y1` directly, they retain their initial values, which are the coordinates of the first tuple in `data`.
