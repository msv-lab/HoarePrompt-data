Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have executed.

### Initial State
- \( i \) is \( \text{num\_data} \)
- \( j \) is 0
- \( x1 \) is the first element at index \( \text{num\_data} \) in \( \text{data} \)
- \( y1 \) is the second element at index \( \text{num\_data} \) in \( \text{data} \)
- \( \text{cross\_points} \) is a list of all valid intersection points \( (\text{cp1}, \text{cp2}) \)

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over \( j \) from 0 to \( \text{num\_data} - 1 \). For each iteration:
1. The loop checks if \( i == j \). If true, it continues to the next iteration.
2. It sets \( x2 \) and \( y2 \) to the elements at index \( j \) in the \( \text{data} \) list.
3. It calculates the Euclidean distance \( \text{distance} \) between \( (x1, y1) \) and \( (x2, y2) \).
4. If \( \text{distance} \leq \text{RADIUS\_2} \):
   - If \( x1 == x2 \) and \( y1 == y2 \), then \( \text{cp1} \) and \( \text{cp2} \) are both set to \( (x1, y1) \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates \( \text{th} \) (angle) and \( \text{al} \) (angle difference) and uses them to compute \( \text{cp1} \) and \( \text{cp2} \).
5. It checks if \( \text{cp1} \) and \( \text{cp2} \) are within the range [0.0, 10.0]. If so, they are appended to \( \text{cross\_points} \).

### Final Output State
After the loop has executed all iterations, the following conditions hold:
- \( i \) remains \( \text{num\_data} \) because the loop increments \( j \) but \( i \) is never changed inside the loop.
- \( j \) takes on all values from 0 to \( \text{num\_data} - 1 \).
- \( x1 \) and \( y1 \) will be the first element and its corresponding second element from the \( \text{data} \) list at the start of the loop, and these values do not change throughout the loop.
- \( \text{cross\_points} \) will contain all valid intersection points computed during the loop iterations, ensuring that both \( \text{cp1} \) and \( \text{cp2} \) are within the range [0.0, 10.0].

### Conclusion
Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is a value from 0 to `num_data-1`, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop, where `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0].**
