Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`, `cross_points` is a list with `cp1` appended, where `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
