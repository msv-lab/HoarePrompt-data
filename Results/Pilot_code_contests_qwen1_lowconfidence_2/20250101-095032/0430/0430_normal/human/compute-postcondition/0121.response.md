Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances. If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, `cross_points` is a list with `cp1` appended. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged, where `th` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`***
