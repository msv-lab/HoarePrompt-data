Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is assigned the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. The distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`***
