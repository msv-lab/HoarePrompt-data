`x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `data[j]`. The value of `j` is equal to `i`, but the specific values of `x2` and `y2` depend on the content of `data[j]`. The preconditions that `num_data` must be greater than 0 and `i` equals `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is greater than 0, `i` equals `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`**
