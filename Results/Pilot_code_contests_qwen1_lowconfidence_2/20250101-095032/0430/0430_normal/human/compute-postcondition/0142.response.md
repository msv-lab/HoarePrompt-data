Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to `(x1, y1)`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.pi / 3`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3), y1 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + math.pi / 3))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`***
