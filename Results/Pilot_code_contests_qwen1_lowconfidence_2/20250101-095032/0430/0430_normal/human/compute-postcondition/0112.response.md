The code snippet assigns new values to `x2` and `y2` from the list `data` at index `j`. This changes the values of `x2` and `y2`, but does not affect the values of the other variables. The initial values of `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `cp1`, `cp2`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` is `data[j][0]`, `y2` is `data[j][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - num_data, y2 - num_data)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
