To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues and how the variables change during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `j + 1`
   - `x1` is `j + 1`
   - `y1` is `i`
   - `x2` and `y2` are values at index `j` of `data`
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - (j + 1), y2 - i)`
   - `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances
   - `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in `range(num_data)`.

3. **Changes During Each Iteration:**
   - `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

4. **Next Iteration Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `num_data`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be `num_data - 1` at the end of the current iteration for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `num_data`.
   - Consequently, `i` will be `num_data`, `x1` will be `num_data`, and `y1` will be `num_data`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` and `y2` are values at index `num_data - 1` of `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - num_data, y2 - num_data)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.**

Note: The exact values of `x2` and `y2` depend on the specific values in `data` at index `num_data - 1`.
