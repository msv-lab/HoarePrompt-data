Output State: **`num_data` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `num_data` ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values**.

Explanation:
- The loop runs `num_data` times based on the input value of `num_data`.
- Each iteration appends a tuple of float values read from `stdin` to the `data` list.
- After all iterations, the `data` list will contain exactly `num_data` tuples.
- The variables `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` do not change during the loop and retain their initial values.
- The initial value of `num_data` is an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive, as specified in the initial state. After the loop completes, `num_data` remains the same unless new input changes its value outside the loop.
