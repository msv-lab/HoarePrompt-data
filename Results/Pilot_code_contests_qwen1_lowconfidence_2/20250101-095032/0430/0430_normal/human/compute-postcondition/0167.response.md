The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points.**
