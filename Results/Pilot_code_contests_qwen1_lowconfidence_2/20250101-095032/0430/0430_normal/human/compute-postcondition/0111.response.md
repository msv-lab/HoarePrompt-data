Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `x1` is `num_data`, `y1` is `num_data`, `x2` and `y2` are values at index `num_data - 1` of `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - num_data, y2 - num_data)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the relative positions and distances, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`; otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition is the same as the if part.***
