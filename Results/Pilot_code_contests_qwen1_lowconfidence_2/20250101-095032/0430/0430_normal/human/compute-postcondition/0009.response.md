The code `data.append(tuple(float(s) for s in stdin.readline().split(',')))` appends a new tuple to the list `data`. The tuple is created by converting each string from the input line into a float using a generator expression.

Given the initial state:
- `num_data` is at least 2 (specific value not known)
- `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12
- `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12
- `data` is a list containing two tuples

After executing the code, a new tuple will be appended to the list `data`. Since the exact input from `stdin.readline().split(',')` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of the new tuple. However, we know that the new tuple will contain floats.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `num_data` is at least 3 (since one more tuple was added to the list)
- `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12
- `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12
- `data` is now a list containing three tuples

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing three tuples**
