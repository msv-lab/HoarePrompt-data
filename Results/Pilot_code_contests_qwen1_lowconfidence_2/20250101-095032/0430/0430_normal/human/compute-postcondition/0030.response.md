The code `cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the tuple `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. This does not change the individual values of the variables `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, `cp1`, or `cp2`. It only adds `cp1` to the list `cross_points`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, and `cp2` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th - al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`. The current value of `cp1[0]` is within the range [0.0, 10.0] and the current value of `cp1[1]` is within the range [0.0, 10.0]; `cross_points` contains the appended `cp1` tuple.**
