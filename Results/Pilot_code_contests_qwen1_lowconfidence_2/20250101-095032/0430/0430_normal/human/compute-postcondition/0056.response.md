The code updates the `distance` variable to the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` using `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1`, `y1`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and the values of `i` and `data` remain unchanged.**
