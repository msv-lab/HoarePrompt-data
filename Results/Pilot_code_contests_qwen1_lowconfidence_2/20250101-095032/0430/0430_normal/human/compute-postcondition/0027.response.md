Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - `x2` is assigned the first element of `data[j]`.
   - `y2` is assigned the second element of `data[j]`.
   - `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`.
   - `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
   - `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.
   - `cp1[0] = x1 + math.cos(th + al)`.
   - `cp1[1] = y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `cp2 = x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

This line creates a new tuple `cp2` where:
- The first element of `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al)`.
- The second element of `cp2` is `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

Since `th` and `al` are defined as:
- `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al = math.acos(distance)`.

These values do not change during the execution of the code, so they remain as originally defined.

After executing the code, the values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, `cp1[0]`, and `cp1[1]` remain unchanged. Only `cp2` is added as a new variable with its computed values.

**Output State:**
- `i` is an integer.
- `j` is an integer.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`.
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.
- `cp1[0] = x1 + math.cos(th + al)`.
- `cp1[1] = y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.
- `cp2` is a tuple with elements `x1 + math.cos(th - al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.
