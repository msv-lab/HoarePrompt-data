The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` using the `math.hypot` function. However, the initial state does not include the value of `x1`. Therefore, `x1` remains unchanged from its initial value in the initial state.

The output state will include the updated value of `distance` which is the result of the `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` calculation, while keeping the other variables as they are in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `x2` is assigned the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`**
