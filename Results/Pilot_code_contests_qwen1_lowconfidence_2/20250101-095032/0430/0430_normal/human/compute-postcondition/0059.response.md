The code snippet calculates `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. This formula does not directly affect the values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, or `th`. The value of `al` is derived from `distance`.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `distance` is already defined as the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`.
2. The formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` is used to compute `al`.

The output state should include the updated value of `al` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))**
