The code initializes an empty list named `data`. This does not change the values of `n`, `num_data`, `RADIUS`, or `RADIUS_2`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `num_data` is an integer read from stdin, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is an empty list**
