Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points. If the Euclidean distance between \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, both coordinates of `cp2` are checked to ensure they are within the range [0.0, 10.0]. If so, `cp2` is added to `cross_points`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.***
