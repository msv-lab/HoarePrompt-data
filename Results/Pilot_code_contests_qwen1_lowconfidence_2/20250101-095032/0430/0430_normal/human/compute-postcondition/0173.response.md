The code calculates `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. To find the value of `al`, we need to know the value of `distance`.

From the initial state, `distance` is defined as:
\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \]

Let's denote \( x1 = d_{x1} \), \( y1 = d_{y1} \), \( x2 = d_{x2} \), and \( y2 = d_{y2} \). Then,
\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(d_{x2} - d_{x1})^2 + (d_{y2} - d_{y1})^2} \]

Therefore,
\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}((d_{x2} - d_{x1})^2 + (d_{y2} - d_{y1})^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(d_{x2} - d_{x1})^2 + (d_{y2} - d_{y1})^2}) \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `x2` is the third element at index 2 in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index 2 in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `th` is \(\mathbf{math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)}\), `al` is \(\mathbf{math.acos}((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / (2.0 \cdot \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})\)**
