Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 0 (remains unchanged as it starts the loop), `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data` (remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state), `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data` (remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state), `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` (remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state), and the current value of `i` is equal to `j`***
