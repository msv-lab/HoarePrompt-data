Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, and `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points. Since the if condition `i == j` is checked and neither the if nor the else part updates these variables, their states remain unchanged.***
