The code `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp2` is defined as `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`. If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both equal to `(x1, y1)`, and `cross_points` remains unchanged. 

Since the initial conditions do not specify the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `th`, `al`, and the conditions `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2` are not explicitly given, we assume the general case where `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`. In this case, `cp2` is updated to `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

Therefore, the `cross_points` list will now contain the new point `cp2` added to it.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is the angle in radians calculated by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is equal to `(x1, y1)`, `cp2` is equal to `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `cross_points` is a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1)` and the new tuple `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if `0.0 <= (x1 + math.cos(th - al)) <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= (y1 + math.sin(th - al)) <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
