`count` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num_data` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num_data` ≤ 100, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is a list containing exactly `num_data` tuples of float values, `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `max_overlap` is 0, `count` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1), and the condition `(math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS)` is true**.
