The code changes the value of `cp2`. Initially, `cp2` was defined as `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`. After executing the code snippet, `cp2` is updated to `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged: `i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `al` is `math.acos((\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`, and `cp2` is now `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `x2` is the third element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y2` is the fourth element at index `num_data` in `data`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\), `al` is `math.acos((\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2})`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`**
