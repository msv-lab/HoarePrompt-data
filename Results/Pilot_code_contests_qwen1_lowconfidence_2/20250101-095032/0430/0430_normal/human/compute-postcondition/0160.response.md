Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data`, `j` is 1, `x1` is the first element at index `num_data` in `data`, `y1` is the second element at index `num_data` in `data`, `cross_points` is a list of all valid intersection points. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, then both `cp1` and `cp2` are set to `(x1, y1)`. Otherwise, `th` is set to `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is set to `math.acos(distance / distance)`, and `cp1` and `cp2` are set to `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` respectively.***
