`count` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`num_data`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `data`, `cross_points`, and `max_overlap`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num_data` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_data} \leq 100\); `RADIUS` is \(1 + 1e-12\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2 + 1e-12\); `data` is a list containing at least two tuples of float values; `cross_points` is a list containing at least one tuple of valid intersection points `(cp1, cp2)` where both `cp1` and `cp2` are within the range \([0.0, 10.0]\); `max_overlap` is the value of `count` from the last loop iteration; `count` is `max_overlap + 1`.
