`cp1` and `cp2` are assigned the values of `x1, y1`. The values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `x1`, `y1`, `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and `cp1` and `cp2` are equal to `(x1, y1)`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is the original value of `j + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `cp1` is equal to `(x1, y1)`, `cp2` is equal to `(x1, y1)`**
