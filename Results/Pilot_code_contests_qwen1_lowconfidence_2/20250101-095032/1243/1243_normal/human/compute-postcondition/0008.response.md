`str` is updated by concatenating the current value of `str` with `'/'` and the stripped version of `word`. The `word` variable remains as the next element in the `array`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`word` is the next element in `array`, `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of `word`**
