Let's break down the given information and determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `line` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/'. It starts with at least one '/'.
   - `array` is a list of substrings from `line`, split at each '/'.
   - `str` is an empty string.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for word in array:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `array`.
   - For the loop to execute, `array` must contain at least one element (i.e., the list must not be empty).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `line` starts with at least one '/', splitting `line` at '/' will always result in a list with at least one element.
   - Therefore, we don't need to adjust the state of `line` or `str`.
   - We need to ensure that `array` is not empty. Given that `line` starts with at least one '/', the list `array` will definitely contain at least one element.

5. **Final State**:
   - The initial conditions already ensure that the loop will execute because `array` will always contain at least one element after splitting `line`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed in the given states for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`line` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/', `array` is a list of substrings from `line`, split at each '/', `str` is an empty string.**
