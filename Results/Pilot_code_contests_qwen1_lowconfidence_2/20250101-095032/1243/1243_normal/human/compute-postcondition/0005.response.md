The code `str = str + '/' + word.strip()` concatenates the existing value of `str` with the string `'/'` followed by the stripped version of `word`. Since `word` is a non-empty string, `word.strip()` will remove any leading and trailing whitespace from `word`.

The initial state is `word` is a non-empty string.

After executing the code:
- `str` will be updated to its current value concatenated with `'/'` and then with the stripped version of `word`.
- The value of `word` remains unchanged as the code does not affect `word`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`word` is a non-empty string; `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of `word`**.
