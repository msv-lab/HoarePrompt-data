The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function might be expected to work with an input string that meets specific criteria (a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/'). Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely processes this input string and returns a result based on its content.

Since the function signature does not include any parameters and the question only provides the output cases without specifying the exact return values, we can infer that the function processes the input string but the return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a non-empty input string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/', and returns a result based on the content of the string.**
