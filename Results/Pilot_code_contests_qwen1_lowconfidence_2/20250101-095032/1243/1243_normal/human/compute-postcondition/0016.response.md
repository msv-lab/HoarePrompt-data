Functionality: **The function processes a non-empty input string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', ensuring the string starts with at least one '/'. It then splits the string by '/', strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each resulting substring, and concatenates them back together with '/' in between. The final result, which is the processed string, is written to standard output. Potential edge cases include strings with no non-empty substrings after splitting, where the output remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but modifies and outputs the string directly.**
