`str` is updated by appending `'/ '` followed by the stripped version of `word` to its current value. If `word` is not an empty string, the operation is performed. The `word` remains the next element in the `array`, and the `str` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`word` is the next element in `array`; `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of `word`**
