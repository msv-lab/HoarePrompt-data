The code `array = line.split('/')` splits the string `line` by the '/' character and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `array`. The initial state of `line` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/'. After executing the code, the value of `line` remains unchanged, but `array` now contains the substrings from `line`, split at each '/'.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/'; `array` is a list of substrings from `line`, split at each '/'**
