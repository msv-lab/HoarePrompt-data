The code assigns an empty string to the variable `str`. The variable `line` and the list `array` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `line` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/'; `array` is a list of substrings from `line`, split at each '/'; `str` is an empty string.

Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/'; `array` is a list of substrings from `line`, split at each '/'; `str` is an empty string.**
