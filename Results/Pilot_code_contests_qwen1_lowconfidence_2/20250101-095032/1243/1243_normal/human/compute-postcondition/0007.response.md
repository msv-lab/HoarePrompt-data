According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `array`, and for each iteration, `word` is updated to the current element of `array`. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is a non-empty string, and `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of `word`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following steps need to be considered:

1. The variable `word` needs to be set to the next element in `array`.
2. The variable `str` needs to be updated to include the next element of `array` in its construction.

Given that `word` is a non-empty string at the end of the last iteration, the next `word` will be the next element in `array`, which is not empty (since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `array`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `word` is the next element in `array` and `str` is updated to include this new `word`.

State: **`word` is the next element in `array`, `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of `word`**
