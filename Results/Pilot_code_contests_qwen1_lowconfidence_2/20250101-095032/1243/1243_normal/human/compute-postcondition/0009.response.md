Postcondition: ***`word` is the next element in `array`, `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of `word`. If `word` is not an empty string, the condition holds as is. If `word` is an empty string, `str` remains unchanged from its original value plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of `word`.***
