The code `stdout.write(str)` writes the value of `str` to the standard output but does not change the value of `str` itself. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`word` is the last element in `array`, `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of each non-empty word in `array`. If there are no non-empty words in `array`, `str` remains the original value of `str`.**
