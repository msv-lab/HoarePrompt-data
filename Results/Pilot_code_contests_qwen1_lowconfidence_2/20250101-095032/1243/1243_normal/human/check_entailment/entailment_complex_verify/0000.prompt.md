You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The new operating system BerOS has a nice feature. It is possible to use any number of characters '/' as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional '/'. For example, strings //usr///local//nginx/sbin// and /usr/local/nginx///sbin are equivalent. The character '/' (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character '/'.

A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters '/'.

Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.

Input

The first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character '/' â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character '/'. The length of the given line is no more than 100 characters, it is not empty.

Output

The path in normalized form.

Examples

Input

//usr///local//nginx/sbin


Output

/usr/local/nginx/sbin
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = ''
    for word in array:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
    stdout.write(str)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where multiple consecutive '/' characters are at the beginning of the path correctly. According to the problem description, only one '/' is needed at the start of the path, and any additional '/' characters should be removed. However, the program does not remove these leading '/' characters properly. 

For example, consider the input `///usr///local//nginx///sbin`:

- The program would split the string and append each non-empty word after stripping whitespace, resulting in the output `////usr/local/nginx///sbin`.
- This output is not in the normalized form because there are still multiple '/' characters in the beginning.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that only a single '/' is kept at the start of the path. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    line = input().strip('/')
    parts = line.split('/')
    normalized_path = '/' + '/'.join(filter(None, parts))
    print(normalized_path)
```

This corrected version first strips any trailing '/' characters and then ensures that only a single '/' is present at the start of the path.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin, stdout

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/'. The length of the string does not exceed 100 characters.
def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = ''
    for word in array:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `word` is the last element in `array`, `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of each non-empty word in `array`. If there are no non-empty words in `array`, `str` remains the original value of `str`.
    stdout.write(str)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a non-empty input string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', ensuring the string starts with at least one '/'. It then splits the string by '/', strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each resulting substring, and concatenates them back together with '/' in between. The final result, which is the processed string, is written to standard output. Potential edge cases include strings with no non-empty substrings after splitting, where the output remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but modifies and outputs the string directly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
