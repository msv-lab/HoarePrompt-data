You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The new operating system BerOS has a nice feature. It is possible to use any number of characters '/' as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional '/'. For example, strings //usr///local//nginx/sbin// and /usr/local/nginx///sbin are equivalent. The character '/' (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character '/'.

A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters '/'.

Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.

Input

The first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character '/' â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character '/'. The length of the given line is no more than 100 characters, it is not empty.

Output

The path in normalized form.

Examples

Input

//usr///local//nginx/sbin


Output

/usr/local/nginx/sbin
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = ''
    for word in array:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
    stdout.write(str)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly transforms the given path into its normalized form. It splits the input string by the '/' character, filters out any empty strings resulting from multiple '/' characters, and then reconstructs the path with a single '/' at the beginning followed by each non-empty segment. This approach ensures that the path contains the smallest possible number of '/' characters, meeting the requirement of the problem description. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly as far as the examples and reasoning indicate, the output is always in the normalized form as specified.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin, stdout

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', starting with at least one '/'. The length of the string does not exceed 100 characters.
def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = ''
    for word in array:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `word` is the last element in `array`, `str` is the original value of `str` plus `'/'` plus the stripped version of each non-empty word in `array`. If there are no non-empty words in `array`, `str` remains the original value of `str`.
    stdout.write(str)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
