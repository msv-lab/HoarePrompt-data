You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The new operating system BerOS has a nice feature. It is possible to use any number of characters '/' as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional '/'. For example, strings //usr///local//nginx/sbin// and /usr/local/nginx///sbin are equivalent. The character '/' (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character '/'.

A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters '/'.

Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.

Input

The first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character '/' â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character '/'. The length of the given line is no more than 100 characters, it is not empty.

Output

The path in normalized form.

Examples

Input

//usr///local//nginx/sbin


Output

/usr/local/nginx/sbin
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    line = stdin.readline()
    array = line.split('/')
    str = ''
    for word in array:
        if word != '':
            str = str + '/' + word.strip()
    stdout.write(str)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where multiple consecutive '/' characters are at the beginning of the path correctly. According to the problem description, only one '/' is needed at the start of the path, and any additional '/' characters should be removed. However, the program does not remove these leading '/' characters properly. 

For example, consider the input `///usr///local//nginx///sbin`:

- The program would split the string and append each non-empty word after stripping whitespace, resulting in the output `////usr/local/nginx///sbin`.
- This output is not in the normalized form because there are still multiple '/' characters in the beginning.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that only a single '/' is kept at the start of the path. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    line = input().strip('/')
    parts = line.split('/')
    normalized_path = '/' + '/'.join(filter(None, parts))
    print(normalized_path)
```

This corrected version first strips any trailing '/' characters and then ensures that only a single '/' is present at the start of the path.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a non-empty input string containing only lowercase Latin letters and the character '/', ensuring the string starts with at least one '/'. It then splits the string by '/', strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each resulting substring, and concatenates them back together with '/' in between. The final result, which is the processed string, is written to standard output. Potential edge cases include strings with no non-empty substrings after splitting, where the output remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but modifies and outputs the string directly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
