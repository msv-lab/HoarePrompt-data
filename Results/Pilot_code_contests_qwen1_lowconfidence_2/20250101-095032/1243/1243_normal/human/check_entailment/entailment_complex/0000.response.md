Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly transforms a given path into its normalized form according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string using `stdin.readline()`, which is consistent with the problem description where the input is a non-empty string containing lowercase Latin letters and the character '/'. The string starts with at least one '/' and has a maximum length of 100 characters.

2. **Path Normalization**: 
   - The string is split by '/' using `line.split('/')`. This splits the string into an array of substrings, including empty strings if there are consecutive '/' characters.
   - A loop iterates over each word in the array. If the word is not empty (i.e., it's a non-empty directory name or file name), it appends a '/' followed by the stripped version of the word (`word.strip()`). This ensures that any leading or trailing spaces within the directory or file names are removed, and unnecessary slashes are handled appropriately.

3. **Output**: The constructed string is written to `stdout` using `stdout.write(str)`. This ensures that the output is the normalized path as required.

The program correctly handles all cases mentioned in the problem description:
- Paths with multiple consecutive '/' characters are reduced to a single '/' where necessary.
- Paths ending with '/' are handled appropriately, as they are converted to the root directory representation.
- Paths without any non-empty elements remain unchanged (e.g., '//').
- Paths with only one element (e.g., '/') are also handled correctly.

Thus, the program always meets the requirements of the problem description.
