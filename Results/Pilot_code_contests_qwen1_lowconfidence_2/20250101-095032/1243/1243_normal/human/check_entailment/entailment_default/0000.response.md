Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where multiple consecutive '/' characters are at the end of the path, except for the root directory. According to the problem description, the path should contain the smallest possible number of characters '/'. However, the current implementation does not remove these trailing '/' characters properly. For example, the input `/usr///local//nginx/sbin//` should result in `/usr/local/nginx/sbin`, but the code will produce `/usr/local/nginx/sbin//`. This is because the loop concatenates each non-empty substring with a leading '/'. To fix this, the code should ensure that the final result does not end with an extra '/'. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    line = stdin.readline().strip('/')  # Remove trailing '/'
    array = line.split('/')
    str = '/'.join(word for word in array if word)
    stdout.write(str)
```

This corrected version ensures that the final result does not end with an extra '/'.
