Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where multiple consecutive '/' characters are at the beginning of the path correctly. According to the problem description, only one '/' is needed at the start of the path, and any additional '/' characters should be removed. However, the program does not remove these leading '/' characters properly. 

For example, consider the input `///usr///local//nginx///sbin`:

- The program would split the string and append each non-empty word after stripping whitespace, resulting in the output `////usr/local/nginx///sbin`.
- This output is not in the normalized form because there are still multiple '/' characters in the beginning.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that only a single '/' is kept at the start of the path. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    line = input().strip('/')
    parts = line.split('/')
    normalized_path = '/' + '/'.join(filter(None, parts))
    print(normalized_path)
```

This corrected version first strips any trailing '/' characters and then ensures that only a single '/' is present at the start of the path.
