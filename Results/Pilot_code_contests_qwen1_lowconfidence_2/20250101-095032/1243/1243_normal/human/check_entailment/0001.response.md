Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly transforms the given path into its normalized form. It splits the input string by the '/' character, filters out any empty strings resulting from multiple '/' characters, and then reconstructs the path with a single '/' at the beginning followed by each non-empty segment. This approach ensures that the path contains the smallest possible number of '/' characters, meeting the requirement of the problem description. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly as far as the examples and reasoning indicate, the output is always in the normalized form as specified.
