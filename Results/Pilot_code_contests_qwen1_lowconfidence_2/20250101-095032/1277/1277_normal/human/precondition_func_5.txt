n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i either equals -1 or is a valid index (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n) such that the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … does not cycle and ends with -1.
