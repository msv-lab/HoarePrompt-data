Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly evaluates the program based on the given problem description. The program indeed implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of `ans` by processing the elements in the most optimal order. The provided output hints for `func_13` confirm that the function prints the results as expected, without any issues handling different types of inputs. Since the problem description and the program logic align, and the output hints do not indicate any issues, the original assessment remains accurate.
