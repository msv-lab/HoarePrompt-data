Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum `ans` value and does not output the correct order of operations. Specifically, the program fails to account for the order in which operations are performed, which significantly affects the outcome. The output hints do not address the core issue with the order of operations and contributions to `ans`. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
