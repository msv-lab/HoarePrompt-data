Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum possible value of `ans` by choosing the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them. The program handles the constraints and ensures that each position is visited exactly once. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the necessary variables and reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Processing**: It processes each position `i` to update the array `l` such that `l[j]` stores the sum of values added to `a_j` due to the operation performed on its predecessor.
3. **Sorting and Construction**: It sorts the indices based on the values in `l` to ensure that positions contributing more to `ans` are processed first. It constructs the order of operations and calculates the maximum `ans`.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail based on the provided logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
