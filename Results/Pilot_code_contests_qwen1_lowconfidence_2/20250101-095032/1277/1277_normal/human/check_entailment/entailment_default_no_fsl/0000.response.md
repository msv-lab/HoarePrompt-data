Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code does not account for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The code correctly initializes the variables and reads the input arrays `a` and `b` using `func_6()`. However, the logic for calculating the maximum `ans` is flawed.

2. **Updating `l` and Sorting**: The code updates the `l` list based on the values in `b` but does not ensure that all indices are processed correctly. The sorting step is necessary, but the way `l` is updated and the sorting logic need to be more robust.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Updating `a`**: The code attempts to update `a` based on the sorted order of `l1`, but it does not handle the case where `b[i]` might refer to an invalid index or where `b` contains `-1`.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

- **Issue 1**: The code does not properly handle the case where `b[i]` is `-1` or refers to an invalid index. In such cases, `l[b[i] - 1]` should not be incremented.
  
- **Issue 2**: The sorting logic and the way `l1` is constructed might miss some critical indices. The code needs to ensure that all valid indices are processed correctly.

To fix these issues, the code should:
1. Ensure that `l[b[i] - 1]` is only incremented when `b[i]` is a valid index (i.e., `b[i] > 0`).
2. Properly handle the sorting and updating of `a` based on the sorted indices.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus the correctness is **False**.
