Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b` according to the problem constraints.
   - It uses `func_1()` to read the integer `n`.
   - It uses `func_6()` to read the lists `a` and `b` as lists of integers.

2. **Initialization and Data Structure**:
   - The program initializes a list `l` of size `n` with zeros. This list will be used to store the contributions from elements pointed to by `b`.

3. **Processing Elements**:
   - The program iterates over the list `b` and updates the list `l` to accumulate the values pointed to by `b`. Specifically, for each `i` where `b[i] > 0`, it adds `a[i]` to `l[b[i] - 1]`.

4. **Sorting and Accumulating Values**:
   - It then sorts the list `l1`, which contains pairs `[l[i], i]` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The program calculates the maximum possible `ans` by adding the corresponding `a[i]` values where `b[i] > 0`, updating `a[i]` accordingly.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - Finally, the program generates the order of operations by creating a list `l2` from the sorted indices.
   - It prints the maximum `ans` and the order of operations.

### Key Points:

- **Guaranteed Non-Cyclic Sequences**: The problem statement guarantees that the sequence `b_i, b_{b_i}, ...` will eventually end with `-1`. Therefore, the program correctly handles these sequences without encountering infinite loops.
- **Correct Order of Operations**: The program generates the correct order of operations by sorting the list `l1` and constructing `l2` from the sorted indices. This ensures that the operation is performed in the optimal order to maximize `ans`.
- **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies valid inputs, the program correctly handles the expected cases without requiring additional error handling for invalid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it correctly follows the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
