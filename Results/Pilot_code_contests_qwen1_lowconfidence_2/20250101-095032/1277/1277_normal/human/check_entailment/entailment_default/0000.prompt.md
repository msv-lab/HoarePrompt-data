You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and simply prompts the user to provide an integer input. It then returns this integer input. There are no parameters `n`, `a`, or `b` involved in the function, as indicated by the code and annotations. The function does not manipulate any lists or perform any operations on the input integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the integer input provided by the user is returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return float(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a float value input by the user. However, the provided code snippet contains a logical error as it uses `input()` which is meant to read a string input from the user, but it is immediately converted to a float using `float()`. This can lead to a `ValueError` if the user inputs a non-numeric value. Additionally, the function does not perform any operations on the previously defined lists `a` and `b`, as these variables are not used within the function. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has consumed a user input and returned it as a float, assuming the input is valid. If the input is not numeric, a `ValueError` will be raised.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns the result of `input()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has taken an input from the user via the standard input method, and this input is returned. There are no preconditions specified for the input other than it being of any type that can be accepted by the `input()` function, which includes strings and numbers. The function does not modify any variables or perform any operations on the input list `a` or the boolean list `b`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` reads three lines of input from standard input. The first line contains an integer `n`, the second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing array `a`, and the third line contains `n` space-separated integers representing array `b`. The function then returns a map object containing strings of the input integers from arrays `a` and `b`. However, the function does not process these arrays further, nor does it calculate any values based on the input. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input data.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and reads a line of space-separated input from the user, converting each element into an integer. It then returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include the user entering no input, entering non-integer values, or entering a single value. If the user enters non-integer values, those elements will not be converted and will remain as strings in the map object.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return list(func_5())
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6()` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies \(-10^6 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\)), and `b` (a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` either equals -1 or is a valid index such that the sequence `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots` does not cycle and ends with -1). The function returns a list generated by calling `func_5()`, which operates on the lists `a` and `b` under the specified conditions. The returned list is determined by `func_5()` and is the final state of the program after execution.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7()` does not perform any operations on its input parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. Instead, it simply reassigns the standard input and output streams to files named `input.txt` and `output.txt`, respectively. After executing these assignments, the function concludes without affecting the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`. The postconditions of the function are that the standard input is redirected to `input.txt` and the standard output is redirected to `output.txt`. There are no operations performed on the input lists `a` and `b`, and no further processing is done on the integer `n`.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero), and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to achieve this by repeatedly replacing `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x` as the GCD and `y` as 0. This process handles all valid inputs where `y` is non-zero. However, it does not handle the case where `x` or `y` is zero; in such cases, the function will still proceed as intended, assuming `y` is not zero as per the precondition.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    return x * y // func_8(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first multiplies `x` by `y`, then performs integer division of the result. The function returns the integer division of `x` multiplied by `y`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code or annotations, but it's important to note that if either `x` or `y` is zero, the result will be zero since integer division of zero by any number (except zero) is zero. Additionally, if `y` is one, the result will be `x` itself, as `x * 1` divided by `1` is `x`. No other specific edge cases are highlighted in the provided information.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(b, m):
    g = func_8(b, m)
    if g != 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return pow(b, m - 2, m)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts two parameters: `b` and `m`, where `b` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, and `m` is a positive integer. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `b` and `m` is 1. The function first calls another function `func_8(b, m)` to compute the value of `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the result of `pow(b, m - 2, m)`. The function handles the case where the gcd condition might not hold by ensuring that it only proceeds with the computation if `g` equals 1.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(a, b, m):
    a = a % m
    inv = func_10(b, m)
    if inv == -1:
        return -999999999
    else:
        return inv * a % m
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11(a, b, m)` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. It first reduces `a` modulo `m` and then checks if `b` has a modular inverse modulo `m` by calling `func_10(b, m)`. If `func_10(b, m)` returns `-1`, indicating that no modular inverse exists, the function returns `-999999999`. Otherwise, it computes and returns the product of the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m` and the reduced value of `a` modulo `m`, also taken modulo `m`. This function handles the case where `m` is positive, as implied by the initial annotation.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_6()
    b = func_6()
    l = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if b[i] > 0:
            l[b[i] - 1] += a[i]
    l1 = []
    for i in range(n):
        l1.append([l[i], i])
    l1.sort()
    ans = 0
    l2 = []
    for i in range(n):
        l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)
        if b[l1[i][1]] > 0:
            ans += a[l1[i][1]]
        a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]
    func_13(ans)
    func_13(*l2)
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the values returned by `func_1()`, `func_6()`, and `func_13()`. It processes these values to create a new list `l` which is updated based on the indices specified in `b`. After processing, it sorts the indices and updates the values in `a` based on the sorted order. Finally, it calls `func_13()` twice, first with the accumulated sum `ans` and then with a transformed version of the sorted indices. The function ensures that `l` is updated at least once, `n` is a positive integer, and at least one element in `b` is between 1 and `n`. The final state includes `ans` being the sum of certain elements from `a`, `l2` containing adjusted indices, and `a` updated according to the sorted order. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no elements in `b` are between 1 and `n`, or when `b` contains `-1` values, which would leave `l` unchanged and `a` unaffected in those positions.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts variable-length arguments `args`, a separator `sep` (default ' '), a file-like object `file` (default `sys.stdout`), an end string `end` (default '\n'), and a boolean `flush` (default `False`). It prints the values in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, it flushes the output. After execution, the `file` writes the values in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, it also flushes the output. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty or `sep` is an empty string. The function does not modify `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush` outside the context of the print operation.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
