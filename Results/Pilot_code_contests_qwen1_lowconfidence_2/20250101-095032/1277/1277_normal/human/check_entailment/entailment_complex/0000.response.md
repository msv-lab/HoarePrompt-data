Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_12` does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of `ans` and does not generate the correct order of operations to achieve this maximum value.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Initialization and Update Logic**:
   - The code initializes `l` as a list of zeros and updates it based on the indices specified in `b`. However, the logic for updating `l` is incorrect. The update should reflect the contributions from both the current element `a[i]` and the recursive addition through `b[i]`.

2. **Order of Operations**:
   - The code sorts the indices based on the updated values in `l` and generates the order of operations. However, the logic for generating the order of operations is flawed. The order should ensure that each element is processed in a way that maximizes the sum `ans`.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where `b` contains `-1` values, which should leave `l` unchanged and `a` unaffected in those positions.
   - The code does not ensure that the order of operations is optimal for maximizing `ans`.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 2 3
2 3 -1
```

Expected Output:
```
10
1 2 3
```

Actual Output:
The code might produce a different order or incorrect value due to the flawed logic in updating `l` and generating the order of operations.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize `ans` and generate the correct order of operations. Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem description.
