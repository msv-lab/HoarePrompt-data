You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and simply prompts the user to provide an integer input. It then returns this integer input. There are no parameters `n`, `a`, or `b` involved in the function, as indicated by the code and annotations. The function does not manipulate any lists or perform any operations on the input integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the integer input provided by the user is returned.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1.
def func_2():
    return float(input())
    #The program returns a float input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a float value input by the user. However, the provided code snippet contains a logical error as it uses `input()` which is meant to read a string input from the user, but it is immediately converted to a float using `float()`. This can lead to a `ValueError` if the user inputs a non-numeric value. Additionally, the function does not perform any operations on the previously defined lists `a` and `b`, as these variables are not used within the function. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has consumed a user input and returned it as a float, assuming the input is valid. If the input is not numeric, a `ValueError` will be raised.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i either equals -1 or is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n, and for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … will eventually end with -1.
def func_3():
    return input()
    #The program returns input() which is not specified in the initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns the result of `input()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has taken an input from the user via the standard input method, and this input is returned. There are no preconditions specified for the input other than it being of any type that can be accepted by the `input()` function, which includes strings and numbers. The function does not modify any variables or perform any operations on the input list `a` or the boolean list `b`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided through standard input in the following format: the first line contains an integer n, the second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a, and the third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array b. The output consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer representing the maximum ans, and the second line contains n space-separated integers representing the order of operations.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing strings of the input integers from arrays a and b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads three lines of input from standard input. The first line contains an integer `n`, the second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing array `a`, and the third line contains `n` space-separated integers representing array `b`. The function then returns a map object containing strings of the input integers from arrays `a` and `b`. However, the function does not process these arrays further, nor does it calculate any values based on the input. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input data.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are present in the provided code snippet. The function `func_5` does not take any arguments.
def func_5():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each input element split from user input into an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and reads a line of space-separated input from the user, converting each element into an integer. It then returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include the user entering no input, entering non-integer values, or entering a single value. If the user enters non-integer values, those elements will not be converted and will remain as strings in the map object.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i either equals -1 or is a valid index (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n) such that the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … does not cycle and ends with -1.
def func_6():
    return list(func_5())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_5() which operates on the given lists a and b with the conditions specified
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6()` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies \(-10^6 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\)), and `b` (a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` either equals -1 or is a valid index such that the sequence `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots` does not cycle and ends with -1). The function returns a list generated by calling `func_5()`, which operates on the lists `a` and `b` under the specified conditions. The returned list is determined by `func_5()` and is the final state of the program after execution.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of n integers where each integer is either a positive integer between 1 and n or -1. Additionally, it's guaranteed that for any index i, the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … will eventually reach -1.
def func_7():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7()` does not perform any operations on its input parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. Instead, it simply reassigns the standard input and output streams to files named `input.txt` and `output.txt`, respectively. After executing these assignments, the function concludes without affecting the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`. The postconditions of the function are that the standard input is redirected to `input.txt` and the standard output is redirected to `output.txt`. There are no operations performed on the input lists `a` and `b`, and no further processing is done on the integer `n`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and y is not zero (y != 0).
def func_8(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`; `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero), and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to achieve this by repeatedly replacing `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x` as the GCD and `y` as 0. This process handles all valid inputs where `y` is non-zero. However, it does not handle the case where `x` or `y` is zero; in such cases, the function will still proceed as intended, assuming `y` is not zero as per the precondition.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers.
def func_9(x, y):
    return x * y // func_8(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division of x multiplied by y
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first multiplies `x` by `y`, then performs integer division of the result. The function returns the integer division of `x` multiplied by `y`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code or annotations, but it's important to note that if either `x` or `y` is zero, the result will be zero since integer division of zero by any number (except zero) is zero. Additionally, if `y` is one, the result will be `x` itself, as `x * 1` divided by `1` is `x`. No other specific edge cases are highlighted in the provided information.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to m, where m is a positive integer, and gcd(b, m) = 1.
def func_10(b, m):
    g = func_8(b, m)
    if (g != 1) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    else :
        return pow(b, m - 2, m)
        #The program returns the result of pow(b, m - 2, m), where `b` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, and gcd(`b`, `m`) = 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two parameters: `b` and `m`, where `b` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, and `m` is a positive integer. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `b` and `m` is 1. The function first calls another function `func_8(b, m)` to compute the value of `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the result of `pow(b, m - 2, m)`. The function handles the case where the gcd condition might not hold by ensuring that it only proceeds with the computation if `g` equals 1.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is an integer, and m is a positive integer (m > 0). The function func_10(b, m) is assumed to return the modular inverse of b modulo m if it exists, otherwise -1.
def func_11(a, b, m):
    a = a % m
    inv = func_10(b, m)
    if (inv == -1) :
        return -999999999
        #The program returns -999999999
    else :
        return inv * a % m
        #`inv * a % m`, where `inv` is the result of `func_10(b, m)` and `a` is the remainder when the original `a` is divided by `m`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11(a, b, m)` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. It first reduces `a` modulo `m` and then checks if `b` has a modular inverse modulo `m` by calling `func_10(b, m)`. If `func_10(b, m)` returns `-1`, indicating that no modular inverse exists, the function returns `-999999999`. Otherwise, it computes and returns the product of the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m` and the reduced value of `a` modulo `m`, also taken modulo `m`. This function handles the case where `m` is positive, as implied by the initial annotation.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of integers where -10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1.
def func_12():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_6()
    b = func_6()
    l = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if b[i] > 0:
            l[b[i] - 1] += a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be a positive integer, `a` is the return value of `func_6()`, `b` is a list of integers where at least one element is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` zeros that has been updated at least once based on the positions specified by `b`. If the loop does not execute, then `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values, and `l` remains a list of `n` zeros.
    l1 = []
    for i in range(n):
        l1.append([l[i], i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is the return value of `func_6()`, `b` is a list of integers where at least one element is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` zeros that has been updated at least once based on the positions specified by `b`, `l1` is a list of sublists `[l[i], i]` for each `i` in `b`, and `n` must be at least 1.
    l1.sort()
    ans = 0
    l2 = []
    for i in range(n):
        l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)
        
        if b[l1[i][1]] > 0:
            ans += a[l1[i][1]]
        
        a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `ans` is the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all `i` where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, `n` must be at least 1, `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1 for i in range(n)]`, `a` is updated such that `a[l1[i][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[i][1]]` plus `l1[i][0]` for each `i`.
    func_13(ans)
    func_13(*l2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the values returned by `func_1()`, `func_6()`, and `func_13()`. It processes these values to create a new list `l` which is updated based on the indices specified in `b`. After processing, it sorts the indices and updates the values in `a` based on the sorted order. Finally, it calls `func_13()` twice, first with the accumulated sum `ans` and then with a transformed version of the sorted indices. The function ensures that `l` is updated at least once, `n` is a positive integer, and at least one element in `b` is between 1 and `n`. The final state includes `ans` being the sum of certain elements from `a`, `l2` containing adjusted indices, and `a` updated according to the sorted order. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no elements in `b` are between 1 and `n`, or when `b` contains `-1` values, which would leave `l` unchanged and `a` unaffected in those positions.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed, sep is a string (default ' '), file is a file-like object (default sys.stdout), end is a string (default '\n'), and flush is a boolean (default False).
def func_13():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`).
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is the current value of `end` which was originally '\n', the file has written `\n`, and if the `flush` parameter was `True` in `kwargs`, `file.flush()` has been called. Otherwise, no additional operations were performed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts variable-length arguments `args`, a separator `sep` (default ' '), a file-like object `file` (default `sys.stdout`), an end string `end` (default '\n'), and a boolean `flush` (default `False`). It prints the values in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, it flushes the output. After execution, the `file` writes the values in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, it also flushes the output. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty or `sep` is an empty string. The function does not modify `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush` outside the context of the print operation.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
