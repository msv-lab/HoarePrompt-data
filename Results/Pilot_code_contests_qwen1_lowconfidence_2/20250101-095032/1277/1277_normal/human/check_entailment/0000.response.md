Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum `ans` value and does not output the correct order of operations. Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum `ans`**:
   - The program attempts to sort the contributions based on the `b` array and adds the elements accordingly. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the order of operations matters. The value of `a_{b_i}` is updated after adding `a_i` to it, which means the order in which the operations are performed affects the final `ans`.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The program sorts the elements based on their contribution to `l`, which might not necessarily give the correct order of operations to maximize `ans`. For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     3
     1 2 3
     2 3 -1
     ```
     The program outputs `10` and `[1, 2, 3]`, but the correct maximum `ans` should be `9` with the order `[1, 3, 2]`.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider the above example:
- Initial `a`: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Initial `b`: `[2, 3, -1]`

If we follow the order `[1, 3, 2]`:
1. Operation on `1`: `a[0]` is added to `ans` and `a[1]`.
   - `ans = 1`
   - `a = [1+1, 2+1, 3] = [2, 3, 3]`
2. Operation on `3`: `a[2]` is added to `ans`.
   - `ans = 1 + 3 = 4`
   - `a = [2, 3, 3+3] = [2, 3, 6]`
3. Operation on `2`: `a[1]` is added to `ans` and `a[2]`.
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7`
   - `a = [2, 3+3, 6+3] = [2, 6, 9]`

The maximum `ans` is `10` with the order `[1, 2, 3]`, but this order does not account for the correct update of `a_{b_i}`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the order of operations correctly, leading to a potentially suboptimal solution.
