The function `func_10` accepts two parameters: `b` and `m`, where `b` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m`, and `m` is a positive integer. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `b` and `m` is 1. The function first calls another function `func_8(b, m)` to compute the value of `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the result of `pow(b, m - 2, m)`. The function handles the case where the gcd condition might not hold by ensuring that it only proceeds with the computation if `g` equals 1.
