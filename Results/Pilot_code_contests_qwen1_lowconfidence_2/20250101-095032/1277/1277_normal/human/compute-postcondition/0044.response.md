The function `func_13(*l2)` is called with `l2` as an argument. However, the function definition or body is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact impact of this function call. Given the initial state and the provided information, we can only update the variables that are explicitly affected before the function call.

Let's summarize the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `ans` is the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all `i` where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1 for i in range(n)]`
- `a` is updated such that `a[l1[i][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[i][1]]` plus `l1[i][0]` for each `i`

The function call `func_13(*l2)` does not directly modify `i`, `ans`, `n`, `l2`, or `a`. It might modify some internal state within the function, but without the function definition, we cannot determine those changes.

Therefore, the only explicit changes are the updates to `a` as described. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all `i` where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, `n` must be at least 1, `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1 for i in range(n)]`, `a` is updated such that `a[l1[i][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[i][1]]` plus `l1[i][0]` for each `i`.**
