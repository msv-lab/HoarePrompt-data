The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Since no specific value was given for `sep` in the initial state, `sep` remains as `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which means if `sep` was provided in the `kwargs`, it uses that value, otherwise, it defaults to a space character `' '`.

The states of the other variables (`at_start`, `args`, `file`, `end`, `flush`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`), `file.write(sep)` has been executed**
