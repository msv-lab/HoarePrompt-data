Postcondition: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least two elements left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`), and `sep` has been written to `file` if `not at_start` is true. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
