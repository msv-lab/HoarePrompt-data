`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. However, the value of `sep` does not change within this operation. The other variables (`at_start`, `args`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`)**
