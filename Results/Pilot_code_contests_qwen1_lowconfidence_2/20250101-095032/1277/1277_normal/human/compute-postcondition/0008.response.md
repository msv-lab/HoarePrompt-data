The code `at_start = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. This does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element, `sep` is the value written to `file` followed by the string representation of `x`, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`)**
