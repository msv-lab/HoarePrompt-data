The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `end` variable by removing its value from `kwargs` using `pop` with a default value of `\n`. The `file` object is used to write this value to the file. The other variables are not affected.

Since `end` is originally set to a string (default '\n'), after executing `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, the value of `end` will be removed from `kwargs` and the `file.write` method will write this value (which is `\n`) to the file. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is no longer defined in `kwargs` and was '\n', the file has written '\n'.**
