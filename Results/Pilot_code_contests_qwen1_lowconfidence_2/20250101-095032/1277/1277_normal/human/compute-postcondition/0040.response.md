Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `l2` now includes `l1[2][1] + 1` as its last element, `a[l1[1][1]]` is `val + l1[1][0]`, `a[l1[2][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[2][1]]` plus `l1[2][0]`. If `b[l1[3][1]] > 0` is true, an `IndexError` is raised due to the out-of-bounds access `a[l1[3][1]]`.**
