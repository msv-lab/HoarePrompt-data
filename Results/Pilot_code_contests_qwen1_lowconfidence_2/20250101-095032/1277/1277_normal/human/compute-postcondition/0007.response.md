`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `at_start` is `False`, `file.write(sep)` has already been executed before this line. This means that `sep` has been written to `file`. Now, `str(x)` will be written to `file` followed by `sep`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element, `sep` is the value written to `file` followed by the string representation of `x`, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`)**
