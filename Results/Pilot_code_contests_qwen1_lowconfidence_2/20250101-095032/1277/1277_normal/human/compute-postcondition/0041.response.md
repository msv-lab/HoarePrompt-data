Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

- Initial State: 
  - `i` is 3
  - `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`
  - `n` must be greater than 2
  - `l2` now includes `l1[2][1] + 1` as its last element
  - `a[l1[1][1]]` is `val + l1[1][0]`
  - `a[l1[2][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[2][1]]` plus `l1[2][0]`
  - If `b[l1[3][1]] > 0` is true, an `IndexError` is raised due to the out-of-bounds access `a[l1[3][1]]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]
```

Given that `i` is 3, this means the code will execute as:
```python
a[l1[3][1]] += l1[3][0]
```

Since `b[l1[3][1]] > 0` would raise an `IndexError`, we know that `b[l1[3][1]]` is not greater than 0. Therefore, the code does not raise an `IndexError` and the operation `a[l1[3][1]] += l1[3][0]` is performed.

Now, let's update the variables based on the operation:
- `a[l1[3][1]]` is updated by adding `l1[3][0]` to its current value.

The updated state is:
- `i` remains 3
- `ans` is unchanged
- `n` remains greater than 2
- `l2` remains unchanged
- `a[l1[1][1]]` remains `val + l1[1][0]`
- `a[l1[2][1]]` remains the original value of `a[l1[2][1]]` plus `l1[2][0]`
- `a[l1[3][1]]` is updated by adding `l1[3][0]` to its original value

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `l2` now includes `l1[2][1] + 1` as its last element, `a[l1[1][1]]` is `val + l1[1][0]`, `a[l1[2][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[2][1]]` plus `l1[2][0]`, `a[l1[3][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[3][1]]` plus `l1[3][0]`**
