`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was already its value in the initial state. Therefore, there is no change to any of the variables.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least two elements left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`)**
