The function `func_13(ans)` is called with `ans` as an argument. The value of `ans` is the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all `i` where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`. The function call itself does not provide any direct output or modify any variables outside of its scope, so the only change is that `ans` is passed to `func_13()`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `l2`, `a`, and `l1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all `i` where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, `n` must be at least 1, `l2` contains `[l1[i][1] + 1 for i in range(n)]`, `a` is updated such that `a[l1[i][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[i][1]]` plus `l1[i][0]` for each `i`, and `ans` is the sum of `a[l1[i][1]]` for all `i` where `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`.**
