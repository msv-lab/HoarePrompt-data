Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`, `n` is at least 1, `l2` contains a new element equal to `l1[0][1] + 1`, the current value of `b[l1[i][1]]` is greater than 0.***

Since there is no else part in the code, the overall postcondition is simply the postcondition of the if part. The if condition checks if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, and if true, it increments `i` by 1, updates `ans` by adding `a[l1[i][1]]` to its original value, and ensures that all other specified variables remain unchanged.
