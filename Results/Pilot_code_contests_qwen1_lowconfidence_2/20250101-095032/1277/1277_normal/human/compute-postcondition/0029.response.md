The code `ans += a[l1[i][1]]` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `a[l1[i][1]]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `l2` contains a new element equal to `l1[0][1] + 1`, and the current value of `b[l1[i][1]]` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0, the index used in `a[l1[i][1]]` is `a[l1[0][1]]`.

The output state after executing the code will be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now 1).
- `ans` is updated to be its original value plus `a[l1[0][1]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`, `n` is at least 1, `l2` contains a new element equal to `l1[0][1] + 1`, the current value of `b[l1[i][1]]` is greater than 0.**
