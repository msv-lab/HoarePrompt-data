The code snippet `l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)` assumes that `l1` and `l2` are lists, and `i` is an index within the bounds of `l1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, let's analyze the impact:

- `l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)` appends to `l2` the value obtained by taking the second element (`[1]`) from the list `l1` at the index `i` (which is 0), and adding 1 to it.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `l1`. Since `i` is 0, the code attempts to access `l1[0][1]`. Without knowing the actual value of `l1[0][1]`, we cannot determine the exact value appended to `l2`. But we know that `l2` gets a new element which is `l1[0][1] + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`i` and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `l2` contains a new element equal to `l1[0][1] + 1`**
