Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - `args` must have at least one element.
   - `sep` is the value written to `file` followed by the string representation of `x`.
   - `file` is the same file object.
   - `end` is a string (default '\n').
   - `flush` is a boolean (default `False`).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each element in `args`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `at_start` is `False` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has already executed at least once.
   - `args` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `sep` is updated to include the value of `x` from the current iteration.
   - `file` remains the same.
   - `end` and `flush` remain as they were at the start of the loop.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least one element left to process.
   - `at_start` will be `False` because the loop has already executed at least once.
   - `sep` will be updated to include the value of the next `x` in `args`.
   - `file`, `end`, and `flush` remain unchanged.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `at_start` remains `False`.
   - `args` must have at least one element left.
   - `sep` will be updated to include the next `x` in `args`.
   - `file` remains the same.
   - `end` and `flush` remain as they were at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element left, `sep` will be updated to include the next `x` in `args`, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`)**
