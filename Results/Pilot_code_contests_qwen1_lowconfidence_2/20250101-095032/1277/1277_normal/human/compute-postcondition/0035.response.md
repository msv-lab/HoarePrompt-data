Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`, `n` is at least 1, `l2` now includes `l1[2][1] + 1` as its last element, and `a[l1[1][1]]` is `val + l1[1][0]`. If `b[l1[2][1]] > 0`, then the function continues with the updated values as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function does not change any additional variables beyond those already mentioned in the precondition.***
