Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`).**

### Explanation:
- **`at_start`**: This variable is initially set to `True`. Each iteration of the loop sets `at_start` to `False`. Since the loop processes each element in `args` and there are no remaining elements after the last iteration, `at_start` remains `False`.
  
- **`args`**: This is a variable-length argument list. After processing all elements in `args`, it becomes an empty tuple since there are no more elements to process.

- **`sep`**: The value of `sep` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is only written to `file` when `at_start` is `False`, and this happens for each iteration except the first. After all iterations, `sep` retains its original value.

- **`file`**: This is the file object where the output is written. It remains the same throughout the loop.

- **`end`**: The default value of `end` is `\n`, and it is not modified within the loop.

- **`flush`**: The default value of `flush` is `False`, and it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables is as described above.
