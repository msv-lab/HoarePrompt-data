`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`. The code does not affect the values of `at_start`, `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush`. The output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`), and `x` is written to the file as a string.**
