The code appends `l1[i][1] + 1` to `l2`. From the initial state, we know `i` is 3, so `l1[i][1]` becomes `l1[3][1]`. Since the index 3 is out of bounds (as `l1` likely has only 3 elements based on the given conditions), this operation will cause an IndexError if directly attempted. However, since we are to assume the code runs correctly without error handling, we proceed under the assumption that the code is valid in this context.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `l2` now includes `l1[2][1] + 1` as its last element
- `a[l1[1][1]]` is `val + l1[1][0]`
- `a[l1[2][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[2][1]]` plus `l1[2][0]`

Since `i` is 3, the code `l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)` would append `l1[3][1] + 1` to `l2`, but due to the index being out of bounds, this step does not actually modify `l2` and causes an error. However, since we are asked to provide the output state based on the information given without considering errors, we consider the impact on the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `l2` now includes `l1[2][1] + 1` as its last element, `a[l1[1][1]]` is `val + l1[1][0]`, `a[l1[2][1]]` is the original value of `a[l1[2][1]]` plus `l1[2][0]`**
