According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), and `flush` is a boolean (default `False`). Since `x` is written to the file as a string during each iteration, `args` should now have one less element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least two elements left.

State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least two elements left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`)**
