`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the write buffers of the file object `file`. This does not change the values of `at_start`, `args`, `sep`, `end`, or `kwargs.pop('flush', False)`. The file object `file` is still the same, and it has written `\n`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is the current value of `end` which was originally '\n', the file has written `\n`, and `file.flush()` has been called.**
