Postcondition: `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is the current value of `end` which was originally '\n', the file has written `\n`, and the if condition is met with `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` being `False`.
