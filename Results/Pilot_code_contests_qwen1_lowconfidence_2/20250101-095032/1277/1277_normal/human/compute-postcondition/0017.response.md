The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. However, the initial state does not specify a specific value for `x`. Therefore, we only know that `x` is converted to a string before being written to the file.

Other variables are not affected by this code. Specifically:
- `at_start` remains `False`.
- `args` must still have at least two elements left.
- `sep` remains the original value written to the file.
- `file` remains the same file object.
- `end` remains a string (default `\n`).
- `flush` remains a boolean (default `False`).
- `sep` is written to `file` if `not at_start` is true, which it is not in this case (`at_start` is `False`).

Therefore, the only change is that the string representation of `x` is written to the file.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least two elements left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`), and the string representation of `x` is written to `file`.**
