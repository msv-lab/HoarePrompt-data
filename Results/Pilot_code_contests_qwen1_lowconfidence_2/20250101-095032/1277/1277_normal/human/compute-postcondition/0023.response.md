Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty tuple, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is the current value of `end` which was originally '\n', the file has written `\n`, and if the `flush` parameter was `True` in `kwargs`, `file.flush()` has been called. Otherwise, no additional operations were performed.***
