The code `a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]` increments the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` by `l1[i][0]`. From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`
- `n` is at least 1
- `l2` contains a new element equal to `l1[0][1] + 1`
- The current value of `b[l1[i][1]]` is greater than 0

Since `i` is 1, we are updating `a[l1[1][1]]` by `l1[1][0]`.

Let's denote the initial value of `a[l1[1][1]]` as `val`. After the code runs, `a[l1[1][1]]` becomes `val + l1[1][0]`.

The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `a[l1[0][1]]`, `n` is at least 1, `l2` contains a new element equal to `l1[0][1] + 1`, the current value of `b[l1[1][1]]` is greater than 0, `a[l1[1][1]]` is `val + l1[1][0]`**
