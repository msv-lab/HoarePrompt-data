The variable `at_start` is set to `False`, which was already its initial value. The other variables (`args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, and `x`) remain unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `at_start`. 

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`), and `x` is written to the file as a string.**
