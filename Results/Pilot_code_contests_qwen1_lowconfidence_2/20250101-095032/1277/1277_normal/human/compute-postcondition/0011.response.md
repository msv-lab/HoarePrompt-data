Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element left, `sep` is the original value written to the file, `file` is the same file object, `end` is a string (default '\n'), `flush` is a boolean (default `False`). Since the if condition `not at_start` is true, the program does not enter the if block and thus the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.***
