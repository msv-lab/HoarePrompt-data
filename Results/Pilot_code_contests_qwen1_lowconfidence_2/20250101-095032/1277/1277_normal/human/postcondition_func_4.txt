The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and reads a line of space-separated input from the user, converting each element into an integer. It then returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include the user entering no input, entering non-integer values, or entering a single value. If the user enters non-integer values, those elements will not be converted and will remain as strings in the map object.
