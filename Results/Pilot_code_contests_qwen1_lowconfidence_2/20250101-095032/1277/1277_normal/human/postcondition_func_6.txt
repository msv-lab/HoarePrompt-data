The function `func_7()` does not perform any operations on its input parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. Instead, it simply reassigns the standard input and output streams to files named `input.txt` and `output.txt`, respectively. After executing these assignments, the function concludes without affecting the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`. The postconditions of the function are that the standard input is redirected to `input.txt` and the standard output is redirected to `output.txt`. There are no operations performed on the input lists `a` and `b`, and no further processing is done on the integer `n`.
