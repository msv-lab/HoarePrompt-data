The function `func_8` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (with `y` not being zero), and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to achieve this by repeatedly replacing `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x` as the GCD and `y` as 0. This process handles all valid inputs where `y` is non-zero. However, it does not handle the case where `x` or `y` is zero; in such cases, the function will still proceed as intended, assuming `y` is not zero as per the precondition.
