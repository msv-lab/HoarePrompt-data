The function `func_6()` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies \(-10^6 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\)), and `b` (a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` either equals -1 or is a valid index such that the sequence `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots` does not cycle and ends with -1). The function returns a list generated by calling `func_5()`, which operates on the lists `a` and `b` under the specified conditions. The returned list is determined by `func_5()` and is the final state of the program after execution.
