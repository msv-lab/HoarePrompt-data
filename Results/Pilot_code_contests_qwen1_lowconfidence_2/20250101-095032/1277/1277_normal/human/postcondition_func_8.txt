The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first multiplies `x` by `y`, then performs integer division of the result. The function returns the integer division of `x` multiplied by `y`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code or annotations, but it's important to note that if either `x` or `y` is zero, the result will be zero since integer division of zero by any number (except zero) is zero. Additionally, if `y` is one, the result will be `x` itself, as `x * 1` divided by `1` is `x`. No other specific edge cases are highlighted in the provided information.
