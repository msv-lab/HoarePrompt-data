The function `func_4()` reads three lines of input from standard input. The first line contains an integer `n`, the second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing array `a`, and the third line contains `n` space-separated integers representing array `b`. The function then returns a map object containing strings of the input integers from arrays `a` and `b`. However, the function does not process these arrays further, nor does it calculate any values based on the input. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input data.
