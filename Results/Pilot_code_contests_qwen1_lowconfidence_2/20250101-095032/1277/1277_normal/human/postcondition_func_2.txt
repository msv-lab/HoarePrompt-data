The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns the result of `input()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has taken an input from the user via the standard input method, and this input is returned. There are no preconditions specified for the input other than it being of any type that can be accepted by the `input()` function, which includes strings and numbers. The function does not modify any variables or perform any operations on the input list `a` or the boolean list `b`.
