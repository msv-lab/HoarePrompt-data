The function accepts no parameters and simply prompts the user to provide an integer input. It then returns this integer input. There are no parameters `n`, `a`, or `b` involved in the function, as indicated by the code and annotations. The function does not manipulate any lists or perform any operations on the input integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the integer input provided by the user is returned.
