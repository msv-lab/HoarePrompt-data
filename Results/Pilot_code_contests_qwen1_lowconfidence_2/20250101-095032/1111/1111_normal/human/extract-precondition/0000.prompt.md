You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Suppose there is a h × w grid consisting of empty or full cells. Let's make some definitions:

  * r_{i} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the left side in the i-th row (1 ≤ i ≤ h). In particular, r_i=0 if the leftmost cell of the i-th row is empty. 
  * c_{j} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in the j-th column (1 ≤ j ≤ w). In particular, c_j=0 if the topmost cell of the j-th column is empty. 



In other words, the i-th row starts exactly with r_i full cells. Similarly, the j-th column starts exactly with c_j full cells.

<image> These are the r and c values of some 3 × 4 grid. Black cells are full and white cells are empty.

You have values of r and c. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of r and c. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7). In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7).

Input

The first line contains two integers h and w (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 10^{3}) — the height and width of the grid.

The second line contains h integers r_{1}, r_{2}, …, r_{h} (0 ≤ r_{i} ≤ w) — the values of r.

The third line contains w integers c_{1}, c_{2}, …, c_{w} (0 ≤ c_{j} ≤ h) — the values of c.

Output

Print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7).

Note

In the first example, this is the other possible case.

In the second example, it's impossible to make a grid to satisfy such r, c values.

In the third example, make sure to print answer modulo (10^9 + 7).
Program:
```
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
