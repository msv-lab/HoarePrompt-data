The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file`'s content is now appended with `str(x)`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must have at least two elements remaining.
