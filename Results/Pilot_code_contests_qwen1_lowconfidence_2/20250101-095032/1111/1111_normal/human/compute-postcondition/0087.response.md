The code updates `n` by adding 1 if `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` are both true. However, the values of `i`, `j`, `r`, and `c` are not specified in the initial state. Since these values are not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. But we know that `n` was initially 1 and it could potentially be increased by 1 if the conditions are met.

Given the initial state where `w` is at least 2, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is 1, `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed, the only change is to `n`.

Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is 1 plus a boolean condition result (either 1 or 2), `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
