Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `w` must be greater than 0.
   - `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h`.
   - `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1.
   - If `c[i] < h` and `base[c[i]][i] == 1`, no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made.

2. **Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `w-1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine what changes occur in the loop body, but since the body is omitted, we need to focus on how the loop control variables (`i`) and any relevant conditions change.

4. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` from `0` to `w-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been the last value it took before the loop ended.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Given that `w` must be greater than 0, if `i` was the last value, then `i+1` should be within the range `[0, w-1]`.

5. **Conditions After the Loop Body**:
   - The conditions provided do not change based on the loop execution itself (since the body is omitted), so these conditions remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `w` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
- `c[i + 1]` must still not be less than `h`.
- `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` must still not be equal to 1.
- The condition `c[i] < h` and `base[c[i]][i] == 1` does not affect the state directly since the body is omitted.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`w` must be greater than 0, `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1.** 

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Final State: **`w` must be greater than 0, `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1, and `i` is increased by 1.**
