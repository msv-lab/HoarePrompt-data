Postcondition: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for all 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, and `args` has at least one element. Given that (not at_start), `at_start` is now `False` and the loop continues with the next element in `args`.**
