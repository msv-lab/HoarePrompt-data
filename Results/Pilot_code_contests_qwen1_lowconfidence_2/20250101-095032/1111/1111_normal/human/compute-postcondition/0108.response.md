The code `func_2(pow(2, n, 1000000007))` involves calculating \(2^n \mod 1000000007\) and passing the result to the function `func_2`. However, the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided in the initial state or within the snippet, so we only know that this specific calculation is performed.

Let's break it down:

1. `pow(2, n, 1000000007)` calculates \(2^n \mod 1000000007\).
2. This value is passed to `func_2`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we represent it symbolically.

Therefore, the value passed to `func_2` is \(2^n \mod 1000000007\).

Output State: **`func_2(2^n % 1000000007)`**
