The function `func_2(0)` is called, which means the index passed to the function is 0. According to the precondition, `base[j][i + 1]` is 1 for all valid \(j\) such that \(0 \leq j < c_i\), and \(i\) is \(i + 1\). For \(i = 0\), this means `base[j][1]` is 1 for all valid \(j\) such that \(0 \leq j < c_0\).

The condition for the function to return `None` is if \(\text{r}[i + 1]\) is less than \(w\) and \(\text{base}[i + 1][\text{r}[i + 1]]\) is 1. Since no specific values for `r[1]` and `w` are given, we cannot determine if this condition holds. However, since no specific values are provided and the precondition states that either \(\text{r}[i + 1]\) is not less than \(w\) or \(\text{base}[i + 1][\text{r}[i + 1]]\) is not equal to 1, we assume this condition does not hold, and thus the function does not return `None`.

Therefore, the function call `func_2(0)` does not change any variables or add any specific conditions, and the output state remains as per the initial state.

Output State: **`base[j][1]` is 1 for all valid \(j\) such that \(0 \leq j < c_0\), \(i\) is \(i + 1\), \(h\) must be greater than \(i + 1\), \(c_0\) is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop has executed, and either \(\text{r}[1]\) is not less than \(w\) or \(\text{base}[1][\text{r}[1]]\) is not equal to 1.**
