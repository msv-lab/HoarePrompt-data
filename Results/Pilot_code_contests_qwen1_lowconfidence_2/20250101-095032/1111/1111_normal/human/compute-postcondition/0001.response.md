The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` does the following:

1. It pops the value associated with the key `'sep'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns it to the variable `sep`. If `'sep'` is not in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space `' '`.
2. It pops the value associated with the key `'file'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns it to the variable `file`. If `'file'` is not in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

The initial values of `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for all 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.**
