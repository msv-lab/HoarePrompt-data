The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact content written to the file. We only know that `x` is an integer because `h` and `w` are both integers and `r` and `c` lists contain integers within specified ranges.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\)
- `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\)
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\)
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\)
- `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`
- `file` is modified by appending `str(x)` to its current content
- `at_start` is `False`
- `args` must have at least one element remaining

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is modified by appending `str(x)` to its current content, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element remaining, `x` is an integer**
