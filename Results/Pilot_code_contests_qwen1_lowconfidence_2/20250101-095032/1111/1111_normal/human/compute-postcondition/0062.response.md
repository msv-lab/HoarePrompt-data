Postcondition: ***`base[j][i]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci` and `i` is equal to the maximum value of `ci` plus 1, `h` must be greater than the maximum value of `ci` plus 1, `ci` is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop executed, and either `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1. If `r[i]` is less than `w` and `base[i][r[i]]` is 1, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function returns None.***
