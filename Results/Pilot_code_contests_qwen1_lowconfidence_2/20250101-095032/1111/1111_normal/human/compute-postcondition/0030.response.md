State: **`c` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `ci` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for j in range(ci):` will execute as long as `ci` is greater than 0.
2. We are given that `i` is 0, which is irrelevant to the condition for the loop to execute.
3. It is also given that `c` must have at least one element, but this alone does not ensure that the loop will execute because the loop condition involves `ci`.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `ci` must be greater than 0.

Hence, the state must include that `ci` must be greater than 0.
