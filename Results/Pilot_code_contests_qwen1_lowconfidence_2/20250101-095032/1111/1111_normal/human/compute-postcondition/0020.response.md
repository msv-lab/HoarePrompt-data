The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. Here, `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` removes the key 'end' from `kwargs` (if it exists) and returns its value, which defaults to `\n` if 'end' is not in `kwargs`.

Since `kwargs` is not specified and no specific 'end' value is provided, the default value of `\n` is used. This value is written to `file`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file`'s content is the concatenation of `str(x)` for all `x` in `args` followed by `\n`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list.**
