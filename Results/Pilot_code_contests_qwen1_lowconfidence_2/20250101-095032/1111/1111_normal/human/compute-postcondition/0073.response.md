According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `w-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` must be greater than 0, and `c[i]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i]][i]` is not equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we only need to ensure that the condition `w > 0` still holds true for the loop to continue. The condition `c[i]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i]][i]` is not equal to 1 will be checked again in the next iteration.

State: **`w` must be greater than 0, `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1**
