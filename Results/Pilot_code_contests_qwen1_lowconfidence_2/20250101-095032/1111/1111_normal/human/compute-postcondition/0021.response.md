Postcondition: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file`'s content is the concatenation of `str(x)` for all `x` in `args` followed by `\n`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'flush'` with the value `False`**
