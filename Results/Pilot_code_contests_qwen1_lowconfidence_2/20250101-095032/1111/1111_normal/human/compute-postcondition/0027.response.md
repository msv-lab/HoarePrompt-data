Output State: **`ri` is at least `i + 3`, `base[i+1][j]` where `0 ≤ j < ri` is 1, `base[i+1][j]` where `ri ≤ j < w` is 0, `base[i][j]` where `0 ≤ j < ri` is 1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ri` is at least `i + 3`.
   - `base[i+1][j]` where `0 ≤ j < ri` is 1.
   - `base[i+1][j]` where `ri ≤ j < w` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `ri` iterations, setting `base[i][j]` to 1 for each `j` in the range `0 ≤ j < ri`.

3. **After Loop Execution**:
   - After the loop completes, `base[i][j]` will be set to 1 for every `j` in the range `0 ≤ j < ri`.
   - Since `base[i+1][j]` was already 1 for `0 ≤ j < ri` in the initial state and the loop does not change these values, `base[i+1][j]` remains 1 for `0 ≤ j < ri` and 0 for `ri ≤ j < w`.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `ri` is less than `i + 3`, the loop will not execute, and the values will remain as specified in the initial state.
   - Specifically, `base[i][j]` will be 0 for all `j` since the loop does not run to set them to 1.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that `ri` is at least `i + 3`, `base[i+1][j]` where `0 ≤ j < ri` is 1, `base[i+1][j]` where `ri ≤ j < w` is 0, and `base[i][j]` where `0 ≤ j < ri` is 1.
