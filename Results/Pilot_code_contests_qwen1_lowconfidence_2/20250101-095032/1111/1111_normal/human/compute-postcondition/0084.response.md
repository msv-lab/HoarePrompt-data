Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `w` is greater than 0
   - `h` must be at least 1
   - `n` is 0
   - The function `func_2(0)` is not called
   - The return statement is not executed

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, w):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The `range(1, w)` function generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `w`.
   - For the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 2 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `w-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `w` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - Since `w` is initially greater than 0, we only need to ensure that `w` is at least 2.
   - The values of `h`, `n`, `func_2(0)`, and the return statement do not directly affect the loop execution based on the provided information.

### Final Adjusted State:

State: **`w` is at least 2, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is 0, `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
