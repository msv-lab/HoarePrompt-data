The function `func_2(0)` is called with an argument of `0`. However, the function definition or the exact operations within `func_2` are not provided in the initial state description. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we can only assume that it might affect the variables `base`, `h`, `i`, `ci`, `r`, and `w`. Since no changes to these variables are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, we can infer that the function might internally modify some of them.

Given the initial state:
- `base[j][i]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci` and `i` is equal to the maximum value of `ci`.
- `h` must be greater than `i`.
- `ci` is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop executed.
- `r[i]` is an integer less than `w` and the value of `base[i][r[i]]` is 1.

Since `func_2(0)` is called, the output state will depend on what `func_2` does. If `func_2` does not modify the given variables directly or their values are not explicitly shown, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the added information that the function `func_2` was called with an argument of `0`.

Output State: **`base[j][i]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci` and `i` is equal to the maximum value of `ci`; `h` must be greater than `i`; `ci` is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop executed; `r[i]` is an integer less than `w` and the value of `base[i][r[i]]` is 1; function `func_2` was called with an argument of `0`.**
