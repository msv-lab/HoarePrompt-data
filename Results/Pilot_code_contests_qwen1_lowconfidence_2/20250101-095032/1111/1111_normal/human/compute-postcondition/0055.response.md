Postcondition: **`base[j][i]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci` and `i` is equal to the maximum value of `ci`. `h` must be greater than `i`. `ci` is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop executed. `r[i]` is an integer less than `w` and the value of `base[i][r[i]]` is 1.**
