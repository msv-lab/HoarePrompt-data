According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop runs from `1` to `h-1` (inclusive), so for the loop to execute again, `h` must be at least 2.

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `w` is greater than 0.
- `h` must be at least 1.
- `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive.
- `func_2(0)` is not called.
- The return statement is not executed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be at least 2. Since `h` was at least 1 before the loop started, it can now be either 1 or 2 or any higher value to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state adjustments are as follows:
- `w` remains greater than 0.
- `h` must be at least 2.
- `n` remains an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive.
- `func_2(0)` remains not called.
- The return statement remains not executed.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
