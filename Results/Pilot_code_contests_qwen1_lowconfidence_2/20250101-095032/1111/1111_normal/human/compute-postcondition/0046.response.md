Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
   - `base[j][i]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
   - `i` is equal to `ci + 1`.
   - `ci` must be at least 1.
   - `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci` for all iterations.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(ci):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Analysis:

- The loop iterates over the range `range(ci)`. This means the loop will execute `ci` times.
- The variable `j` will take values from `0` to `ci-1`.

### Steps to Determine Adjusted States:

1. **Check the Range of `j`:**
   - Since `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci` for all iterations, this condition is already satisfied initially.

2. **Check the Value of `i`:**
   - The problem statement mentions that `i` is equal to `ci + 1`. This value of `i` should remain constant throughout the loop execution.

3. **Check the Initial Value of `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 0`. Therefore, `j` must be set to `0` at the beginning of the loop.

4. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < ci`. Given that `ci` is at least 1, the loop will always execute at least once if `j` starts from `0`.

### Conclusion:

- The initial state already satisfies the condition `0 <= j < ci` for all iterations.
- The value of `i` (which is `ci + 1`) does not change during the loop execution and is correctly set initially.
- The loop will start with `j = 0`.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed based on the provided conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is equal to `ci + 1`, `ci` must be at least 1, `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci` for all iterations, and the loop starts with `j` set to `0`.**

Since the loop starts with `j = 0`, we can explicitly include this in the state.

State: **`i` is equal to `ci + 1`, `ci` must be at least 1, `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci` for all iterations, and `j` is set to `0`.**
