Postcondition: **`base[j][i]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci` and `i` is equal to the maximum value of `ci`, `h` must be greater than `i`, `ci` is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop executed, and either `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1**
