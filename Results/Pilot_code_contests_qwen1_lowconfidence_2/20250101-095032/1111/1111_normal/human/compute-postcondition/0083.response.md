Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `w` is greater than 0.
   - For all `i` in the range of `w`, `c[i]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i]][i]` is not equal to 1.
   - `n` is 0.
   - The function `func_2(0)` is not called.
   - The return statement is not executed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The for loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `h`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the range of `i` (from 1 to `h`) must be valid.
   - This means `h` must be at least 1 because the loop starts from 1.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 1` and goes up to `h-1`, we need `h` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `w` and the conditions involving `c[i]` and `base[c[i]][i]` do not directly affect whether the loop starts executing.
   - `n` being 0, and the fact that `func_2(0)` is not called and the return statement is not executed, are not directly related to the loop starting to execute but they maintain the context of the program state.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `h` is at least 1.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 1, and `n` is 0, and the function `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
