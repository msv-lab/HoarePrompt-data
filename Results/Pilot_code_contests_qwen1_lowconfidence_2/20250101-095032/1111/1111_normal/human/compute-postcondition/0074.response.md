The function `func_2(0)` is called with an argument of `0`. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine what changes, if any, it might make to the variables. Since no changes to the variables `w` or `c[i + 1]` are explicitly shown in the provided code, and no assignment statements are present that would modify `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]`, the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`w` must be greater than 0, `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1**
