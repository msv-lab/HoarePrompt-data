According to the code, the loop condition for the `for` loop is `j` in the range from 1 to `w`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `w` is at least 2
- `h` must be at least 1
- `n` is 0
- `func_2(0)` is not called
- The return statement is not executed

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented and checked against `w`. Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `j` would be 2.

Given that `w` is at least 2, the loop will continue to execute if `j` (which will be 2) is still less than `w`. 

So, we need to update the state as follows:
- `w` remains at least 2
- `h` must still be at least 1
- `n` will be incremented by 1, so `n` will be 1
- `func_2(0)` remains not called
- The return statement remains not executed

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`w` is at least 2, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is 1, `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed**
