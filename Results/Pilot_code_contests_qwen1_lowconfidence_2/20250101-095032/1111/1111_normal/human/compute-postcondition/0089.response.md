Let's analyze the given code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `w` is at least 3
  - `h` must be at least 1
  - `n` is 1 plus a boolean condition result (either 1 or 2)
  - `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` are conditions involving some indices and values in lists `r` and `c`
  - `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed

- Code to execute:
  ```python
  n += r[i] < j and c[j] < i
  ```

- Impact of the code:
  - The code updates the value of `n` by adding 1 if both `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` are `True`.
  - If either `r[i] < j` or `c[j] < i` is `False`, then `n` remains unchanged.

Given that `n` is initially either 1 or 2 (since it is 1 plus a boolean condition result), the possible scenarios are:
- If both `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` are `True`, `n` becomes 2 or 3.
- If either condition is `False`, `n` remains 1 or 2.

Since the exact values of `r[i]`, `j`, and `c[j]` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `n`. However, we know that `n` will be either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the truth values of the conditions.

Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
