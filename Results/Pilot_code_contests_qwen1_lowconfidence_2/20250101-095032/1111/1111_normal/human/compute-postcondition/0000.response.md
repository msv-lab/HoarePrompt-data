The given code snippet is a docstring comment and does not actually perform any operation that would change the values of the variables. It simply provides documentation for what a function might do. Therefore, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **h and w are integers such that 1 ≤ h, w ≤ 10^3, r is a list of h integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ w for all 1 ≤ i ≤ h, and c is a list of w integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ h for all 1 ≤ j ≤ w.**
