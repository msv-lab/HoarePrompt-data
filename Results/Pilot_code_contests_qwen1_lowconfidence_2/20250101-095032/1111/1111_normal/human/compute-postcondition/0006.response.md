Postcondition: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for all 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`. Moreover, if the loop condition `not at_start` is true, `args` must have at least one more element. If `not at_start` is false, no additional elements are required in `args`.**
