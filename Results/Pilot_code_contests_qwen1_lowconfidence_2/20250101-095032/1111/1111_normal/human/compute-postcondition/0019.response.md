Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file`'s content is the concatenation of `str(x)` for all `x` in `args`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Conditions:**
   - The initial state specifies that `at_start` is `True`, but since the loop updates `at_start` to `False` on its first iteration, `at_start` will always be `False` after the loop executes at least once.
   - The variables `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` are not affected by the loop and retain their initial values.
   - `sep` and `file` are assigned based on the presence of keys in `kwargs` and have no changes during the loop execution unless specified otherwise.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`.
   - On the first iteration, `at_start` is `False`, so `file.write(sep)` appends `sep` to `file`.
   - Subsequent iterations append `str(x)` to `file` without adding `sep` again.
   - After all elements in `args` are processed, `args` becomes an empty list.

3. **Final State:**
   - All elements in `args` have been processed, resulting in `args` being an empty list.
   - `file` contains the concatenated string of `str(x)` for all `x` in `args`, separated by `sep`.
   - `at_start` remains `False` because it is set to `False` after the first iteration and never changed again.

Thus, the final state after the loop executes all iterations is as described above.
