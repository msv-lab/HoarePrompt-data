Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state before the loop starts:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, h)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to, but not including, `h`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration:**
   - We are given that this is the state at the end of the previous iteration. From the example, we know that `i` would have been incremented by 1 after the previous iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `h`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, if `i` was, for example, 2 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time), then for the next iteration, `i` should be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue will be that `i < h`. Therefore, `h` must still be greater than `i + 1` (which is 3 in this case).

5. **Construct the new state:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `h` must be greater than 3.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `h` must be greater than 3**
