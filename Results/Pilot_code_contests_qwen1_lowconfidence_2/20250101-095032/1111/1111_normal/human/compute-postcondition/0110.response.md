Functionality: **The function processes two lists, `r` and `c`, representing the row and column constraints for a grid of size `h` x `w`. It constructs a grid `base` where each element is initially set to 0. For each element in `r`, it marks the first `ri[i]` elements in the corresponding row as 1. Similarly, for each element in `c`, it marks the first `ci[i]` elements in the corresponding column as 1. After marking, it checks if any marked cell violates the constraints and calls `func_2(0)` if such a violation is found. If no violations are found, it counts the number of cells that do not violate the constraints and returns the result of `func_2` applied to \(2^n \mod 1000000007\), where \(n\) is the count of such cells. If no violations are found and `n` is zero, the function returns `None`.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the constraints in `r` or `c` exceed the grid dimensions (`h` or `w`), no violations are flagged, and the function proceeds to count cells and compute the result.
- If `r` or `c` contains invalid values (e.g., negative numbers or values exceeding `h` or `w`), the function assumes the constraints are within bounds and does not handle these explicitly.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly handle input validation for `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` to ensure they are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 10^3, 0 ≤ r[i] ≤ w, 0 ≤ c[i] ≤ h). This could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is out of range.
