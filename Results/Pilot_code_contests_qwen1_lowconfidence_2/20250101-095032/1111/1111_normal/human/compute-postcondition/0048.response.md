Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `ci + 1`
   - `j` is 0
   - `base[0][ci + 1]` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `ci`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `j < ci`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `ci`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0, to enter the next iteration, `j` needs to increment by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop condition.
   - `j` becomes 1.
   - The value of `base[0][ci + 1]` remains 1 because it is not modified within the loop body.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is equal to `ci + 1`, `j` is 1, `base[0][ci + 1]` is 1**
