According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `ci`. If `j` is less than `ci`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
- `base[j][0]` is 1
- `i` is 0
- `ci` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. The value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
2. The condition `j < ci` must still hold true.

Given that `ci` is greater than 1, let's assume `ci` is some value \( k \) where \( k > 1 \). At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the maximum value it could have been without causing the loop to exit, which would be \( k - 1 \).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes \( k \).
- For the loop to continue, `k` (the new value of `j`) must still be less than `ci`.

Therefore, the new state is:
- `base[j][0]` remains 1
- `i` remains 0
- `ci` remains greater than 1, but since we don't know the exact value of `ci`, we only need to ensure it's still greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`base[j][0]` is 1, `i` is 0, `ci` is greater than 1**
