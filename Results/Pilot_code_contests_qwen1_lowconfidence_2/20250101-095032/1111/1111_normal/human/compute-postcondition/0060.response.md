`func_2(0)` is called with an argument of `0`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so its behavior cannot be determined. Since no changes to the variables are explicitly shown in the code, the only thing that happens is the call to `func_2(0)`, which does not modify any of the existing variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`base[j][i]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci` and `i` is equal to the maximum value of `ci` plus 1, `h` must be greater than the maximum value of `ci` plus 1, `ci` is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop executed, and either `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1**
