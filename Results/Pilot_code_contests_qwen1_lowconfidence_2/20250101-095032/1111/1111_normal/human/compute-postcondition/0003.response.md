Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that the `kwargs` dictionary is modified by the line `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`. This sets `sep` and `file` based on the presence of the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` in `kwargs`, with default values if the keys are not present. Additionally, `at_start` is set to `True`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for x in args:` means that the loop will iterate over each element in the `args` list. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.

3. **Variables Not Affected**: The variables `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` are not mentioned as being affected by the loop itself, so their states remain as given initially.

4. **States to Adjust**: Since the loop condition depends on the existence of at least one element in `args`, we need to ensure that `args` has at least one element.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `args` must have at least one element.

The final state before the loop is:

**`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for all 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, and `args` must have at least one element.**
