According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `ci - 1`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `ci`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
- `base[j][1]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ci` must be at least 1.
- `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given these conditions, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- `ci` must be at least 1.
- `j` was incremented by 1 from its previous value, meaning if it was `j - 1` before, now it is `j`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and assuming `j` was `0` at the start of the first iteration, after one iteration, `j` would be `1`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `ci`. Since `j` is now `1`, `ci` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
- `base[j][1]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `ci` must be at least 2 (since `j` is 1 and must be less than `ci`).
- `j` is now 1.

State: **`base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `base[j][1]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `i` is 1, `ci` must be at least 2, `j` is 1**
