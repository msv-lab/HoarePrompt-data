According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop starts from 1 and goes up to `w-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is at least 2, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is 1 plus a boolean condition result (either 1 or 2), `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `w-1`, if `j` is currently 1 (the starting point), the loop can only execute one more time if `w` is at least 3.

Here are the adjustments needed:
- `w` must be at least 3 to allow `j` to go from 1 to 2.
- `h` must still be at least 1.
- `n` remains 1 plus a boolean condition result (either 1 or 2).
- `func_2(0)` is not called.
- The return statement is not executed.

State: **`w` is at least 3, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is 1 plus a boolean condition result (either 1 or 2), `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
