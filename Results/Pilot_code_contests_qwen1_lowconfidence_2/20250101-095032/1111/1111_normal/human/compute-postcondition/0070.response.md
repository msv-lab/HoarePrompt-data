The function `func_2(0)` is called, but the implementation of `func_2` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, we can state that the function call does not modify the preconditions given.

Output State: **`w` must be greater than 0, `c[i]` is an integer less than `h`, and `base[c[i]][i]` equals 1**
