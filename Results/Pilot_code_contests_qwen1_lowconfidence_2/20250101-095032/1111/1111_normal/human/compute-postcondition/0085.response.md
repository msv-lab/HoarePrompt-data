The code updates the value of `n` by adding 1 if both conditions `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` are true. However, the initial values or definitions of `r`, `j`, and `c` are not provided. Since no specific values for these variables are given, we cannot determine whether the conditions are met. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is 0, `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
