The code `base[i][j] = 1` changes the value of `base[i][j]` from its previous value, which was specified as 1 in the initial state. Since the initial state specifies that `base[i][j]` is 1, changing it to 1 again does not alter its value. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ri` is at least `i + 3`, `base[i+1][j]` where `0 ≤ j < ri - 1` (now `j + 1`) is 1, `base[i+1][j]` where `ri - 1 ≤ j < w` is 0, `base[i][j]` is 1**
