The function `func_2(0)` is called, but the implementation of `func_2` is not provided. Since no changes to variables are shown within the given code snippet, the only changes are due to the call itself. The initial conditions state that `w` must be greater than 0, `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1, and `i` is increased by 1. However, since `func_2(0)` does not modify any of these variables, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `w` must be greater than 0, `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`w` must be greater than 0, `c[i + 1]` is not less than `h` or `base[c[i + 1]][i + 1]` is not equal to 1, and `i` is increased by 1.**
