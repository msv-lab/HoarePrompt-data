Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables and Conditions**: The loop iterates over the enumerated list of `c`. Therefore, we need to consider the following:
   - `i`: This is the index of the current element in the list `c`.
   - `ci`: This is the value at the current index `i` in the list `c`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `ri` is a list of integers.
   - Each `ri[i]` is at most `w` and at least `i + h`.
   - `base[i][j]` where `0 ≤ j < ri[i]` is 1.
   - `base[i][j]` where `ri[i] ≤ j < w` is 0.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in the list `c`. Therefore, the length of `c` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop depends on the existence of elements in `c`, we need to ensure that `c` has at least one element.
   - The variable `i` should start from 0, as the loop will iterate over the enumerated list starting from index 0.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

- `c` must have at least one element.
- `i` must start from 0.

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`c` must have at least one element, `i` is 0**
