According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `ci`. If `j` is less than `ci`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `base[j][0]` is 1, `i` is 0, and `ci` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `ci`. Since `j` started from 0 and increased by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the last iteration, `j` would be 0 (because it was incremented only once and `ci` is greater than 0). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1 and `ci` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`base[j][0]` is 1, `i` is 0, `ci` is greater than 1**
