`n` is updated by adding 1 if `r[i]` is less than `j` (which is 3) and `c[j]` (which is `c[3]`) is less than `i`. However, since the exact values of `r[i]`, `c[3]`, and `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `n`. Therefore, the output state will show that `n` is updated based on the conditions, but the exact new value remains unknown.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `j` is 3, `n` is updated if `r[i] < 3 and c[3] < i`**
