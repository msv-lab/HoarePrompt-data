Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
   - `base[j][1]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ci` must be at least 1.
   - `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci`.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for j in range(ci):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range defined by `range(ci)`.
   - For each value of `j` in this range, the loop body is executed.

4. **Current Values at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ci` must be at least 1.
   - `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci`.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was within the range `0 <= j < ci`.
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is still within the range and `ci` is at least 1.
   - After the current iteration, `j` will increment by 1 (assuming the loop body does not modify `j` directly).

6. **Updated States**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `ci` must still be at least 1.
   - `j` must now be within the range `0 <= j < ci` but incremented by 1 from the previous value.

Given that `j` was previously within the range `0 <= j < ci`, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1` (assuming it hasn't been modified in the loop body). Therefore, `j` must now satisfy `0 <= j < ci` where `j` is the next integer value in the range.

So, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `base[j][1]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `i` is 1, `ci` must be at least 1, `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci` and `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

In a simplified format:
State: **`base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `base[j][1]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `i` is 1, `ci` must be at least 1, `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci` and `j` is 1 (if it was 0 before)**.

To generalize:
State: **`base[j][0]` remains 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `base[j][1]` is 1 for all valid `j` such that `0 <= j < ci`, `i` is 1, `ci` must be at least 1, `j` must be within the range `0 <= j < ci` and `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
