`n` is updated by adding 1 to its current value only if `r[i]` is less than `j` (which is 2) and `c[j]` is less than `i`. However, the specific values of `r[i]` and `c[j]` are not provided, so we cannot determine if the condition is true or false. Therefore, the exact new value of `n` cannot be determined, but we know that if the condition is true, `n` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `j` is 2, `n` is `n + 1` if `r[i] < 2 and c[2] < i`**
