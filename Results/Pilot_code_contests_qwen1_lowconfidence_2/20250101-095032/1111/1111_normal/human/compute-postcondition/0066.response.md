Postcondition: ***\(\text{base}[j][i + 1]\) is 1 for all valid \(j\) such that \(0 \leq j < c_i\). \(i\) remains unchanged, \(h\) must be greater than \(i + 1\), \(c_i\) is a non-negative integer and is at least the number of times the loop has executed. If \(\text{r}[i + 1]\) is less than \(w\) and \(\text{base}[i + 1][\text{r}[i + 1]]\) is 1, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.***
