The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by popping the values associated with the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` and assigns them to the variables `sep` and `file` respectively. If the keys are not present in `kwargs`, the default values `' '` and `sys.stdout` are used. The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`, but since the initial state does not mention `at_start`, we can assume it is not part of the initial conditions and thus remains unchanged.

The states of the other variables (`h`, `w`, `r`, `c`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for all 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`.**
