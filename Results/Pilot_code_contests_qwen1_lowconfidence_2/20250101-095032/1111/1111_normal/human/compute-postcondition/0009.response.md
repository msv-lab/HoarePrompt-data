According to the code, the loop iterates over `args`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3
- `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ w for all 1 ≤ i ≤ h
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ h for all 1 ≤ j ≤ w
- `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`
- `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`
- `at_start` is `False`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are elements left in `args` to iterate over. Since `at_start` is `False`, it means we are already inside the loop and `x` (the current element being processed) is taken from `args`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `args` must have at least one element remaining.

State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ w for all 1 ≤ i ≤ h, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ h for all 1 ≤ j ≤ w, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element remaining**
