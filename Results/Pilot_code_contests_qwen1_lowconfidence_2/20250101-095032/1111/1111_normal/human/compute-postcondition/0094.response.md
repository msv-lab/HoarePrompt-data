According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop condition is `j` being within the range of 1 to `w` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `j` is 1, and the loop can execute as `j` is within the range of 1 to `w` (exclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2 and stay within the range of 1 to `w` (exclusive). Therefore, `j` should be 2.

The other variables (`w`, `h`, and `n`) do not change based on the loop condition and remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `j` is 2**
