Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `w` is greater than 0.
   - `h` must be at least 2.
   - `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is updated if `r[i] < 2 and c[2] < i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `w`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 3.

5. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[1, w)`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `w` remains greater than 0 (no change needed).
   - `h` remains at least 2 (no change needed).
   - `n` remains an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive (no change needed since `n` is not involved in the loop condition for `j`).
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` may be updated based on the condition `r[i] < 2 and c[2] < i`, but we don't have specific values for `r[i]` and `c[2]`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `n` without additional information. However, the state of `n` does not affect the loop continuation condition for `j`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `j` is 3**
