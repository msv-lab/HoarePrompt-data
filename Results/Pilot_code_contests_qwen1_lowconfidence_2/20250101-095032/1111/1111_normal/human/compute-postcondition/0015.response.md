The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is unchanged, and the operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated file content with the appended `sep` value.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, file's content is modified by appending `str(sep)` to its current content, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least two elements remaining, `x` is an integer, `at_start` is `False`**
