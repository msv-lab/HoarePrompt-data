Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `w` is greater than 0.
- `h` must be at least 1.
- `n` is 0.
- The function `func_2(0)` is not called.
- The return statement is not executed.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(1, w):
    n += r[i] < j and c[j] < i
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = w - 1`.
- For each iteration of `j`, the expression `r[i] < j and c[j] < i` is evaluated.
- If both conditions (`r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i`) are true, `n` is incremented by 1.

### Understanding the Loop Execution:
- Since `w` is initially greater than 0, the loop will run at least once if `w` is 1. However, since `w` must be at least 2 (from the output state after the loop executes 1 time), we know the loop will run at least twice.
- After each iteration, `n` is updated based on the boolean conditions.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- The loop will run `w - 1` times because it starts from `j = 1` and goes up to `w - 1`.
- Each time the loop runs, `n` is incremented if both conditions (`r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i`) are true.
- Since the loop runs `w - 1` times, `n` can take any value from 0 to `w - 1`.

### Final Output State:
- `w` is greater than 0.
- `h` must be at least 1.
- `n` can be any integer value from 0 to `w - 1`.
- The function `func_2(0)` is not called.
- The return statement is not executed.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `func_2(0)` is not called, and the return statement is not executed.**
