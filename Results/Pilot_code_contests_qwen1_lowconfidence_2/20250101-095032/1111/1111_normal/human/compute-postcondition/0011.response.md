Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3, `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3, `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ w for all 1 ≤ i ≤ h, `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ h for all 1 ≤ j ≤ w, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is modified by appending `sep` to its current content, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element remaining***
