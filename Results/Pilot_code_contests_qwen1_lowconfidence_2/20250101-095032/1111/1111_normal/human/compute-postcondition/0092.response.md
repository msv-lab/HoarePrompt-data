State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `j` is 1, and the loop can execute as `j` is within the range of 1 to `w` (exclusive)**.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initialization of `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 because the `range(1, w)` means the loop will start from 1 and go up to `w-1`.

2. **Range Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `w`. Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, `w` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to proceed.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `w`, `h`, and `n` are mentioned but are not directly involved in the loop condition. Therefore, they don't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **Function Call:**
   - `func_2(0)` being not called and the return statement not executed is already given in the initial state and doesn't affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the state needed to adjust for the loop to execute is that `j` should be 1, and `w` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can continue executing as `j` increments through the range 1 to `w-1`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` must be at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and `w - 1` inclusive, `j` is 1, and the loop can execute as `j` is within the range of 1 to `w` (exclusive)**.
