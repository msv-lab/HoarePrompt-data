The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the context provided, it seems the function might be working with predefined variables `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` which are described in the constraints. The functionality of the function can be described as follows:

- `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\).
- `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\).
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq h\).
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq w\).

Given these constraints, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided output cases. Based on typical function descriptions, if no return statement is mentioned, it often implies that the function may perform some operation on the provided lists `r` and `c` without returning a value.

Functionality: **The function accepts predefined variables `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` with specified constraints and performs some operations on them without returning a value.**
