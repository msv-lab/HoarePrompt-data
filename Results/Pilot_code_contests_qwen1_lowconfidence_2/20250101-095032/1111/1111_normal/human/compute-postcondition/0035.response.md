The code sets `base[j][i]` to 1. Given that `i` is 0, this means `base[j][0]` is now 1. The value of `base[j][0]` was already 1, so it remains unchanged. The value of `ci` is greater than 1 and is not affected by the code. Therefore, the only change is in `base[j][0]`.

Output State: **`base[j][0]` is 1, `i` is 0, `ci` is greater than 1**
