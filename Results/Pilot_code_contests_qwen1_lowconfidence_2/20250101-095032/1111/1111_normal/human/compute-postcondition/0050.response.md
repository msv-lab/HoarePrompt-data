Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `base[j][i]` is 1.
- The for loop is: `for j in range(ci):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` using `range(ci)`.
   - This means `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `ci - 1`.

2. **Determine Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `base[j][i]` is 1.
   - This implies that the loop has already executed for some value of `j`.

3. **Determine Next Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `ci`.
   - Since the loop has already executed for one value of `j`, `j` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration was the maximum `j` it reached, say `j = k` (where `k < ci - 1`).
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Final State:**
   - Since `base[j][i]` was 1 for `j = k`, for the next iteration, `base[j][i]` will still be 1 but for `j = k + 1`.

### Conclusion
The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `base[j][i]` is 1 (for `j = k + 1`).

Given that the exact value of `k` is not specified, we generalize it as `j` being the next value after the last `j` used.

**State: **`base[j][i]` is 1, where `j` is the next value after the last `j` used in the previous iteration (i.e., `j = k + 1`)**.
