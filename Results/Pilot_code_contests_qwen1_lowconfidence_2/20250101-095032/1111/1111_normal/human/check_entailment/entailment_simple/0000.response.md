Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Initialization and Setting Up the Grid**:
   - The initial part of the code sets up the grid based on the given `r` and `c` values. However, the setup is incomplete and incorrect. Specifically, it sets the first `ri` cells in each row and the first `cj` cells in each column to be full, but it does not ensure that the rest of the cells meet the constraints defined by `r` and `c`.

2. **Checking for Invalid Configurations**:
   - The program includes checks to see if the setup violates the constraints (`r` and `c`). However, these checks are insufficient and not correctly implemented:
     ```python
     for i in range(h):
         if r[i] < w and base[i][r[i]] == 1:
             func_2(0)
             return
     ```
     - This check assumes that the grid should not have more full cells than specified in `r` or `c` beyond the first `ri` or `cj` cells. This is not correct because `r[i]` and `c[j]` define the start of consecutive full cells, not the maximum number of full cells allowed.
     - Similarly, the check:
     ```python
     for i in range(w):
         if c[i] < h and base[c[i]][i] == 1:
             func_2(0)
             return
     ```
     - This check is also flawed and not relevant to the problem constraints.

3. **Counting Valid Configurations**:
   - The next part of the code counts the number of invalid configurations where `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i`. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the actual constraints of `r` and `c` properly. It simply counts pairs `(i, j)` where the grid configuration would be invalid if extended further, which is not directly related to the problem.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation uses `pow(2, n, 1000000007)` to compute the number of valid configurations, but the variable `n` is calculated incorrectly. The count `n` should represent the number of independent choices available, but the current implementation does not correctly count these choices.

### Correct Implementation Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Ensure that the initial grid setup satisfies the `r` and `c` constraints.
- Use dynamic programming or combinatorial methods to count the valid configurations that meet the constraints.
- Ensure that the final result is computed correctly and returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required solution and hence is **Incorrect**.
