Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the given `r` and `c` values can form a valid grid. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the values of `r` and `c` are consistent with each other. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 2 0
2 0 1
```

- According to the problem description, `r` defines the number of consecutive full cells connected to the left side in each row.
- According to the problem description, `c` defines the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in each column.

For the given input:
- `r = [1, 2, 0]` means:
  - The first row starts with 1 full cell.
  - The second row starts with 2 full cells.
  - The third row starts with 0 full cells.
- `c = [2, 0, 1]` means:
  - The first column starts with 2 full cells.
  - The second column starts with 0 full cells.
  - The third column starts with 1 full cell.

To satisfy both `r` and `c`, we need a configuration like:
```
F F E
F F F
E E E
```

However, the provided program does not check for consistency between `r` and `c`. It only checks if there are any cells that violate the `r` or `c` constraints directly without ensuring the overall consistency of the grid. 

Given the inconsistency in the example above, the program would incorrectly output a result, making it incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
