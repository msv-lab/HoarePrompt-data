Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the given `r` and `c` values can form a valid grid. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the values of `r` and `c` are consistent with each other. The output hints for `func_2` indicate that it handles printing formatted strings and does not check for the validity of the grid based on the `r` and `c` values. The provided example and the problem description highlight that the program fails to validate the consistency between `r` and `c`, which is a crucial part of the problem. Therefore, the program cannot produce correct results for all inputs, and thus, it remains incorrect according to the problem description.
