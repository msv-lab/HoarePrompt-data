Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code only marks the initial positions of the full cells based on the constraints `r` and `c`, but it does not check all possible configurations of the grid to ensure that the constraints are satisfied. Instead, it prematurely calls `func_2(0)` if any marked cell violates the constraints, which is incorrect because it does not explore all valid configurations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4
0 3 1
0 2 3 0
```

The code marks the initial positions as follows:
- First row has 0 full cells, so nothing changes.
- Second row has 3 full cells, so the first three cells are marked as full.
- Third row has 1 full cell, so the first cell is marked as full.
- First column has 0 full cells, so nothing changes.
- Second column has 2 full cells, so the first two cells are marked as full.
- Third column has 3 full cells, so the first three cells are marked as full.
- Fourth column has 0 full cells, so nothing changes.

The marked grid looks like this:
```
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0
```

This configuration satisfies the initial marking, but the code does not continue to explore other valid configurations of the remaining cells. As a result, it cannot correctly compute the number of ways to fill the grid to satisfy the constraints `r` and `c`.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to use dynamic programming or backtracking to explore all possible configurations of the grid while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.
