The code updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum between its current value (if it exists) and `y + a`. Let's break this down:

- Initially, `dp2[x + cur]` is the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.
- `x` is a key from `dp1`.
- `y` is the value associated with key `x` in `dp1`.
- `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `k`, and the current value of `dp2[x + cur]` are not specified, we'll keep them as general expressions.

Therefore, the updated value of `dp2[x + cur]` is `max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)`.

Output State: **`dp1` is not an empty dictionary, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`, `dp2[x + cur]` is the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.**
