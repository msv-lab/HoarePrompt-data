The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `dp1` with a single key-value pair `(0, 0)`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `B`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `dp1` dictionary along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`dp1` is `{(0): 0}`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, the lists `a` and `b` contain n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `B` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
