The code `cur = a - b * k` updates the value of `cur` to be `a - b * k`. According to the initial state, `cur` was previously `a[0] - b[0] * k` for the next pair in the iteration. Now, `cur` is updated to `a - b * k`.

The other variables (`dp1` and `dp2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`dp1` is a dictionary containing the maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`, `dp2` is the same dictionary, `cur` is `a - b * k`**
