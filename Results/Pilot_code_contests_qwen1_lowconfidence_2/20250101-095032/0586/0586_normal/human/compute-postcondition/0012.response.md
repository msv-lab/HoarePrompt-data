According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `dp1` dictionary. The loop iterates over each key-value pair in `dp1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`, and `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged. The next key-value pair from `dp1` is about to be processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next key-value pair from `dp1` must be available. This means that there should still be key-value pairs left in `dp1`.

State: **`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`, `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged; `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair remaining to process**
