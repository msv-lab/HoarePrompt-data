To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to carefully analyze the loop code and understand how the variables change during each iteration. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `dp1` is `{(0): 0}`
- `dp2` is `{(0): 0}`
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)
- `a` and `b` contain `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive
- `B` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements
- `pos` is 0
- `cur` is `a[0] - b[0] * k`

### Loop Code:
```python
for x, y in dp1.iteritems():
    dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a[0])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `x` and `y` are taken from `dp1`.
   - `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a[0]`.
   - `cur` remains unchanged (`cur = a[0] - b[0] * k`).

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The next key-value pair from `dp1` is processed.
   - `dp2[x + cur]` is updated again to the maximum of its current value and `y + a[0]`.
   - `cur` remains unchanged.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - The next key-value pair from `dp1` is processed.
   - `dp2[x + cur]` is updated again to the maximum of its current value and `y + a[0]`.
   - `cur` remains unchanged.

### General Iteration:
- Each iteration updates `dp2` using the same `cur` value (`a[0] - b[0] * k`).
- The key `x + cur` is used to update the value in `dp2`.
- The value `y + a[0]` is compared with the current value of `dp2[x + cur]` and the maximum is stored.

### Final Output State:

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop will have processed all key-value pairs in `dp1`. Since `dp1` initially only contains one key-value pair `(0, 0)`, the loop will update `dp2` based on this single key-value pair.

- `dp1` will be empty because all key-value pairs have been processed.
- `dp2` will be updated with the maximum values for keys of the form `x + cur`, where `x` was the key in `dp1` and `cur` is `a[0] - b[0] * k`.

### Output State:

- `dp1` will be an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `dp2` will contain the maximum values for keys of the form `x + cur`, where `x` was the key in `dp1` and `cur` is `a[0] - b[0] * k`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`dp1` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `dp2` is a dictionary containing the maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`, where `x` was the key in `dp1` and `cur` is `a[0] - b[0] * k`.**
