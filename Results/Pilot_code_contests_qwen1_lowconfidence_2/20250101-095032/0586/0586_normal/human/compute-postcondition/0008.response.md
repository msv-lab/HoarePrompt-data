Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `dp1` is `{(0): 0}`
- `dp2` is `{(0): 0}`
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10
- `a` and `b` contain `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive
- `B` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements
- `pos` is 0
- `cur` is `a - b * k`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if there are key-value pairs in `dp1`.
2. **dp1**: The initial state of `dp1` is `{(0): 0}`. This means `dp1` currently has one key-value pair, specifically `(0, 0)`.
3. **Key-Value Pairs**: The loop iterates over all key-value pairs in `dp1`. Since `dp1` already contains one pair, the loop will definitely execute.

### Conclusion:
Given that `dp1` already contains a key-value pair and the loop condition is satisfied by this pair, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given states.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts does not need any adjustments because the loop will execute as long as `dp1` contains at least one key-value pair, which it does initially.

**State:**
State: **`dp1` is `{(0): 0}`, `dp2` is `{(0): 0}`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, `a` and `b` contain `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `B` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `pos` is 0, `cur` is `a - b * k`**
