The line `dp1 = dp2` assigns the value of `dp2` to `dp1`. This means that `dp1` will now reference the same dictionary object as `dp2`. The content of `dp1` will be updated to match the content of `dp2`, which is a dictionary containing the maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`.

The initial state of `dp2` is specified as a dictionary containing the maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`. Since `dp1` is now referencing this same dictionary, `dp1` will also contain the same maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`.

The variable `cur` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code provided. The precondition that `cur` is `a[0] - b[0] * k` is still valid.

Output State: **`dp1` is a dictionary containing the maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`, `dp2` is the same dictionary, `cur` is `a[0] - b[0] * k`.**
