`cur` is assigned the value `a - b * k`. The variables `dp1`, `dp2`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, and `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.

Output State: **`dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, and `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.**
