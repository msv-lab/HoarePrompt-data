The code `dp1 = dp2` assigns the dictionary `dp2` to the variable `dp1`. This means that `dp1` now references the same dictionary object as `dp2`, and any changes made to `dp1` will also affect `dp2`.

Before the code was executed, `dp1` had at least one key-value pair, and `x` was a key from `dp1` with a corresponding value `y`. However, since `dp1` now references `dp2`, the content of `dp2` (and thus `dp1`) will be updated according to the condition given in the initial state.

The initial state specified that `dp2[x + cur]` would be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a` for every key-value pair in `dp1`. Since `dp1` now points to `dp2`, this operation will be performed on `dp2` itself.

However, the code only assigns `dp2` to `dp1` without performing the additional updates. Thus, the updates specified in the initial state are not performed here.

Therefore, the only change is that `dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`. The states of other variables (`x`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, and `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a` for every key-value pair in `dp1` but this update is not performed by the given code.**
