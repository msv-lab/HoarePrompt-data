Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp2[x + cur]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp2[x + cur]` (if it exists) and `y + a`.
   - The values of `dp1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each key-value pair `(x, y)` in `dp1`.
   - For each iteration, `x` is the current key from `dp1`, and `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are more key-value pairs in `dp1`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `dp1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged within the loop, we only need to adjust the state of `dp2`.
   - After processing each `(x, y)` pair, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `dp1` must still have at least one key-value pair because the loop continues until all pairs are processed.
   - `x` is the first key from `dp1` in the next iteration.
   - `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1` for that key.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first key from `dp1`, and `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`.

**Final State:**
- **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`; `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.**

State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1; dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.**
