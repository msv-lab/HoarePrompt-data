Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp1` is not an empty dictionary.
   - `x` is a key from `dp1`.
   - `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`.
   - `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.
   - `dp2[x + cur]` is the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each key-value pair `(x, y)` in `dp1`.
   - For each iteration, it updates `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.

3. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop iterates over all keys in `dp1`, the only thing that changes is the key `x` and the value `y` being processed.
   - The variable `cur` is calculated based on the constants `a` and `b` and the constant `k`, and it does not change within the loop.
   - The updated state of `dp2` is based on the current `x` and `y` values.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `dp1` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `x` and `y` will be different since the loop processes each key-value pair.
   - `cur` remains the same as it is calculated once per loop execution.

5. **Identifying the New Key-Value Pair:**
   - The next key-value pair `(x', y')` will be the next item in the iteration of `dp1`.
   - Therefore, `x'` will be the next key after `x` in `dp1`, and `y'` will be the corresponding value.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - The state needs to reflect the new key-value pair `(x', y')` being processed.
   - `dp2[x' + cur]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `y' + a`.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`dp1` is not an empty dictionary, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`, `dp2[x + cur]` is the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`, and the next iteration will process the next key-value pair `(x', y')` in `dp1` where `x'` is the next key and `y'` is the corresponding value.**

State: **`dp1` is not an empty dictionary, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`, `dp2[x + cur]` is the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`, and the next iteration will process the next key-value pair `(x', y')` in `dp1` where `x'` is the next key and `y'` is the corresponding value.**
