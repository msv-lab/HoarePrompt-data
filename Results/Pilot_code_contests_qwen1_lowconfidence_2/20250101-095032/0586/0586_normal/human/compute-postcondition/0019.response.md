Let's break down the given state and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `dp1` is a dictionary containing the maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`.
- `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`.
- `cur` is `a - b * k`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Dictionary `dp1`:**
   - The dictionary `dp1` contains key-value pairs where the keys are of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)` and the values are some values (not specified in the problem but typically maximum values).

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the items in `dp1` using `iteritems()`. This method returns key-value pairs from the dictionary.
   - For the loop to execute, `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair.

3. **States to Adjust:**
   - We need to ensure that `dp1` has at least one key-value pair before the loop starts.
   - Additionally, we need to specify the initial values of `x` and `y` for the first iteration of the loop.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair.
- `x` and `y` must be the first key-value pair from `dp1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`**
