The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. Additionally, the function accepts two lists: `a` and `b`. List `a` contains `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, representing the tastes of the fruits. List `b` contains `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, representing the calories of the fruits.

Case_1: The function returns the sum of the first `k` elements in list `a`.
Case_2: The function returns the sum of the first `k` elements in list `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10), along with two lists `a` and `b` containing positive integers within specified ranges, and return either the sum of the first `k` elements in list `a` or the sum of the first `k` elements in list `b`.
