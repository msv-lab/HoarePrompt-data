The code `cur = a - b * k` assigns the value of `a - b * k` to the variable `cur`. Here, `a` and `b` are lists containing `n` positive integers each, and `k` is a positive integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not specified in detail, but they are used in the calculation. The value of `dp1` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` is `{(0): 0}`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, `a` and `b` contain `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `B` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `pos` is 0, `cur` is `a - b * k`**
