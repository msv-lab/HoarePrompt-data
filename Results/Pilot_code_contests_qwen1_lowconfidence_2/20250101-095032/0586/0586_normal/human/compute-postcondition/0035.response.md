The code updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `x` and `y` are keys and values from `dp1`.
2. `cur` is defined as `a - b * k`.
3. `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.

After the code is executed, the following changes occur:
- `dp2[x + cur]` is now set to `max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)`.
- The values of `dp1`, `x`, `y`, `cur`, and the next key-value pair `(x', y')` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`dp1` is not an empty dictionary, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`, `dp2[x + cur]` is the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`, and the next iteration will process the next key-value pair `(x', y')` in `dp1` where `x'` is the next key and `y'` is the corresponding value.**
