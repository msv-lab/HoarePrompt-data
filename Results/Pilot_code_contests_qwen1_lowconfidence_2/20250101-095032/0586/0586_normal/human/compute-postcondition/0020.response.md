`dp2[x + cur]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp2[x + cur]` (if it exists) and `y + a`. The values of `dp1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`; `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.**
