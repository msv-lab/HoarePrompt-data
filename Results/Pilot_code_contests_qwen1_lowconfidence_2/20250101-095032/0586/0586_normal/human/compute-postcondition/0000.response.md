`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The lists `a` and `b` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10; the lists `a` and `b` contain n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive.

Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10; the lists `a` and `b` contain n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
