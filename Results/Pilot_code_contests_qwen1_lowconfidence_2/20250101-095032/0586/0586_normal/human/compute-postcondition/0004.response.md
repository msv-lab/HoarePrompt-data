The code `pos = 0` initializes the variable `pos` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`dp1` is `{(0): 0}`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, the lists `a` and `b` contain n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `B` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pos` is 0**
