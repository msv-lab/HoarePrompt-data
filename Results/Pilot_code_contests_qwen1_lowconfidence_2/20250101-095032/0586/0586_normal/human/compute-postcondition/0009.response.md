The given code snippet updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. However, since no initial values for `dp2`, `x`, `cur`, `y`, or `a` are provided, we can only describe the impact on these variables.

- `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.
- `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`; `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
