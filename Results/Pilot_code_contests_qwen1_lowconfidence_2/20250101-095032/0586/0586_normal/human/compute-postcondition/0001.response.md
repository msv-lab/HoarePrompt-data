The code `A = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `A`. This means that the original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the variable `k` also remains unchanged. The variable `n` remains unchanged because the code does not refer to it in any way. The output state is therefore:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10; the lists `a` and `b` contain n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
