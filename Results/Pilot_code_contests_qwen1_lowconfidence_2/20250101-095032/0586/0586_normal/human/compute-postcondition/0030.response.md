Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over key-value pairs in the dictionary `dp1`.
   - The loop variable `(x, y)` represents each key-value pair in the dictionary.
   - The loop can only execute if `dp1` contains at least one key-value pair.

2. **Current States:**
   - `dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`.
   - `x` is a key from `dp1`.
   - `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`.
   - `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `dp1` must contain at least one key-value pair. This means `dp1` cannot be an empty dictionary.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `x` and `y` are specific to the keys and values within `dp1`, they will be adjusted based on the contents of `dp1`.
   - We need to ensure that `dp1` is not empty.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `dp1` must not be an empty dictionary.

**State: **`dp1` is not an empty dictionary, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, and `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.**
