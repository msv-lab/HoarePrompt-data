Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`, along with two lists `a` and `b` containing `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, representing the tastes and calories of the fruits, respectively. The function calculates a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum possible taste difference (`taste - calorie*k`) that can be achieved by selecting a subset of fruits such that the total calorie does not exceed zero. If such a subset exists, the function prints the maximum taste difference; otherwise, it prints -1.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality included:**
- The function does not explicitly check if `n` and `k` are within the specified bounds, though it assumes valid input based on the problem constraints.
- The function uses `defaultdict` for dynamic programming, which ensures that missing keys have a default value of 0, making the code cleaner but not strictly necessary given the problem constraints.
- The function correctly handles the case where no valid subset exists (i.e., `dp1[0]` is not greater than 0), printing -1 in such scenarios.
- The function does not return a value directly; instead, it prints the result, which is a common pattern in problems involving console output.
