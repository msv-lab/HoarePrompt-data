`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. The values of `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged. The precondition that `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair remaining to process is also still valid.

Output State: **`dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`, `x`, `cur`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged, `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair remaining to process.**
