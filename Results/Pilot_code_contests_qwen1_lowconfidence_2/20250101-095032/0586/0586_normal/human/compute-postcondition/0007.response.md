`dp2` is assigned the value of `dp1.copy()`, which means `dp2` is a copy of the dictionary `dp1`. The initial value of `dp1` is `{(0): 0}`, so `dp2` will also be `{(0): 0}`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` is `{(0): 0}`, `dp2` is `{(0): 0}`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, `a` and `b` contain `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `B` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `pos` is 0, `cur` is `a - b * k`**
