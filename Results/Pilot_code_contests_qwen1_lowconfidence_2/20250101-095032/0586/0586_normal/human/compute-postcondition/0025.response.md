Output State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`; `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a` for every key-value pair in `dp1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each key-value pair in `dp1`.
- For each key-value pair `(x, y)`, the loop updates `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.
- Since the loop processes every key-value pair in `dp1`, the final state of `dp2` will reflect these updates for all pairs.
- `dp1` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `cur` is updated based on `a - b * k`, but its value does not affect the final state of `dp2` directly since it is only used in the update condition.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `dp1` is empty), then both `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged, and their initial values are preserved.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a` for every key-value pair in `dp1`.
