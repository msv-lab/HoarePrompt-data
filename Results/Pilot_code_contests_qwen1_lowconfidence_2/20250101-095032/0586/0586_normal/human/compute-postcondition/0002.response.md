The code `B = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to `B`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the lists `a` and `b` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10; the lists `a` and `b` contain n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `B` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
