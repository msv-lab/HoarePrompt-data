`dp2` is assigned the copy of `dp1`. This means that `dp2` will contain the same key-value pairs as `dp1`. The original values of `dp1` and `cur` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp1` is a dictionary containing the maximum values for keys of the form `x + (a[0] - b[0] * k)`, `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`, `cur` is `a - b * k`**
