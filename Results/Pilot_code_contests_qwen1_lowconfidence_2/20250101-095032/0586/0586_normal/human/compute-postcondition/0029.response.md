`dp2` is assigned the copy of `dp1`. This means that both `dp1` and `dp2` reference the same dictionary before this operation. The value of `x` is still a key from `dp1`, and `y` is still the corresponding value from `dp1`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged and is still equal to `a - b * k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, and `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.

Output State: **`dp1` now references the same dictionary as `dp2`, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, and `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`.**
