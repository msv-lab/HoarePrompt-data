The line `dp1 = dp2` assigns the entire `dp2` dictionary to `dp1`. This means that `dp1` now references the same dictionary object as `dp2`. The contents of `dp1` before the assignment (i.e., the keys and their associated values) are lost and replaced with the contents of `dp2`.

After the assignment, the following holds true:
- `dp1` now references the dictionary that `dp2` references.
- `x` is a key from `dp1`.
- `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1` (which is actually the same value as the one from `dp2` because `dp1` now points to `dp2`).
- `cur` remains unchanged and is still equal to `a - b * k`.
- For every key `x` in `dp1` (now `dp2`), `dp2[x + cur]` contains the maximum value between its original value and `y + a` for all key-value pairs processed in the loop.

Output State: **`dp1` references the same dictionary as `dp2`; `x` is a key from `dp1`; `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`; `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`; for every key `x` in `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` contains the maximum value between its original value and `y + a` for all key-value pairs processed in the loop.**
