The code updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. The values of `dp1`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Let's break it down:

- `dp1` is an initial dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
- `x` is the second key from `dp1`.
- `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`.
- `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.

After the code execution, the only change is in `dp2[x + cur]`.

Output State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the second key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`**
