The code updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `x` is the first key from `dp1`.
2. `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`.
3. `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.

After executing the code, the value of `dp2[x + cur]` will be updated to the maximum of its original value and `y + a`. The other variables (`dp1`, `x`, `y`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `y + a`.**
