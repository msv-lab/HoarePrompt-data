`dp2[x + cur]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp2[x + cur]` (if it exists) and `y + a`. Here, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, and `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp1` is not an empty dictionary, `x` is a key from `dp1`, `y` is the corresponding value from `dp1`, `cur` is equal to `a - b * k`, `dp2[x + cur]` is the maximum value between its current value (if it exists) and `y + a`.**
