Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits while maintaining the required ratio \( \frac{\text{total taste}}{\text{total calories}} = k \) is flawed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of Dynamic Programming:**
   - The dynamic programming approach used here does not correctly model the problem. The key issue is that the state transitions do not account for the requirement that the ratio of the total taste to the total calories must be exactly \( k \). Instead, the code attempts to maximize the taste while ensuring the difference between the total taste and the total calories scaled by \( k \) is within a certain range. However, this approach does not ensure that the final ratio is exactly \( k \).

2. **Incorrect State Transition Logic:**
   - The state transition logic in the `for` loop does not correctly handle the constraint that the ratio must be exactly \( k \). The current implementation updates the DP table with differences (`cur = a - b * k`), which does not guarantee that the final solution will maintain the exact ratio \( k \).

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where no valid subset of fruits can satisfy the exact ratio \( k \). The output should be \(-1\) in such cases, but the program does not correctly identify these situations.

To correctly solve this problem, a more appropriate approach would involve using a modified version of the Knapsack problem with constraints. Here is a high-level outline of a correct approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**
   - Initialize a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum taste achievable with a total calorie sum of `j` using the first `i` fruits.

2. **State Transition:**
   - For each fruit, update the DP table while ensuring the ratio constraint is maintained.

3. **Check for Validity:**
   - Ensure that the solution found maintains the exact ratio \( k \).

Given the flaws in the provided solution, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
