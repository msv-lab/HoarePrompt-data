Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum taste of the chosen fruits such that the total taste to total calories ratio equals \( k \). The dynamic programming approach used in the code aims to maximize the taste difference (\( \text{taste} - \text{calories} \cdot k \)) rather than directly finding the maximum taste under the given ratio constraint.

To properly solve the problem, the code needs to consider the ratio of taste to calories directly. Specifically, it should maintain a state that tracks the maximum taste for a given deficit (or excess) of calories relative to the target ratio \( k \). The current implementation does not correctly handle this requirement, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1
```
The correct output should be 18, as explained in the example. However, the provided code would not yield this result because it does not correctly track the maximum taste while maintaining the required ratio.

A correct solution would involve maintaining a DP table or a similar structure to keep track of the maximum taste for each possible deficit or excess of calories relative to the target ratio \( k \). This ensures that the code correctly identifies the subset of fruits that meet the specified ratio while maximizing the total taste.
