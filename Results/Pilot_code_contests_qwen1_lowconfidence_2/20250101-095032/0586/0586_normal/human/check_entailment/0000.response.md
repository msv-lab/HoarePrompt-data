Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It uses a dictionary `dp1` to store the maximum taste value that can be achieved for each possible difference between taste and calories multiplied by `k`. The program iterates through each fruit, updating the `dp` table to reflect the new maximum taste values that can be achieved by including the current fruit. If a valid solution is found (i.e., a way to achieve a difference of 0 with a positive taste value), the program outputs the maximum taste value. If no such solution exists, it outputs `-1`.

The program handles all the given examples correctly:
1. For the first example, the program outputs `18`, which is the correct maximum taste value when choosing fruits with taste `10` and `8` and calories `2` and `7` respectively.
2. For the second example, the program correctly outputs `-1`, indicating that no valid combination of fruits exists.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all the provided examples without errors, it is correct for the given problem description.
