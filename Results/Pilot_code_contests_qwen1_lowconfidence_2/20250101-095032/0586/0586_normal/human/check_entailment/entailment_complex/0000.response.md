Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input according to the problem statement. It reads `n` and `k` from the first line, followed by the tastes `a` and calories `b` of the fruits from the subsequent lines. This matches the expected input format.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes a dictionary `dp1` to keep track of the maximum taste difference achievable with a given net calorie difference (`cur`). For each fruit, it updates the `dp2` dictionary to reflect the new possible taste differences considering the current fruit. This ensures that the program considers all possible subsets of fruits while adhering to the constraint that the total calorie difference must be zero or less.

3. **State Transitions**: The program iterates through each fruit, updating the state transitions correctly. It calculates `cur` as `a - b * k`, which represents the adjusted taste difference for the current fruit. It then updates `dp2` to include the new state transitions based on adding the current fruit to previously considered states.

4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all fruits, the program checks if there is any non-zero state in `dp1` that indicates a valid solution (i.e., a subset of fruits that satisfies the condition). If such a state exists, it prints the corresponding taste difference; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where no valid subset exists by checking if `dp1[0]` is greater than zero. If not, it correctly outputs `-1`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum taste difference of the chosen fruits under the given constraints, matching the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
