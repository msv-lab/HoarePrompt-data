You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. 

Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, <image> , where aj is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and bj is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100) — the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste ai and calories bi.

Output

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

Examples

Input

3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1


Output

18


Input

5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2


Output

-1

Note

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition <image> fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = map(int, raw_input().split())
    B = map(int, raw_input().split())
    dp1 = defaultdict(lambda : 0, {0: 0})
    pos = 0
    for (a, b) in zip(A, B):
        cur = a - b * k
        dp2 = dp1.copy()
        for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():
            dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)
        dp1 = dp2
    if dp1[0] > 0:
        print(dp1[0])
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It uses a dictionary `dp1` to store the maximum taste value that can be achieved for each possible difference between taste and calories multiplied by `k`. The program iterates through each fruit, updating the `dp` table to reflect the new maximum taste values that can be achieved by including the current fruit. If a valid solution is found (i.e., a way to achieve a difference of 0 with a positive taste value), the program outputs the maximum taste value. If no such solution exists, it outputs `-1`.

The program handles all the given examples correctly:
1. For the first example, the program outputs `18`, which is the correct maximum taste value when choosing fruits with taste `10` and `8` and calories `2` and `7` respectively.
2. For the second example, the program correctly outputs `-1`, indicating that no valid combination of fruits exists.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all the provided examples without errors, it is correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. The list `a` contains n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, representing the tastes of the fruits. The list `b` contains n positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, representing the calories of the fruits.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = map(int, raw_input().split())
    B = map(int, raw_input().split())
    dp1 = defaultdict(lambda : 0, {(0): 0})
    pos = 0
    for (a, b) in zip(A, B):
        cur = a - b * k
        
        dp2 = dp1.copy()
        
        for x, y in dp1.iteritems():
            dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)
        
        dp1 = dp2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    if (dp1[0] > 0) :
        print(dp1[0])
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`dp1` is a list of integers. If `dp1[0]` is greater than 0, the value of `dp1[0]` is printed. If `dp1[0]` is not greater than 0, -1 is printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
