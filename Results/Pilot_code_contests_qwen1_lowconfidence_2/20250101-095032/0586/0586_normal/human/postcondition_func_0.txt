The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`, along with two lists `a` and `b` containing `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive, representing the tastes and calories of the fruits, respectively. The function calculates a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum possible taste difference (`taste - calorie*k`) that can be achieved by selecting a subset of fruits such that the total calorie does not exceed zero. If such a subset exists, the function prints the maximum taste difference; otherwise, it prints -1.
