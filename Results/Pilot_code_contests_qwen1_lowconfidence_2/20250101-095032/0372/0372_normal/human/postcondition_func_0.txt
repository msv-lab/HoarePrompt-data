The function `func()` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the user where `3 <= n <= 1000`. The function then iterates through all integers `i` from 0 to `n//2 - 1` and checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n - i` and `i` is 1. If the condition is met, it prints the pair `(i, n - i)`. After the loop, if no such pairs exist, the function ends without printing anything. The final state of the program is that either all valid pairs `(i, n - i)` where `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` have been printed, or no output is generated if no such pairs exist.
