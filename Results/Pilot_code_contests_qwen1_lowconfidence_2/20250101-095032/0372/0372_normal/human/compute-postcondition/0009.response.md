The code prints the concatenation of the string representation of `i` and the string representation of `n - i`. The value of `i` is 3, and since `i` is less than `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 6. However, `n` is also an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive. The output of the print statement will be a string combining the values of `i` and `n - i`.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is an integer between 7 and 1000 inclusive; the output is the string '3 ' followed by the string representation of `n - 3`**
