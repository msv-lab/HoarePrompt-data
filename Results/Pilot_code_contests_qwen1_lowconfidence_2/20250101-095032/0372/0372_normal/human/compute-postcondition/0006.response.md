The code `print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))` concatenates the string representation of `i` and `n - i` and prints them. This does not change the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be a string in the format "2 (value of n - 2)", but the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2**
