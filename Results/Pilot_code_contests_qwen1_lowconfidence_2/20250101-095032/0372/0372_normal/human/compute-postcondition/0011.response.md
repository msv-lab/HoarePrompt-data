Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is either `n // 2` or the last value of `i` for which `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` was true, and the output consists of all pairs `(i, n - i)` such that `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`. If no such pairs exist, `i` will be `n // 2` and no output will be generated.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs for `i` from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`.
2. **GCD Condition**: For each `i`, the condition `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` is checked.
3. **Output Generation**: If the condition is true, the pair `(i, n - i)` is printed.
4. **Final Value of `i`**:
   - If the loop does not find any `i` such that `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`, the final value of `i` will be `n // 2`.
   - If there are valid pairs, the loop will terminate just after the last valid `i` where the condition holds true.
5. **No Output Case**: If no such pairs exist, the loop will not generate any output, and the final value of `i` will be `n // 2`.

Given these observations, the final state of the variables `n` and `i` and the output of the program can be summarized as above.
