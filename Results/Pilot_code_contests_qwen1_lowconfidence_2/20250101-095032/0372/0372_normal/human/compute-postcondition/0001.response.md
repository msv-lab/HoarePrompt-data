State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive.

For the loop `for i in range(n / 2):` to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. The value of `n` must be such that `n / 2` results in a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. The variable `i` should start from 0 and increment by 1 during each iteration of the loop.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Value of `n`:**
   - `n` must be at least 2 for `n / 2` to result in a positive integer.
   - Since `n` is given to be an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, we can confirm that `n / 2` will always result in a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Initial value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` as 0 (the starting point of the range function when no start parameter is specified).
   - The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n / 2`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range and that `i` starts at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0**
