The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the constraint that `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 1000`.

However, since no specific output logic is provided in the given information, we can only state that the function will return some value when called, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.

Functionality: **The function returns a value when called, without accepting any parameters, where the internal constraint for `n` is `3 <= n <= 1000`.**
