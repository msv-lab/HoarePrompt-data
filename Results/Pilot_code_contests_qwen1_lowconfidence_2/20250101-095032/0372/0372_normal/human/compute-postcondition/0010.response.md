Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 3. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n - i` and `i` is 1, then the output is the string '3 ' followed by the string representation of `n - 3`. If the gcd condition is not met, the program does not change the value of `n` or `i`.***
