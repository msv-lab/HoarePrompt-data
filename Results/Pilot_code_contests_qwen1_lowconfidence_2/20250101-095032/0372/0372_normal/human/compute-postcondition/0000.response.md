`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The raw_input() function reads a line from input (which is usually keyboard input) and returns it as a string. The int() function then converts this string into an integer. Since the input is within the range 3 to 1000 (inclusive), the value of `n` will be an integer in this range.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive**
