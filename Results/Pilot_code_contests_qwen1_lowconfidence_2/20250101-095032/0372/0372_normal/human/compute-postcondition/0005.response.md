Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The condition `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` is checked, and if true, the program outputs `'0 ' + str(n)` and does nothing else.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n // 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` remains the same as before (since the loop body is omitted and no modification is made to `n`).
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.

4. **Current Values**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the start, after the first iteration, `i` would be 1.
   - For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n // 2`.
   - Given that `i` is now 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.

6. **Next State**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.

Given these steps, we need to ensure that the state allows for the next iteration of the loop.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 2.
- `i` must be less than `n // 2` for the loop to continue.

Since `n` could be any value between 3 and 1000, we need to keep `n` as a variable within its original range, but `i` is specifically set to 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `n // 2`**
