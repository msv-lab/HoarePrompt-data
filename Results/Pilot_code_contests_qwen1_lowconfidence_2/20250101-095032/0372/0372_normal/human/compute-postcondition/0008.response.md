According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `i` is less than `n // 2`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i + 1` is still less than `n // 2`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, `i + 1` would be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `3` must be less than `n // 2`.

Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `n // 2` will be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. Therefore, as long as `n // 2` is greater than 3, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 3, and `i` is less than `n // 2`.**
