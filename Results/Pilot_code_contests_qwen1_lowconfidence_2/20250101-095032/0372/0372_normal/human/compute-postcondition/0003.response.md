The code prints the concatenation of the strings representing `i` and `n - i`. The values of `i` and `n - i` are determined as follows: `i` is initially 0 and `n - i` is `n` (since `i` is 0). The greatest common divisor (gcd) condition is met because gcd(`n - i`, `i`) = gcd(`n`, 0) = `n` (which is between 3 and 1000), and any number's gcd with 0 is itself.

The code does not change the values of the variables; it only prints them. After the print statement executes, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the printed values and the unchanged values of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, and the output of the program is '0 ' + str(n)**
