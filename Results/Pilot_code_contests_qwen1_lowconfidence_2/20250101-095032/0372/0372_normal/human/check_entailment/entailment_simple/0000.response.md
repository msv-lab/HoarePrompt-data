Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program is designed to find all pairs \((i, n-i)\) such that \( \text{gcd}(n-i, i) == 1 \) and outputs these pairs. However, the problem requires finding **the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction** \(\frac{a}{b}\) such that \(a + b = n\).

#### Issues:
1. **Output Format**: The program outputs all valid pairs \((i, n-i)\) where \(\text{gcd}(n-i, i) == 1\). However, the problem asks for **only one pair** that represents the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.

2. **Maximizing the Fraction**: The program does not ensure that it selects the pair \((i, n-i)\) that maximizes the fraction \(\frac{i}{n-i}\). It simply prints all pairs that satisfy the gcd condition, which does not guarantee the maximum fraction.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate through possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor\).
- Check if \(\text{gcd}(n-i, i) == 1\).
- Track the pair \((i, n-i)\) that provides the highest value of \(\frac{i}{n-i}\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_a = 0
    max_b = n
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            if i / (n - i) > max_a / max_b:
                max_a = i
                max_b = n - i
    print(max_a, max_b)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Why the Corrected Program is Correct:
- It iterates through all possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor\).
- It checks the gcd condition.
- It keeps track of the pair \((i, n-i)\) that provides the highest value of \(\frac{i}{n-i}\).
- Finally, it prints the pair \((max_a, max_b)\), ensuring that the output is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.
