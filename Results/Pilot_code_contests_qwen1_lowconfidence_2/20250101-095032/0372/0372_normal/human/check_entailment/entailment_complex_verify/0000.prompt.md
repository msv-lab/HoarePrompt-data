You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction <image> is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a < b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1).

During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button ( + ) instead of division button (÷) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to n instead of the expected decimal notation. 

Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That's why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction <image> such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals n. Help Petya deal with this problem.

Input

In the only line of input there is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the sum of numerator and denominator of the fraction.

Output

Output two space-separated positive integers a and b, numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.

            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the greatest common divisor (gcd) check fails to find a pair that satisfies the conditions for a proper irreducible fraction. Specifically, for the input `n = 12`, the program should output `5 7` because it is the largest possible proper irreducible fraction where the sum of the numerator and denominator is 12. However, the current implementation may miss this pair due to the loop structure. The loop runs until `i` reaches `n / 2`, which is `6` in this case, and the gcd check may not find `5` and `7` as a valid pair because the loop condition checks up to `n / 2 - 1`. Therefore, the program does not guarantee finding the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction for all inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from fractions import gcd

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(n / 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is either `n // 2` or the last value of `i` for which `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` was true, and the output consists of all pairs `(i, n - i)` such that `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`. If no such pairs exist, `i` will be `n // 2` and no output will be generated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the user where `3 <= n <= 1000`. The function then iterates through all integers `i` from 0 to `n//2 - 1` and checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n - i` and `i` is 1. If the condition is met, it prints the pair `(i, n - i)`. After the loop, if no such pairs exist, the function ends without printing anything. The final state of the program is that either all valid pairs `(i, n - i)` where `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` have been printed, or no output is generated if no such pairs exist.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
