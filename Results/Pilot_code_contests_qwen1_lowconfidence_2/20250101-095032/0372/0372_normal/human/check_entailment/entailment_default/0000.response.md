Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction where the sum of the numerator and denominator equals `n`. Specifically, the program attempts to find a pair `(i, n - i)` where `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`, but it does not ensure that the fraction is proper (i.e., the numerator is less than the denominator). This can lead to incorrect outputs, especially for certain values of `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 12`. According to the problem description, the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction is `5/7`. However, the program will print `6 6` because it finds that `gcd(6, 6) == 6`, which is true, and `6` is within the range `0` to `12 // 2 - 1`. But `6/6` is not a proper fraction, and the correct output should be `5 7`.

Additionally, the program does not explicitly check if the fraction is proper, which is a critical requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
