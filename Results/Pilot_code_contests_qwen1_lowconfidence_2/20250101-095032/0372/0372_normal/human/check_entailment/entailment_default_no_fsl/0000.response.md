Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to `n`. The code iterates through all integers `i` from 0 to `n//2 - 1` and checks if the GCD of `n - i` and `i` is 1, which is correct. However, it does not ensure that the fraction is proper (i.e., the numerator is less than the denominator). In the examples provided:

- For `n = 3`, the code prints `1 2`, which is correct.
- For `n = 4`, the code prints `1 3`, which is also correct.
- For `n = 12`, the code prints `5 7`, which is also correct.

However, the code does not explicitly check that the fraction is proper. It should ensure that `i < n - i` to guarantee that the fraction is proper. Without this check, the code could potentially print improper fractions, which would violate the problem constraints. Since the code does not include this check, it is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
