Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the correct output. For example, consider the input `n = 12`. According to the problem description, the expected output is `5 7` because it is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to 12. However, the program will output `5 7` for `n = 12`, which seems correct at first glance, but let's test another value to confirm.

For `n = 13`, the correct output should be `6 7` because 6 + 7 = 13 and 6/7 is a proper irreducible fraction. But the program will output `6 7` as well, which is also correct in this case. However, for `n = 14`, the correct output should be `6 8` because 6 + 8 = 14 and 6/8 is not in its simplest form (it simplifies to 3/4), but 3/4 is the maximum proper irreducible fraction for n = 14. The program will output `6 8`, which is incorrect because 6/8 is not in its simplest form and 3/4 is the correct answer.

Therefore, the program does not handle the simplification of fractions properly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
