You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction <image> is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a < b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1).

During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button ( + ) instead of division button (÷) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to n instead of the expected decimal notation. 

Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That's why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction <image> such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals n. Help Petya deal with this problem.

Input

In the only line of input there is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the sum of numerator and denominator of the fraction.

Output

Output two space-separated positive integers a and b, numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.

            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the correct output. For example, consider the input `n = 12`. According to the problem description, the expected output is `5 7` because it is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum up to 12. However, the program will output `5 7` for `n = 12`, which seems correct at first glance, but let's test another value to confirm.

For `n = 13`, the correct output should be `6 7` because 6 + 7 = 13 and 6/7 is a proper irreducible fraction. But the program will output `6 7` as well, which is also correct in this case. However, for `n = 14`, the correct output should be `6 8` because 6 + 8 = 14 and 6/8 is not in its simplest form (it simplifies to 3/4), but 3/4 is the maximum proper irreducible fraction for n = 14. The program will output `6 8`, which is incorrect because 6/8 is not in its simplest form and 3/4 is the correct answer.

Therefore, the program does not handle the simplification of fractions properly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the user where `3 <= n <= 1000`. The function then iterates through all integers `i` from 0 to `n//2 - 1` and checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n - i` and `i` is 1. If the condition is met, it prints the pair `(i, n - i)`. After the loop, if no such pairs exist, the function ends without printing anything. The final state of the program is that either all valid pairs `(i, n - i)` where `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` have been printed, or no output is generated if no such pairs exist.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
