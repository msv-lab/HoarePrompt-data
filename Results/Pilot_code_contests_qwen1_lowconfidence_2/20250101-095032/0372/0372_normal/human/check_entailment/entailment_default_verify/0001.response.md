Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program does not correctly identify the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction for a given sum `n`. Specifically, the program checks for pairs `(i, n - i)` where the GCD of `i` and `n - i` is 1, but it does not ensure that the fraction `i / (n - i)` is in its simplest form and is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction. For instance, when `n = 14`, the program outputs `(6, 8)` because the GCD of 6 and 8 is 2, and it does not simplify the fraction to its irreducible form, which would be `(3, 4)`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, making the original assessment correct.
