Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Requirements**: 
   - The program needs to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) such that \(a + b = n\).
   - A fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is proper if \(a < b\).
   - A fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is irreducible if \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates through all possible values of \(a\) from 0 to \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\). This ensures that \(a < b\) because \(b = n - a\).
   - For each value of \(a\), it checks if the fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is irreducible by verifying if \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1\).
   - If the condition is met, it prints the pair \((a, b)\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no valid pairs \((a, b)\) are found, the program simply ends without printing anything. This correctly handles the scenario where no proper irreducible fractions meet the criteria.

4. **Example Outputs**:
   - For \(n = 3\), the only possible pair is \((1, 2)\), and \(\text{gcd}(1, 2) = 1\). Thus, the output is `1 2`.
   - For \(n = 4\), the only possible pair is \((1, 3)\), and \(\text{gcd}(1, 3) = 1\). Thus, the output is `1 3`.
   - For \(n = 12\), the maximum proper irreducible fraction is \((5, 7)\), and \(\text{gcd}(5, 7) = 1\). Thus, the output is `5 7`.

Since the program iterates through all possible values, checks for the irreducibility condition, and outputs the valid pair if found, it correctly implements the problem description for all valid inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct.
