Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the greatest common divisor (gcd) check fails to find a pair that satisfies the conditions for a proper irreducible fraction. Specifically, for the input `n = 12`, the program should output `5 7` because it is the largest possible proper irreducible fraction where the sum of the numerator and denominator is 12. However, the current implementation may miss this pair due to the loop structure. The loop runs until `i` reaches `n / 2`, which is `6` in this case, and the gcd check may not find `5` and `7` as a valid pair because the loop condition checks up to `n / 2 - 1`. Therefore, the program does not guarantee finding the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction for all inputs.
