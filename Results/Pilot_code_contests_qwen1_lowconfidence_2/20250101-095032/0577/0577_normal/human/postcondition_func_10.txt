The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string, which always includes the '0b' prefix. After removing the '0b' prefix, the function returns the resulting binary string. This covers all possible inputs where `n` is a non-negative integer, including edge cases such as `n = 0`, which would return the string '0'. The function does not handle negative integers; attempting to pass a negative integer will result in a TypeError, as the `bin()` function only works with non-negative integers.
