The function `func_17` opens 'input.txt' for reading and 'output.txt' for writing, but it does not perform any operations on the content of these files. It sets the standard input to read from 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to 'output.txt'. This means that any subsequent input or output operations in the program will be directed to these files instead of the console. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not return any value.
