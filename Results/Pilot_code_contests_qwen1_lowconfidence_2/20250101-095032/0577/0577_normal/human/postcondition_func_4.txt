The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list from the undefined function `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. There are no defined actions or postconditions that can be summarized due to the lack of implementation for `func_3()`. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_5` concludes is that it returns an unspecified list from `func_3()`, with no additional information about the list's contents or any modifications made to it.
