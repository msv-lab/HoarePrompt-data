None of the variables in the function signature are present in the provided function. The function `func_3()` does not take any parameters and its purpose seems unrelated to the problem description. It reads input from the standard input, splits it based on spaces, and converts the split strings to integers using `map`, but it does not contribute to solving the given problem.
