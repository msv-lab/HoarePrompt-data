The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` represented as a string and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the string representation of `n`. It converts each character in the string `n` to an integer and collects these integers into a list. This process works correctly for any valid string representation of a positive integer, including edge cases such as single-digit numbers (e.g., "5" would return `[5]`) and leading zeros (e.g., "00123" would return `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3]`). There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and it handles all provided annotations accurately.
