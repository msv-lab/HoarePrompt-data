Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to remove the substrings "AB" and "BB" from the input string until no more such substrings are found. The function `solve` checks if the string contains "AB" or "BB", and if so, it removes all occurrences of these substrings. The final length of the string is returned, which correctly represents the shortest string that can be obtained.

The function `func_18` handles the input and calls `solve` for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description. The output is printed using `func_19`, which writes the results to the standard output as specified.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and examples provided. It correctly processes strings containing "AB" and "BB", and accounts for strings that do not contain these substrings by returning their original lengths.
