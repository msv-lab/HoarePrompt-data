You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters 'A' and 'B'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "AB" or "BB". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.

For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations: AABABBA → AABBA → AAA.

Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each of the next t lines contains a single test case each, consisting of a non-empty string s: the string that Zookeeper needs to bomb. It is guaranteed that all symbols of s are either 'A' or 'B'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| (length of s) among all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the length of the shortest string that Zookeeper can make.

Example

Input


3
AAA
BABA
AABBBABBBB


Output


3
2
0

Note

For the first test case, you can't make any moves, so the answer is 3.

For the second test case, one optimal sequence of moves is BABA → BA. So, the answer is 2.

For the third test case, one optimal sequence of moves is AABBBABBBB → AABBBABB → AABBBB → ABBB → AB → (empty string). So, the answer is 0.

    func_18()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user via input(). The program prompts the user to enter an integer, which is then converted to an integer type and returned. No error handling is included for cases where the user might input non-integer values, potentially leading to a runtime error.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns the user's input. The function prompts the user to enter some input and then returns this input to the caller. There are no edge cases mentioned in the provided code, and the code does exactly what the annotation suggests. However, it should be noted that the function relies on the `input()` function, which may throw a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception if the user interrupts the program before providing input. In such a case, the program would terminate abruptly without returning any value.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters accepted by the function. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in the `map` object containing fewer elements than expected or potentially raising a `ValueError`. However, the function does not handle these edge cases, so it is the responsibility of the caller to manage them.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from standard input, which should be a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B' separated by spaces. It then splits the string into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string (although the elements are already strings), and returns a map object containing these strings 'A' or 'B'. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing no spaces, in which case the map object will contain a single element. The function does not handle invalid inputs or non-string characters other than 'A' and 'B'.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list from the undefined function `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. There are no defined actions or postconditions that can be summarized due to the lack of implementation for `func_3()`. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_5` concludes is that it returns an unspecified list from `func_3()`, with no additional information about the list's contents or any modifications made to it.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` ensures that the recursion limit and stack size are set to sufficiently high values before starting another function called `main`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. After executing, the program will have a recursion limit of 1,000,000 and a stack size of 1,024,000 bytes, and the `main` function will be running in a separate thread. If the recursion limit or stack size is insufficient for the `main` function to execute, the program will still proceed with these settings. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that the settings will be appropriate for most use cases of the `main` function.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is a tuple or list containing at least two elements, where the second element is a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The function returns the second element of `item`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest. After the function concludes, the program will have returned a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B' that is the second element of the input `item`.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of strings, where each string consists of the characters 'A' and 'B' only. It returns a new list of strings from `l` sorted in descending order based on a custom key 'getKey'. The function does not modify the original list `l`. If the list `l` is empty, it returns an empty list. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the 2D list to be created, and `num` is the integer value that will fill every cell in the 2D list. The function returns a 2D list with dimensions `n` by `m`, where every cell contains the integer value `num`. This is achieved through a nested list comprehension, which creates the desired 2D list structure and initializes all elements with the given integer `num`. The function handles the case where both `n` and `m` are positive integers, as specified, and will correctly generate the 2D list with the appropriate dimensions and filled values. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise returns `False`. This is achieved through the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`, which simplifies to checking if `x` is 0. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code; it correctly implements the intended behavior.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string, which always includes the '0b' prefix. After removing the '0b' prefix, the function returns the resulting binary string. This covers all possible inputs where `n` is a non-negative integer, including edge cases such as `n = 0`, which would return the string '0'. The function does not handle negative integers; attempting to pass a negative integer will result in a TypeError, as the `bin()` function only works with non-negative integers.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` represented as a string and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the string representation of `n`. It converts each character in the string `n` to an integer and collects these integers into a list. This process works correctly for any valid string representation of a positive integer, including edge cases such as single-digit numbers (e.g., "5" would return `[5]`) and leading zeros (e.g., "00123" would return `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3]`). There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and it handles all provided annotations accurately.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`, where `x` is an integer and `y` is a positive integer (y > 0). After executing, the function returns either `x // y` if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), or `x // y + 1` if there is a remainder when `x` is divided by `y` (i.e., `x % y != 0`). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases as described in the provided annotations.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where both `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer representing the modulus. The function calculates `res` using modular exponentiation, specifically `res = x^y % p`. This is achieved through a loop where `x` is squared and reduced modulo `p` in each iteration, and `res` is updated to `res * x % p` whenever `y` is odd. After the loop, the function returns `res`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` holds the result of `x^y % p`, `x` is set to its final value after the loop (which is equivalent to `x^(y%phi(p)) % p` due to properties of modular exponentiation, where `phi(p)` is Euler's totient function for `p`), `y` is 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The function handles edge cases such as when `y` is 0, in which case `res` will be 1 since `x^0 % p = 1`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the algorithm, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` as `x`, and sets `y` to 0. This process handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly returning the non-zero value as the GCD and setting the other to 0.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If these conditions are met, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or 3, which are handled correctly by the initial checks. The function also handles larger numbers by checking divisibility only up to the square root of `n`, ensuring efficiency.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` opens 'input.txt' for reading and 'output.txt' for writing, but it does not perform any operations on the content of these files. It sets the standard input to read from 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to 'output.txt'. This means that any subsequent input or output operations in the program will be directed to these files instead of the console. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not return any value.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = raw_input()

        func_19(solve(s))
''' 

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18` repeatedly takes an integer input from the user, reads a string `s` consisting of characters 'A' and 'B', and passes `s` to `func_19` through a call to `solve(s)`. After the loop completes, the function does not return any value but invokes `func_19` multiple times with the results of `solve(s)`. If no further input is given, the function will not invoke `func_19` at all. The exact state of the variables within `solve` and `func_19` remains unknown after the function concludes. An edge case to consider is when the input string `s` is empty or contains characters other than 'A' and 'B', although the initial annotation specifies `s` is a non-empty string consisting of these characters.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def solve(s):
    if s.find('AB') == -1 and s.find('BB') == -1:
        return len(s)
    while s.find('AB') != -1:
        s = s.replace('AB', '')
    while s.find('BB') != -1:
        s = s.replace('BB', '')
    return len(s)
''' 

 Output hints for function19:  The function `solve` accepts a string `s` consisting of only the characters 'A' and 'B'. It first checks if the string contains neither "AB" nor "BB". If this condition is met, it returns the length of the string. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of "AB" and then removes all occurrences of "BB" from the string. After these operations, it returns the length of the resulting string. The final state of the program is that the returned value is either the length of the modified string or 0 if the string becomes empty after removing "BB".
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function20:  The function `func_19` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the positional arguments to the standard output (`sys.stdout`), separated by the value of `kwargs.get('sep', ' ')`. After printing, it appends the value of `kwargs.get('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.get('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the standard output buffer. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function executes is that the standard output contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the standard output buffer is flushed; otherwise, it remains unchanged.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
