You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters 'A' and 'B'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "AB" or "BB". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.

For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations: AABABBA → AABBA → AAA.

Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each of the next t lines contains a single test case each, consisting of a non-empty string s: the string that Zookeeper needs to bomb. It is guaranteed that all symbols of s are either 'A' or 'B'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| (length of s) among all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the length of the shortest string that Zookeeper can make.

Example

Input


3
AAA
BABA
AABBBABBBB


Output


3
2
0

Note

For the first test case, you can't make any moves, so the answer is 3.

For the second test case, one optimal sequence of moves is BABA → BA. So, the answer is 2.

For the third test case, one optimal sequence of moves is AABBBABBBB → AABBBABB → AABBBB → ABBB → AB → (empty string). So, the answer is 0.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the string contains only 'B's. Specifically, the program uses `s.replace('AB', '')` and `s.replace('BB', '')` to remove occurrences of "AB" and "BB" from the string. However, the program does not account for the scenario where there are only "BB" sequences, which would lead to an infinite loop if the string consists solely of 'B's.

For example, consider the input string "BBBB". The program will keep replacing "BB" with nothing (`''`), leading to an endless loop without reducing the string length:

```
BBBB → BB → B → ''
```

However, the correct result for "BBBB" should be 0 because all "BB" sequences can be removed. The program fails to handle this case correctly, making it incorrect according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables used in the function signature are present in the provided code snippet. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and is responsible for returning an integer value representing the number of test cases.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user via input()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user via input(). The program prompts the user to enter an integer, which is then converted to an integer type and returned. No error handling is included for cases where the user might input non-integer values, potentially leading to a runtime error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables used in the function signature are present in the provided code snippet. The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and seems to be a placeholder or a part of a larger solution that is not shown here.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the user's input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns the user's input. The function prompts the user to enter some input and then returns this input to the caller. There are no edge cases mentioned in the provided code, and the code does exactly what the annotation suggests. However, it should be noted that the function relies on the `input()` function, which may throw a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception if the user interrupts the program before providing input. In such a case, the program would terminate abruptly without returning any value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are present in the provided function. The function `func_3()` does not take any parameters and its purpose seems unrelated to the problem description. It reads input from the standard input, splits it based on spaces, and converts the split strings to integers using `map`, but it does not contribute to solving the given problem.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from input split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters accepted by the function. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in the `map` object containing fewer elements than expected or potentially raising a `ValueError`. However, the function does not handle these edge cases, so it is the responsibility of the caller to manage them.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, which is a single line containing a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing strings 'A' or 'B' based on the input string split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from standard input, which should be a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B' separated by spaces. It then splits the string into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string (although the elements are already strings), and returns a map object containing these strings 'A' or 'B'. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing no spaces, in which case the map object will contain a single element. The function does not handle invalid inputs or non-string characters other than 'A' and 'B'.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided in the given program. The function `func_5` does not take any parameters and it returns a list from another function `func_3()` which is not defined in the provided code snippet.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list from the function `func_3()`, but the exact content of the list is unknown as `func_3()` is not defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list from the undefined function `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. There are no defined actions or postconditions that can be summarized due to the lack of implementation for `func_3()`. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_5` concludes is that it returns an unspecified list from `func_3()`, with no additional information about the list's contents or any modifications made to it.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and it seems to be a utility function to ensure sufficient recursion limit and stack size for another function (main) to run. No variables related to the problem description are present in the function signature.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` ensures that the recursion limit and stack size are set to sufficiently high values before starting another function called `main`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. After executing, the program will have a recursion limit of 1,000,000 and a stack size of 1,024,000 bytes, and the `main` function will be running in a separate thread. If the recursion limit or stack size is insufficient for the `main` function to execute, the program will still proceed with these settings. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that the settings will be appropriate for most use cases of the `main` function.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or a list containing at least two elements, where the second element is a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B' that is the second element of the tuple or list 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is a tuple or list containing at least two elements, where the second element is a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The function returns the second element of `item`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest. After the function concludes, the program will have returned a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B' that is the second element of the input `item`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of strings, where each string consists of the characters 'A' and 'B' only.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of strings from 'l' sorted in descending order based on the custom key 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of strings, where each string consists of the characters 'A' and 'B' only. It returns a new list of strings from `l` sorted in descending order based on a custom key 'getKey'. The function does not modify the original list `l`. If the list `l` is empty, it returns an empty list. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the 2D list to be created, and num is the integer value that will fill every cell in the 2D list.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #`The program returns a 2D list with dimensions n by m, where every cell contains the integer value num`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the 2D list to be created, and `num` is the integer value that will fill every cell in the 2D list. The function returns a 2D list with dimensions `n` by `m`, where every cell contains the integer value `num`. This is achieved through a nested list comprehension, which creates the desired 2D list structure and initializes all elements with the given integer `num`. The function handles the case where both `n` and `m` are positive integers, as specified, and will correctly generate the 2D list with the appropriate dimensions and filled values. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns True if x is 0, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise returns `False`. This is achieved through the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`, which simplifies to checking if `x` is 0. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code; it correctly implements the intended behavior.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and n >= 0.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary string representation of integer n without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string, which always includes the '0b' prefix. After removing the '0b' prefix, the function returns the resulting binary string. This covers all possible inputs where `n` is a non-negative integer, including edge cases such as `n = 0`, which would return the string '0'. The function does not handle negative integers; attempting to pass a negative integer will result in a TypeError, as the `bin()` function only works with non-negative integers.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer represented as a string.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the string representation of `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` represented as a string and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the string representation of `n`. It converts each character in the string `n` to an integer and collects these integers into a list. This process works correctly for any valid string representation of a positive integer, including edge cases such as single-digit numbers (e.g., "5" would return `[5]`) and leading zeros (e.g., "00123" would return `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3]`). There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and it handles all provided annotations accurately.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer, and y is a positive integer (y > 0).
def func_13(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns x divided by y using integer division
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer value of `x // y + 1`, where `x % y != 0`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`, where `x` is an integer and `y` is a positive integer (y > 0). After executing, the function returns either `x // y` if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), or `x // y + 1` if there is a remainder when `x` is divided by `y` (i.e., `x % y != 0`). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases as described in the provided annotations.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and p is a positive integer representing the modulus.
def func_14(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is \(\left((x \% p) \times (x \% p)\right) \times \left((x \% p) \times (x \% p)\right) \times \cdots \times \left((x \% p) \times (x \% p)\right) \% p\) (where the expression is repeated `k` times, with `k` being the number of times `y` was greater than 0), `y` is 0, `res` is the result of repeatedly updating `res` to `res * x % p` whenever `y` is odd, `p` remains unchanged.
    return res
    #The program returns `res` which is the result of repeatedly updating `res` to `res * x % p` whenever `y` is odd, and `x` is \(\left((x \% p) \times (x \% p)\right) \times \left((x \% p) \times (x \% p)\right) \times \cdots \times \left((x \% p) \times (x \% p)\right) \% p\) (where the expression is repeated `k` times, with `k` being the number of times `y` was greater than 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where both `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer representing the modulus. The function calculates `res` using modular exponentiation, specifically `res = x^y % p`. This is achieved through a loop where `x` is squared and reduced modulo `p` in each iteration, and `res` is updated to `res * x % p` whenever `y` is odd. After the loop, the function returns `res`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` holds the result of `x^y % p`, `x` is set to its final value after the loop (which is equivalent to `x^(y%phi(p)) % p` due to properties of modular exponentiation, where `phi(p)` is Euler's totient function for `p`), `y` is 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The function handles edge cases such as when `y` is 0, in which case `res` will be 1 since `x^0 % p = 1`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_15(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the algorithm, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` as `x`, and sets `y` to 0. This process handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly returning the non-zero value as the GCD and setting the other to 0.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_16(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than or equal to 4
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer greater than 1 and greater than or equal to 4, and n is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:

        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and greater than or equal to 4, and not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, and `n` must be at least 25, and `n` is not divisible by any integer `i` or `i + 2` where `i` is any integer from 5 onwards, and the final value of `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If these conditions are met, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or 3, which are handled correctly by the initial checks. The function also handles larger numbers by checking divisibility only up to the square root of `n`, ensuring efficiency.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no input or output processing done within the function `func_17`. The function sets up file streams for reading from 'input.txt' and writing to 'output.txt', but it does not define any variables or process any strings related to the problem described.
def func_17():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` opens 'input.txt' for reading and 'output.txt' for writing, but it does not perform any operations on the content of these files. It sets the standard input to read from 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to 'output.txt'. This means that any subsequent input or output operations in the program will be directed to these files instead of the console. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not return any value.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'A' and 'B' only.
def func_18():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = raw_input()
        
        func_19(solve(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is an integer input from the user, `solve(s)` has been computed and passed to `func_19` multiple times (or not at all if no further iterations occur), the exact values of the variables inside `solve` and `func_19` are unknown.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` repeatedly takes an integer input from the user, reads a string `s` consisting of characters 'A' and 'B', and passes `s` to `func_19` through a call to `solve(s)`. After the loop completes, the function does not return any value but invokes `func_19` multiple times with the results of `solve(s)`. If no further input is given, the function will not invoke `func_19` at all. The exact state of the variables within `solve` and `func_19` remains unknown after the function concludes. An edge case to consider is when the input string `s` is empty or contains characters other than 'A' and 'B', although the initial annotation specifies `s` is a non-empty string consisting of these characters.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of only the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def solve(s):
    if (s.find('AB') == -1 and s.find('BB') == -1) :
        return len(s)
        #The program returns the length of the string `s` which consists of only the characters 'A' and 'B', does not contain the substring "AB", and does not contain the substring "BB"
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a non-empty string consisting of only the characters 'A' and 'B', and either 'AB' or 'BB' is present in the string
    while s.find('AB') != -1:
        s = s.replace('AB', '')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is an empty string, the original string `s` has had all occurrences of 'AB' removed.
    while s.find('BB') != -1:
        s = s.replace('BB', '')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is an empty string or no longer contains the substring 'BB'
    return len(s)
    #The program returns the length of string 's', which is 0 since it is an empty string or no longer contains the substring 'BB'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `solve` accepts a string `s` consisting of only the characters 'A' and 'B'. It first checks if the string contains neither "AB" nor "BB". If this condition is met, it returns the length of the string. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of "AB" and then removes all occurrences of "BB" from the string. After these operations, it returns the length of the resulting string. The final state of the program is that the returned value is either the length of the modified string or 0 if the string becomes empty after removing "BB".

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only.
def func_19():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` is an empty list or contains the elements passed to the function, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the standard output contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` is an empty list or contains the elements passed to the function, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the standard output contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. The `flush` parameter does not affect the output content but may influence the flushing of the standard output buffer if set to `True`. Since `flush` is `False` in this case, the output buffer is not explicitly flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the positional arguments to the standard output (`sys.stdout`), separated by the value of `kwargs.get('sep', ' ')`. After printing, it appends the value of `kwargs.get('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.get('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the standard output buffer. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function executes is that the standard output contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the standard output buffer is flushed; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
