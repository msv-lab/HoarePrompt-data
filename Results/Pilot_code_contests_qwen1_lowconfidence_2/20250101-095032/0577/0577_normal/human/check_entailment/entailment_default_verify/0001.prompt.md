You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters 'A' and 'B'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "AB" or "BB". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.

For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations: AABABBA → AABBA → AAA.

Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each of the next t lines contains a single test case each, consisting of a non-empty string s: the string that Zookeeper needs to bomb. It is guaranteed that all symbols of s are either 'A' or 'B'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| (length of s) among all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the length of the shortest string that Zookeeper can make.

Example

Input


3
AAA
BABA
AABBBABBBB


Output


3
2
0

Note

For the first test case, you can't make any moves, so the answer is 3.

For the second test case, one optimal sequence of moves is BABA → BA. So, the answer is 2.

For the third test case, one optimal sequence of moves is AABBBABBBB → AABBBABB → AABBBB → ABBB → AB → (empty string). So, the answer is 0.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `solve(s)` checks if the string contains the substrings "AB" or "BB". If it finds these substrings, it removes them until no more can be found, and then returns the length of the resulting string. 

Let's verify the solution with a few test cases:

1. For the input "AAA":
   - No "AB" or "BB" substrings are present, so the result is the original string length: 3.
   
2. For the input "BABA":
   - The first replacement: "BABA" → "BA".
   - Resulting string length: 2.
   
3. For the input "AABBBABBBB":
   - First replacement: "AABBBABBBB" → "AABBBABB".
   - Second replacement: "AABBBABB" → "AABB".
   - Third replacement: "AABB" → "AB".
   - Final replacement: "AB" → "".
   - Resulting string length: 0.

The program handles all given examples and potential edge cases correctly. There is no case found where the program does not meet the requirements as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 20 : The function `func_19` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the positional arguments to the standard output (`sys.stdout`), separated by the value of `kwargs.get('sep', ' ')`. After printing, it appends the value of `kwargs.get('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.get('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the standard output buffer. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program after the function executes is that the standard output contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the standard output buffer is flushed; otherwise, it remains unchanged.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
