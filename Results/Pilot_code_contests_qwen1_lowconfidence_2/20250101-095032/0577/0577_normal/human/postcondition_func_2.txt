The function `func_3()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters accepted by the function. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in the `map` object containing fewer elements than expected or potentially raising a `ValueError`. However, the function does not handle these edge cases, so it is the responsibility of the caller to manage them.
