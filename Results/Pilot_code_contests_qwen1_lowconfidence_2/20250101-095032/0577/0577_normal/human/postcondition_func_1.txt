The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns the user's input. The function prompts the user to enter some input and then returns this input to the caller. There are no edge cases mentioned in the provided code, and the code does exactly what the annotation suggests. However, it should be noted that the function relies on the `input()` function, which may throw a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception if the user interrupts the program before providing input. In such a case, the program would terminate abruptly without returning any value.
