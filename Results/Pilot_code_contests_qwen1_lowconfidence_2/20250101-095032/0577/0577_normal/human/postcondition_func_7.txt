The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of strings, where each string consists of the characters 'A' and 'B' only. It returns a new list of strings from `l` sorted in descending order based on a custom key 'getKey'. The function does not modify the original list `l`. If the list `l` is empty, it returns an empty list. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling.
