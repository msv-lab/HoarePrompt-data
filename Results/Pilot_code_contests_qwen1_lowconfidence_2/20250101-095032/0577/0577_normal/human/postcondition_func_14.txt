The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the algorithm, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` as `x`, and sets `y` to 0. This process handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly returning the non-zero value as the GCD and setting the other to 0.
