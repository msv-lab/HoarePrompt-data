The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If these conditions are met, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or 3, which are handled correctly by the initial checks. The function also handles larger numbers by checking divisibility only up to the square root of `n`, ensuring efficiency.
