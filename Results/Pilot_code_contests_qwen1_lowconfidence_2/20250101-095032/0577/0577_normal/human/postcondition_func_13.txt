The function `func_14` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where both `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer representing the modulus. The function calculates `res` using modular exponentiation, specifically `res = x^y % p`. This is achieved through a loop where `x` is squared and reduced modulo `p` in each iteration, and `res` is updated to `res * x % p` whenever `y` is odd. After the loop, the function returns `res`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `res` holds the result of `x^y % p`, `x` is set to its final value after the loop (which is equivalent to `x^(y%phi(p)) % p` due to properties of modular exponentiation, where `phi(p)` is Euler's totient function for `p`), `y` is 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The function handles edge cases such as when `y` is 0, in which case `res` will be 1 since `x^0 % p = 1`.
