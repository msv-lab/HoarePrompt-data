The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from standard input, which should be a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B' separated by spaces. It then splits the string into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string (although the elements are already strings), and returns a map object containing these strings 'A' or 'B'. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing no spaces, in which case the map object will contain a single element. The function does not handle invalid inputs or non-string characters other than 'A' and 'B'.
