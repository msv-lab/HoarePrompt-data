The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the 2D list to be created, and `num` is the integer value that will fill every cell in the 2D list. The function returns a 2D list with dimensions `n` by `m`, where every cell contains the integer value `num`. This is achieved through a nested list comprehension, which creates the desired 2D list structure and initializes all elements with the given integer `num`. The function handles the case where both `n` and `m` are positive integers, as specified, and will correctly generate the 2D list with the appropriate dimensions and filled values. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.
