The function `func_13` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`, where `x` is an integer and `y` is a positive integer (y > 0). After executing, the function returns either `x // y` if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), or `x // y + 1` if there is a remainder when `x` is divided by `y` (i.e., `x % y != 0`). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases as described in the provided annotations.
