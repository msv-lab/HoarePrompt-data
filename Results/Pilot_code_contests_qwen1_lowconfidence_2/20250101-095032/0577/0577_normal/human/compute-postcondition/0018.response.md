The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect the other variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**
