Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` is an empty list or contains the elements passed to the function, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the standard output contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. The `flush` parameter does not affect the output content but may influence the flushing of the standard output buffer if set to `True`. Since `flush` is `False` in this case, the output buffer is not explicitly flushed.***
