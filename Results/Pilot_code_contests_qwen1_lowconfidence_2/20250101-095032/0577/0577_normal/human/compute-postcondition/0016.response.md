Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the standard output contains the string representation of `sep` appended to the existing content. Since there is no else part, this condition holds unconditionally if the if condition `not at_start` is true.***
