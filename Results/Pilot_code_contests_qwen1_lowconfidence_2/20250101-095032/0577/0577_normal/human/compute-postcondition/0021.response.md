Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` is an empty list or contains the elements passed to the function, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, the standard output contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. The current value of `flush` is `False` as it was popped from `kwargs`.**
