The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `args`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and the standard output content) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the standard output content remains as `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`, and the value of `at_start` is now `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` (default `sys.stdout`) or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and standard output contains `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`.**
