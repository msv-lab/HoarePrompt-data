`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Since `sep` is either `' '` or `kwargs['sep']`, and `kwargs['sep']` defaults to `' '`, `sep` is `' '`. The standard output initially contains `sep` followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`. After executing the code, the standard output will now include the additional space written by `file.write(sep)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` must contain at least two elements, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` (default `sys.stdout`) or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, and standard output contains two spaces followed by the string representation of the first element in `args`.**
