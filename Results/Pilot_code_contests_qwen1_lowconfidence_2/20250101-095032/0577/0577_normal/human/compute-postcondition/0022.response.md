The code `file.flush()` is called, which flushes the internal buffer of the file object, making sure that all pending writes are completed. However, the actual content written to the standard output (`sys.stdout`) does not change as a result of this operation. The variables `s`, `args`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `flush` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, `args` is an empty list or contains the elements passed to the function, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` (default `' ')` or `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `flush` is `False`, and the standard output contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.**
