The function `func_6` ensures that the recursion limit and stack size are set to sufficiently high values before starting another function called `main`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. After executing, the program will have a recursion limit of 1,000,000 and a stack size of 1,024,000 bytes, and the `main` function will be running in a separate thread. If the recursion limit or stack size is insufficient for the `main` function to execute, the program will still proceed with these settings. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that the settings will be appropriate for most use cases of the `main` function.
