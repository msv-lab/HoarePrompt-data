The provided function `func_19` is not directly related to solving the given problem. It seems to be a utility function for printing values to a stream. Therefore, we do not need to consider its variables in the precondition description for the problem.

Since the function `func_19` does not contribute to solving the problem, we will focus on the main function that should be written to solve the given problem. However, based on the problem description and the expected input/output, we can infer the required preconditions for the main function.

Here's the precondition for the main function that would solve the given problem:

```python
def shortest_string_after_bombing(s: str) -> int:
    # Function to calculate the length of the shortest string after bombing
    pass

Precondition: **s is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only.**
```

This precondition ensures that the input string `s` meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.
