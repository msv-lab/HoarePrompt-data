The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a pixel picture where each element is either `"."` (white) or `"#"` (black), along with two integers `n` and `m` indicating the dimensions of the matrix. The function iterates over each column of the matrix to count the number of white (`"."`) and black (`"#"` or any character other than `"."`) pixels. It then returns two lists: `black_cost`, which contains the count of white pixels for each column, and `white_cost`, which contains the count of black pixels for each column. The function covers all columns from `0` to `m-1`. If the matrix is empty or `n` is `0`, the function will still iterate over the columns and return empty lists for both `black_cost` and `white_cost`.
