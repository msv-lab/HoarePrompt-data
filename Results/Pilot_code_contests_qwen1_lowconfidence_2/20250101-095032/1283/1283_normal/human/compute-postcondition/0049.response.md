The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will immediately proceed to the next line of code outside this block. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions \((y+1) \times m\) and \((y+1) \times m\) respectively, initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` must be less than `x`, `c2` is `float('inf')`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cb` is equal to `b`, `i` is equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
