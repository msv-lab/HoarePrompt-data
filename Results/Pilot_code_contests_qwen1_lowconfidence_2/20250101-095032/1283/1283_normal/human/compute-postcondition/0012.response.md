The code initializes the variable `c1` to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This assignment does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `c1`.

Output State: **`c1` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions (y+1) x m and (y+1) x m respectively, initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column.**
