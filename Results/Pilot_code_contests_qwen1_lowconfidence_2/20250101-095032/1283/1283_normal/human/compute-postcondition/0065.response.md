The code `c2 += black_cost[i]` increments the value of `c2` by `black_cost[i]`. Given that `c2` was initially `float('inf')`, adding any non-negative value to it (since `black_cost[i]` represents costs which are non-negative) will make `c2` equal to `black_cost[i]`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`c1` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` must be greater than or equal to `x - 3`, `c2` is `black_cost[i]`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cb` is `b + 2`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
