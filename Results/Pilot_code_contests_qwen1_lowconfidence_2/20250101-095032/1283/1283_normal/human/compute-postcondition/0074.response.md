Postcondition: ***`c1` remains `float('inf')`, `c2` is updated as `black_cost[i]` from the start to the last iteration plus the result of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)`, `c3` is updated as `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `w` is the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `x` and `y` are positive integers, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers, `index` is an integer, `i` is an integer, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***

This postcondition includes all the variables and their updated states as per the given if condition, while retaining the conditions from the precondition.
