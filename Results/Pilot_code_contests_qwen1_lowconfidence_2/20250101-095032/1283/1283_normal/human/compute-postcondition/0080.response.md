The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions `(y+1) x m` and `(y+1) x m` respectively, both initialized to -1.
- `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines.
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa.
- `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed.
- `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column.
- `b` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column.

The function returns:
- Case_1: `0`
- Case_2: `0`
- Case_3: `infinity (`float('inf')`)`
- Case_4: The minimum of `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`
- Case_5: The minimum value among `c1, c2, c3, and c4`, where `c2` and `c3` are updated based on the conditions involving `black_cost`, `white_cost`, and indices, and `c4` is similarly updated but considering `black_cost` instead of `white_cost`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept various parameters related to a pixel picture and specific costs, and return different values based on the given cases.
