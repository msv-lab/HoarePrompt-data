The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions \((y+1) \times m\) and \((y+1) \times m\) respectively, initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` must be less than `x`, `c2` is `float('inf') + black_cost[m]`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cb` is equal to `b`, `i` is equal to the original value of `i` plus 1, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
