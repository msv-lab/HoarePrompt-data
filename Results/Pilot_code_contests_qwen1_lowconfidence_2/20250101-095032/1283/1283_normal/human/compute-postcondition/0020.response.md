Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state to determine what adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while cw < x:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial State:
- `c1` is 0
- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions \((y+1) \times m\) and \((y+1) \times m\) respectively, initialized to -1
- `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture
- `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa
- `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed
- `w` and `cw` are equal integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column
- `b` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column
- `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all `float('inf')`
- `i = index`

### Analysis:
The loop condition is `cw < x`. To make the loop execute at least once, we need to ensure that `cw` is less than `x` when the loop starts.

Given:
- `cw` represents the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column.
- `index` is the current column being processed, and it is equal to `i`.

To ensure that `cw < x` initially, we need to set `cw` to a value less than `x` when the loop begins.

### Adjusted State:
Since `cw` is initialized to a value that might be equal to `x` or greater, we need to adjust `cw` to be less than `x` for the loop to execute.

**State:**
`c1` is 0, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions \((y+1) \times m\) and \((y+1) \times m\) respectively, initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all `float('inf')`, and `cw` must be less than `x`.
