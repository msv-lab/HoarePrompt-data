`c1` is incremented by the value returned by the function `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cw` is `x` or greater, `c1` is the sum of `white_cost` for all columns from `index` to `i-1` plus the number of such columns plus the return value of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions \((y+1) \times m\) and \((y+1) \times m\) respectively, initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all `float('inf')`, and `i` is the last column processed.**
