Postcondition: ***`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are integers, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `x` and `y` are positive integers, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers, `index` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `cb` is an integer, `i` is an integer, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the current width `w` of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column is between `x` and `y` inclusive, then `c1` remains `float('inf')`, `c2` is updated as `black_cost[i]` from the start to the last iteration plus the result of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)`, `c3` is updated as `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`, and other variables retain their respective updated states. Otherwise, `c1` is the sum of `white_cost` for all columns from `index` to `i-1` plus the number of such columns plus the return value of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is updated as mentioned, and other variables retain their respective updated states.***
