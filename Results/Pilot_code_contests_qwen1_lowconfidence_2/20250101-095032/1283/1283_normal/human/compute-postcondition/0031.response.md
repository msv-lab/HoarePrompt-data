`i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1` is `white_cost[i] + 1 + white_cost[i]`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers with dimensions \((y+1) \times m\) and \((y+1) \times m\) respectively, initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all `float('inf')`, and `cw` must be equal to `x - 1`.
