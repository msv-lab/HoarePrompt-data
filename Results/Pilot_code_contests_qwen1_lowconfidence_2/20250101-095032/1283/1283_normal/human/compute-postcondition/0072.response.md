The code updates `c3` with the value of `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`. This means that `c3` now holds this new value. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the current width `w` of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column is between `x` and `y` inclusive still holds.

Output State: **`c1` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` is equal to the final value of `cb` which is `b + k`, `c2` is the accumulated cost `black_cost[i]` from the start to the last iteration plus the result of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)`, `c3` is `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cb` is `b + k + 1`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus the number of iterations, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current width `w` of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column is between `x` and `y` inclusive.**
