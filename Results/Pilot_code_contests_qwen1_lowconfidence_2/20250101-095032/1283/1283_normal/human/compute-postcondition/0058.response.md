The code `c2 += black_cost[i]` updates the value of `c2` by adding the value of `black_cost[i]` to its current value. Since `c2` was initially `float('inf')`, it will now become `black_cost[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it the original value of `i` plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c1` is `float('inf')`, `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists of integers initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of strings representing the pixel picture, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the picture, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing the minimum and maximum allowed width of monochrome vertical lines, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and vice versa, `index` is an integer representing the current column being processed, `w` is an integer representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line ending at the current column, `b` must be less than `x - 1`, `c2` is `black_cost[i]`, `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`, `cb` is `b + 1`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
