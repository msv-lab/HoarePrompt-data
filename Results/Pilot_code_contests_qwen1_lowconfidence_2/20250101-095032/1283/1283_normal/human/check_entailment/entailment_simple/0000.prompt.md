You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Note

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .#.#.  
    .#.#.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
