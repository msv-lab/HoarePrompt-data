Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of pixel changes to achieve the barcode pattern. Specifically, the recursive function `func_2` does not properly handle the constraints for the width of monochrome vertical lines (x and y). The function allows the possibility of splitting a group of consecutive columns into smaller segments, which violates the requirement that each group's size must be between x and y.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 4 2 3
#.##
.###
####
```

The expected output is 3, as changing only three pixels (`#` to `.`) can achieve the desired barcode pattern:

```
..##
.###
####
```

However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the way it splits groups and calculates costs, potentially leading to more changes than necessary. This suggests that the program does not fully meet the problem description requirements.
