You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows:

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a pixel picture where each element is either `"."` (white) or `"#"` (black), along with two integers `n` and `m` indicating the dimensions of the matrix. The function iterates over each column of the matrix to count the number of white (`"."`) and black (`"#"` or any character other than `"."`) pixels. It then returns two lists: `black_cost`, which contains the count of white pixels for each column, and `white_cost`, which contains the count of black pixels for each column. The function covers all columns from `0` to `m-1`. If the matrix is empty or `n` is `0`, the function will still iterate over the columns and return empty lists for both `black_cost` and `white_cost`.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` processes a pixel picture represented by a 2D list `matrix`, with dimensions `n x m`, to determine the minimum cost of converting monochrome vertical lines within specified width ranges `[x, y]` to achieve certain configurations. It uses dynamic programming tables `dp1` and `dp2` to store intermediate results. The function considers three possible operations at each column: extending the existing monochrome vertical line, creating a new line, or changing the color of pixels to match the required monochrome line configuration.

The function returns one of the following based on the state of the program:
- `0`: If the current width of the monochrome vertical line is zero and meets the condition `w >= x` or `b >= x`.
- `float('inf')`: If the current width of the monochrome vertical line is outside the allowed range `[x, y]` and no valid configuration can be formed.
- The minimum of `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`: If precomputed values from the DP tables are available.
- The minimum value among `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`: If the function recursively computes the costs for extending or creating new monochrome vertical lines, adjusting for the current column and width constraints, and considering the costs of changing pixel colors to match the required configuration.

Potential edge cases include:
- When the current column `index` exceeds the picture width `m`.
- When the width of the monochrome vertical line is exactly `x` but needs to extend further to reach `y`.
- When the current width of the monochrome vertical line is outside the allowed range `[x, y]`.

Missing functionality includes:
- Proper handling of the case when `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]` are not available, where the function should compute the costs recursively to fill these values.
- Ensuring the correct termination conditions for the recursive calls to `func_2` to avoid infinite loops or incorrect results.
- Handling the case where `index` reaches the end of the picture but the current width `w` or `b` is still within the allowed range `[x, y]`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
