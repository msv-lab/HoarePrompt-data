Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code has several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description for every potential case:

1. **Handling of DP Tables Initialization**: The code initializes the DP tables `dp1` and `dp2` with `-1`, but it does not properly initialize them to handle the base cases where the width of the monochrome vertical line is exactly `x` or within the range `[x, y]`. This leads to incorrect computation of the minimum number of pixels to repaint.

2. **Recursive Calls and Base Cases**: The recursive calls in `func_2` do not properly handle the base cases where the current column index `index` exceeds the picture width `m`. The function should return `float('inf')` in such cases to indicate that no valid configuration can be formed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the case where the current width of the monochrome vertical line is exactly `x` but needs to extend further to reach `y`. This can lead to incorrect computation of the minimum number of pixels to repaint.

4. **Proper Termination Conditions**: The code lacks proper termination conditions for the recursive calls, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.

Here is an example that highlights one of these issues:

Consider the input:
```
4 5 1 2
.####
###..
##.##
#..#.
```

The expected output is `8`, but the code will not handle this case correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

To fix these issues, the code needs to properly initialize the DP tables, handle base cases correctly, and ensure proper termination conditions for recursive calls.
