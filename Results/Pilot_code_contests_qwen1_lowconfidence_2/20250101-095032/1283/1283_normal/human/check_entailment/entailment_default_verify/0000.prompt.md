You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Note

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .#.#.  
    .#.#.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of pixel changes to achieve the barcode pattern. Specifically, the recursive function `func_2` does not properly handle the constraints for the width of monochrome vertical lines (x and y). The function allows the possibility of splitting a group of consecutive columns into smaller segments, which violates the requirement that each group's size must be between x and y.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 4 2 3
#.##
.###
####
```

The expected output is 3, as changing only three pixels (`#` to `.`) can achieve the desired barcode pattern:

```
..##
.###
####
```

However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the way it splits groups and calculates costs, potentially leading to more changes than necessary. This suggests that the program does not fully meet the problem description requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a pixel picture represented by a 2D list `matrix`, with dimensions `n x m`, to determine the minimum cost of converting monochrome vertical lines within specified width ranges `[x, y]` to achieve certain configurations. It uses dynamic programming tables `dp1` and `dp2` to store intermediate results. The function considers three possible operations at each column: extending the existing monochrome vertical line, creating a new line, or changing the color of pixels to match the required monochrome line configuration.

The function returns one of the following based on the state of the program:
- `0`: If the current width of the monochrome vertical line is zero and meets the condition `w >= x` or `b >= x`.
- `float('inf')`: If the current width of the monochrome vertical line is outside the allowed range `[x, y]` and no valid configuration can be formed.
- The minimum of `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`: If precomputed values from the DP tables are available.
- The minimum value among `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`: If the function recursively computes the costs for extending or creating new monochrome vertical lines, adjusting for the current column and width constraints, and considering the costs of changing pixel colors to match the required configuration.

Potential edge cases include:
- When the current column `index` exceeds the picture width `m`.
- When the width of the monochrome vertical line is exactly `x` but needs to extend further to reach `y`.
- When the current width of the monochrome vertical line is outside the allowed range `[x, y]`.

Missing functionality includes:
- Proper handling of the case when `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]` are not available, where the function should compute the costs recursively to fill these values.
- Ensuring the correct termination conditions for the recursive calls to `func_2` to avoid infinite loops or incorrect results.
- Handling the case where `index` reaches the end of the picture but the current width `w` or `b` is still within the allowed range `[x, y]`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
