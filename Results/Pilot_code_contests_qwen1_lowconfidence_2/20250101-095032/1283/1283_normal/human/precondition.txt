matrix is a 2D list of strings where each string consists of "." and "#", representing white and black pixels respectively. n and m are positive integers such that 0 < n, m ≤ 1000, and the length of each string in matrix is equal to m. Additionally, x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000.
