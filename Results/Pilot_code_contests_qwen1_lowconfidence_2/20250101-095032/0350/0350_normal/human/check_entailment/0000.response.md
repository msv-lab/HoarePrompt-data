Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Input Reading Issue**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3. Instead, it should use `input()`. This alone would cause a syntax error in Python 3 environments.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Negative and Positive Subsegments**:
   - The program attempts to count subsegments based on the cumulative product sign using the arrays `p` and `q`.
   - However, the logic for updating `p` and `q` is flawed. For instance, if the current element is positive, the logic updates `p[i]` and `q[i]` incorrectly. Specifically, it should update `p[i]` with `p[i - 1] + 1` only if the previous segment was positive, and similarly for `q[i]`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p, q = 0, 0
    pos_count, neg_count = 0, 0
    
    for num in A:
        if num > 0:
            p += 1
            neg_count += p
        else:
            q += 1
            pos_count += q

    print(f"{neg_count} {pos_count}")

func()
```

This corrected version properly counts the number of positive and negative subsegments by maintaining running counts of positive and negative segments.
