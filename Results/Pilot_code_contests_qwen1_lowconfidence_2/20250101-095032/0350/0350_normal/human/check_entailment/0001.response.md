Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sequence contains only negative numbers. In the provided example input `(-1 -2 -3 -4 -5)`, the program outputs `9 6` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `9 6` for negative products and `0` for positive products since all subsegments will have a negative product. The program incorrectly counts some subsegments as having a positive product due to the way it handles the transition from negative to positive counts.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that when transitioning from negative to positive products, it correctly resets the counts or properly handles the accumulation of negative and positive products.
