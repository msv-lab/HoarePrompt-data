Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of subsegments with negative and positive products. Specifically, the logic for updating the `p` and `q` arrays is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions for `p[0]` and `q[0]` are correctly set based on whether `A[0] > 0` or `A[0] <= 0`. However, this is only for the very first element.

2. **Logic for Updating `p` and `q`**:
   - If `A[i] > 0`, then `p[i]` should be updated as `p[i - 1] + 1` because the product is positive, and `q[i]` should be updated as `q[i - 1]` because adding a positive number does not change the count of negative products.
   - If `A[i] <= 0`, then `p[i]` should be updated as `q[i - 1]` because a negative or zero product can flip the sign, and `q[i]` should be updated as `p[i - 1] + 1` because adding a negative or zero number can introduce a new positive product.

The current implementation incorrectly updates both `p` and `q` based on the sign of `A[i]`, which leads to incorrect counts of subsegments with positive and negative products. For instance, consider the input `[5, -3, 3, -1, 1]`. The correct counts should be 8 for negative products and 7 for positive products, but the code does not achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    p = [0] * n
    q = [0] * n
    
    if A[0] > 0:
        p[0] = 1
    else:
        q[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
    
    print(sum(q), sum(p))
```

This corrected version properly handles the logic for updating `p` and `q` based on the sign of each element in the array.
