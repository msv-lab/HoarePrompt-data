Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of subsegments with negative and positive products. Specifically, the logic for updating the `p` and `q` arrays is incorrect. Here’s why:

1. The code initializes `p` and `q` based on the sign of the first element but does not correctly update these values as it iterates through the array. For instance, if the array starts with a negative number, `p[0]` should be 0 and `q[0]` should be 1, but the code sets them incorrectly.
2. The logic inside the for loop does not properly update `p` and `q` based on the sign of the current element. If `A[i] > 0`, it should increment `p` and keep `q` unchanged, but the code incorrectly updates both `p` and `q`.
3. The final output calculation sums up `q` and `p`, which are not correctly computed.

To fix this, the logic needs to correctly handle the transition between positive and negative products. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    pos_count = 0
    neg_count = 0
    sign = 1 if A[0] > 0 else -1
    
    for num in A:
        if num > 0:
            pos_count += 1
            if sign == -1:
                neg_count += pos_count
        else:
            neg_count += 1
            if sign == 1:
                pos_count += neg_count
        sign *= -1
    
    print(neg_count, pos_count)

func()
```

This corrected version properly counts the number of subsegments with negative and positive products by maintaining the correct count of positive and negative subsegments as it iterates through the array.
