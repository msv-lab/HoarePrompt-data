You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import collections
import bisect
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), representing the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and a_i ≠ 0.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    idx, size = 0, len(A)
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if (A[0] > 0) :
        p[0], q[0] = 1, 0
    else :
        q[0], p[0] = 1, 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is `len(A)`; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being 1 or 0 and all others being 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being 0 or 1 and the rest being 0; the first element of `A` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: **`i` is `size`, `size` is a positive integer, `idx` is `size - 1`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` and `q` lists are updated such that for every index `j` from `1` to `size - 1`:
    #- If `A[j] > 0`, then `p[j] = p[j - 1] + 1` and `q[j] = q[j - 1]`.
    #- If `A[j] <= 0`, then `p[j] = q[j - 1]` and `q[j] = p[j - 1] + 1`.
    #
    #The first element of `A` remains unchanged and is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. The lists `p` and `q` are initialized such that `p[0]` is 1 or 0 and all other elements of `p` are 0, while `q[0]` is 0 or 1 and all other elements of `q` are 0. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `size` is 1), then `p` and `q` are `[1]` and `[0]`, respectively, and the first element of `A` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
