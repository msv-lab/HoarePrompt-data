`q[i]` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 3, `p[3]` is `q[2]`, and since `i` is 3, `p[3 - 1]` is `p[2]`, which is equal to `q[2]`. Therefore, `q[3]` is assigned the value of `q[2] + 1`.

Since the initial state is `p[3]` is `q[2]`, we can update this relationship to reflect the new value of `q[3]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `size` must be greater than 3, `idx` is 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p[3]` is `q[2] + 1`, `q[3]` is `q[2] + 1**
