`q[i]` is assigned the value of `q[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `q[i - 1]` refers to `q[1]`. The value of `q[1]` is unchanged from the initial state, which means `q[1]` retains its original value. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `size` must be at least 2; `idx` is 1; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p[2]` is `prev_p1 + 1`; `q[2]` is equal to `q[1]`; `q` remains unchanged.**
