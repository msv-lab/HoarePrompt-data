The code `q[i] = q[i - 1]` assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `q[i]`. Since `i` is 3, this means `q[3]` is assigned the value of `q[2]`.

The initial state does not provide the value of `q[2]`, so let's denote it as `value_of_q2`. After executing the code, `q[3]` will be updated to `value_of_q2`.

The other variables (`i`, `size`, `idx`, `total`, `p[3]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `size` must be greater than 3, `idx` is 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p[3]` is `p[2] + 1`, `q[3]` is `value_of_q2`**
