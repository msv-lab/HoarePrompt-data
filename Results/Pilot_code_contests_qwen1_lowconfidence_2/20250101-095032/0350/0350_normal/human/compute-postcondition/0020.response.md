Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `size` must be at least 2, `idx` is 0, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` and `q` lists are updated as follows: if `A[i]` is greater than 0, then `p` is `[1, 2] + [0] * (size - 2)` and `q` is `[0, 0] + [0] * (size - 1)`. If `A[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then `p` is `[1, 0] + [0] * (size - 2)` and `q` is `[0, 2] + [0] * (size - 2)`. The first element of `A` remains unchanged and is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.***
