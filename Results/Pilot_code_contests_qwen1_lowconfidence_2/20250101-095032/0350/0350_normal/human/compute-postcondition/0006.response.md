The code initializes a list `p` with `size` number of elements, all set to 0. The value of `size` is the length of the map object `A`. The other variables (`n`, `A`, `idx`, `total`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is len(A); `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2; `p` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0.**
