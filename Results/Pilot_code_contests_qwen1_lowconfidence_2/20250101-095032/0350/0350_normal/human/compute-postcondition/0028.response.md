The code `p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1` assigns the value of `p[i - 1] + 1` to `p[i]`. However, the initial state does not include the definition of `p`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `p[i]`. But we know that `i` is 3, so `p[3]` will be updated to `p[2] + 1`. The values of `i`, `size`, `idx`, and `total` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `size` must be greater than 3, `idx` is 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p[3]` is `p[2] + 1`**
