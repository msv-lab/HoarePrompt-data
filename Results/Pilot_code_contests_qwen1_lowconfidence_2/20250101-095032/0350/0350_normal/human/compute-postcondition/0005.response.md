The code calculates the sum of the first `size` natural numbers using the formula `size * (1 + size) / 2`. Here, `size` is the length of the map object `A`. The value of `total` is calculated but does not affect other variables. The variables `n`, `A`, `idx`, and `size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is len(A); `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2**
