The given code prints the sum of the elements in list `q` and the sum of the elements in list `p`. Since the values of `q` and `p` are determined by the condition inside the loop and the initial values provided, the code execution will simply print these sums without changing the values of `q` and `p` or any other variables.

Given the initial conditions and the fact that no further operations are performed on `q` and `p` within the code snippet provided, the values of `q` and `p` remain as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output will be the sum of the elements in `q` and `p` as per their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `size`, `size` is a positive integer, `idx` is `size - 1`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` and `q` are as defined in the initial state, and the output of the print statement is the sum of the elements in `q` and `p`.**
