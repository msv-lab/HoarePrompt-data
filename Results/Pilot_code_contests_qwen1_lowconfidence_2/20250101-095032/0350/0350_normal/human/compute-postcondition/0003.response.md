`A` is assigned the value of `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `A` is a map object that contains the integers split from the input string. The input is expected to be a series of space-separated integers, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `n` retains its initial value as the integer input by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input**
