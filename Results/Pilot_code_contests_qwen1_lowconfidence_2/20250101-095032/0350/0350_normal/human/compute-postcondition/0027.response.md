Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `size` must be at least 2
   - `idx` is 1
   - `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(1, size)`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < size`.
   - Since `size` must be at least 2, and we are incrementing `i` to 3, the condition `i < size` will only hold if `size` is greater than 3.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` should be 3.
   - `size` must be greater than 3.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - `idx` will be updated to `i`, so `idx` will be 3.
   - `total` remains the same since it does not change with each iteration of the loop.
   - The values of `p` and `q` are dependent on the value of `A[2]` and may change, but we don't have specific details on these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `size` must be greater than 3, `idx` is 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`**.
