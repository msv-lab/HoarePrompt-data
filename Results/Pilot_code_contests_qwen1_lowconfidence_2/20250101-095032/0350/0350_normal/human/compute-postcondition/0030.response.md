The code assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `p[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `p[3]` is assigned the value of `q[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the assignment to `p[3]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `size` must be greater than 3, `idx` is 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p[3]` is `q[2]`**
