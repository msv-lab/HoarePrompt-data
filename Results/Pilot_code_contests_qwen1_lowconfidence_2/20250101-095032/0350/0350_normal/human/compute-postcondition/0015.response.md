`p[i]` is assigned the value `p[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `p[i - 1]` refers to `p[0]`. From the initial state, `p` is defined as `[1] + [0] * (size - 1)`, which means `p[0]` is 1. Therefore, `p[1]` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2.

The output state after executing this line of code is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `size` must be at least 2, `idx` is 0, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is `[1, 2] + [0] * (size - 2)`, `q` is `[0] + [0] * (size - 1)`, the first element of `A` is greater than 0, `A[i]` is greater than 0**
