The code assigns the value of `p[i - 1] + 1` to `q[i]`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `size` must be at least 2
- `idx` is 1
- `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`
- `p[2]` is `q[1]`

For `i = 2`, the expression `p[i - 1] + 1` becomes `p[1] + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `p[1]`, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `p[1]` must exist.

Therefore, `q[2]` is assigned the value of `p[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `size` must be at least 2; `idx` is 1; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p[2]` is `q[1]`; `q[2]` is `p[1] + 1`**
