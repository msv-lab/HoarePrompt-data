The code snippet changes the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not affect the values of `n` or the list of integers `a`. The `sys.stdin.readline` reference is used for taking inputs, but no actual input processing is done here. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), representing the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and a_i ≠ 0. The recursion limit is set to 10 ** 6.**
