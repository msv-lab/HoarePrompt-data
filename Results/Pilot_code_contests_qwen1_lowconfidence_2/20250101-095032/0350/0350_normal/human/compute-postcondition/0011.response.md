`q[0]` is assigned the value `1`, and `p[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is len(`A`); `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2; `p` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements, where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0; `A[0]` is less than or equal to 0**
