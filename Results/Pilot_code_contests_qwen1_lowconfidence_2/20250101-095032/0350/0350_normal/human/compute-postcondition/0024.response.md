The code snippet assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `p[i]`. Given the initial state, let's determine the impact on the variables:

- `i` is 2.
- `size` must be at least 2, but its exact value is not needed for this calculation.
- `idx` is 1.
- `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`.
- `p` and `q` are updated accordingly based on the value of `A[2]`, but their exact values before and after the assignment are not provided.

Since `i` is 2, `p[i]` becomes `p[2]` and `q[i - 1]` becomes `q[2 - 1]`, which is `q[1]`.

Therefore, the value of `p[2]` is assigned the value of `q[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `size` must be at least 2; `idx` is 1; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p[2]` is `q[1]`.**
