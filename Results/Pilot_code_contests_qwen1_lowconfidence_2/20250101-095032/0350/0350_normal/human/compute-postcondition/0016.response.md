The code `q[i] = q[i - 1]` assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `q[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `q[1]` is assigned the value of `q[0]`. From the initial state, `q[0]` is 0.

Therefore, `q[1]` becomes 0, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `size` must be at least 2, `idx` is 0, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is `[1, 2] + [0] * (size - 2)`, `q` is `[0, 0] + [0] * (size - 1)`, the first element of `A` is greater than 0, `A[i]` is greater than 0**
