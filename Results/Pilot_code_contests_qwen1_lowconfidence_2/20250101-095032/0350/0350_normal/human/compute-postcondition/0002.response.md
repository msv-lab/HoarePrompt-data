The code reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the variable `n` now holds the value of the integer input by the user. The other parts of the initial state, such as the input sequence of integers, are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, the sequence of integers from the second line of input remains unchanged**
