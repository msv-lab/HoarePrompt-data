The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` does not actually execute the input reading process but rather changes the reference of the `input` variable to point to `sys.stdin.readline`. This means that when the input is eventually read using `input()`, it will now refer to `sys.stdin.readline` instead of the default input function.

Since no actual input is read in this snippet, the only change is the reference of the `input` variable. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), representing the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and a_i ≠ 0. The reference of the `input` variable is now `sys.stdin.readline`.**
