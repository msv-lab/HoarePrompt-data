The function `func` accepts a sequence of integers through two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), representing the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each `a_i` satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and `a_i` ≠ 0.

Based on the provided information, the function does not return a specific value but processes the sequence of integers. However, since the problem statement only provides the input format and no explicit output, we can only describe the input without specifying the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a sequence, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and `a_i` ≠ 0.**
