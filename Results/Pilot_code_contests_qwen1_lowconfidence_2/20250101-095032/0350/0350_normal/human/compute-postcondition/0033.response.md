Output State: **`i` is `size`, `size` is a positive integer, `idx` is `size - 1`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` and `q` lists are updated such that for every index `j` from `1` to `size - 1`:
- If `A[j] > 0`, then `p[j] = p[j - 1] + 1` and `q[j] = q[j - 1]`.
- If `A[j] <= 0`, then `p[j] = q[j - 1]` and `q[j] = p[j - 1] + 1`.

The first element of `A` remains unchanged and is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. The lists `p` and `q` are initialized such that `p[0]` is 1 or 0 and all other elements of `p` are 0, while `q[0]` is 0 or 1 and all other elements of `q` are 0. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `size` is 1), then `p` and `q` are `[1]` and `[0]`, respectively, and the first element of `A` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
