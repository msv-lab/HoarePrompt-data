The code assigns the value of 0 to `idx` and the length of the map object `A` to `size`. The initial state of `n` (an integer input by the user) and the map object `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is len(A)**
