Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `size` must be at least 2, `idx` is 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`. Depending on the value of `A[2]`, `p[2]` can either be `prev_p1 + 1` and `q[2]` is `q[1]`, or `p[2]` is `q[1]` and `q[2]` is `p[1] + 1`. The variable `q` may be updated accordingly in both cases.***
