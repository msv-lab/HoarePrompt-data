You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}), representing the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and a_i ≠ 0.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    idx, size = 0, len(A)
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if (A[0] > 0) :
        p[0], q[0] = 1, 0
    else :
        q[0], p[0] = 1, 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is `len(A)`; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being 1 or 0 and all others being 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being 0 or 1 and the rest being 0; the first element of `A` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: **`i` is `size`, `size` is a positive integer, `idx` is `size - 1`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` and `q` lists are updated such that for every index `j` from `1` to `size - 1`:
    #- If `A[j] > 0`, then `p[j] = p[j - 1] + 1` and `q[j] = q[j - 1]`.
    #- If `A[j] <= 0`, then `p[j] = q[j - 1]` and `q[j] = p[j - 1] + 1`.
    #
    #The first element of `A` remains unchanged and is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. The lists `p` and `q` are initialized such that `p[0]` is 1 or 0 and all other elements of `p` are 0, while `q[0]` is 0 or 1 and all other elements of `q` are 0. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `size` is 1), then `p` and `q` are `[1]` and `[0]`, respectively, and the first element of `A` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a sequence, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and `a_i` ≠ 0.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
