The code initializes a new list `q` with `size` elements, all set to 0. The value of `size` is determined by `len(A)`, which is the length of the map object `A`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is len(A); `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2; `p` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is len(A); `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2; `p` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0.**
