`p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `p[i - 1]` is `p[1]`. However, the value of `p[1]` is not provided in the initial state. Since no specific value for `p[1]` is given, let's denote the previous value of `p[1]` as `prev_p1`.

After executing the code, `p[2]` will be `prev_p1 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `size` must be at least 2; `idx` is 1; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p[2]` is `prev_p1 + 1`; `q` remains unchanged**
