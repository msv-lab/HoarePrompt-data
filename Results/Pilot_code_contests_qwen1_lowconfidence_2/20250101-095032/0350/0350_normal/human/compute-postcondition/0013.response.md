Let's break down the given information and determine what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input.
- `idx` is currently 0.
- `size` is `len(A)`.
- `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`.
- `p` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being 1 or 0 and all others being 0.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being 0 or 1 and the rest being 0.
- The first element of `A` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.

### For Loop:
```
for i in xrange(1, size):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `size` is `len(A)`, which means `size` is the number of elements in the map `A`.
   - `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`.
   - `p` is initialized as `[1] + [0] * (size - 1)`.
   - `q` is initialized as `[0] + [0] * (size - 1)`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for i in xrange(1, size):` starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i < size`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 1 up to (but not including) `size`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `size - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.
   - The variable `size` remains unchanged during the loop execution.

### Adjusted States:
- We need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and can go up to `size - 1`. 
- `size` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute (since the loop starts from 1 and ends just before `size`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `size` must be at least 2, `idx` is 0, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is `[1] + [0] * (size - 1)`, `q` is `[0] + [0] * (size - 1)`, the first element of `A` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0**
