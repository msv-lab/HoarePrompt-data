`p[0]` is assigned the value `1`, and `q[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated values are: `n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is `len(A)`; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being `1` and all others being `0`; `q` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being `0` and all others being `0`; the first element of `A` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `A` is a map object containing the integers from the input; `idx` is 0; `size` is `len(A)`; `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`; `p` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being `1` and all others being `0`; `q` is a list of `size` elements, with the first element being `0` and all others being `0`; the first element of `A` is greater than 0**
