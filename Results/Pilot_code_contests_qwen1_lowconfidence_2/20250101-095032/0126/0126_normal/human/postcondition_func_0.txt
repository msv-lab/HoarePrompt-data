The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `w`, which are positive integers between 1 and 300 inclusive. It prints an `h x w` grid where each cell contains either a `#` or a `.`, depending on the parity of the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j`. Specifically, cells where `i + j` is even contain `#`, and those where `i + j` is odd contain `.`. After the function concludes, the program state includes an output consisting of `h` lines, each containing `w` characters alternating between `#` and `.`, based on the parity of `i + j`. This pattern ensures a checkerboard-like distribution of `#` and `.` characters across the grid.
