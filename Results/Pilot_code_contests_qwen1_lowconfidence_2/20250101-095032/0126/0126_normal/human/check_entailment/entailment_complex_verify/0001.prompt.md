You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Draw a chessboard which has a height of H cm and a width of W cm. For example, the following figure shows a chessboard which has a height of 6 cm and a width of 10 cm.


.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#


Note that the top left corner should be drawn by '#'.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ H ≤ 300
* 1 ≤ W ≤ 300

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers H and W separated by a single space.

The input ends with two 0 (when both H and W are zero).

Output

For each dataset, print the chessboard made of '#' and '.'.

Print a blank line after each dataset.

Example

Program:
```
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        print('')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead of `raw_input()`. This change is necessary to ensure the program works correctly across different Python versions. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the width is odd, leading to incorrect patterns in certain scenarios.

To demonstrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
5 7
0 0
```

Expected output for a 5x7 chessboard:
```
#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#
```

However, due to the incorrect usage of `raw_input()` and potential issues with handling odd-width boards, the program may produce incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: h and w are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 300 and 1 <= w <= 300.
def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        
        print('')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, and the output consists of `h` lines where each line alternates between `#` and `.` based on the parity of `i + j`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `w`, which are positive integers between 1 and 300 inclusive. It prints an `h x w` grid where each cell contains either a `#` or a `.`, depending on the parity of the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j`. Specifically, cells where `i + j` is even contain `#`, and those where `i + j` is odd contain `.`. After the function concludes, the program state includes an output consisting of `h` lines, each containing `w` characters alternating between `#` and `.`, based on the parity of `i + j`. This pattern ensures a checkerboard-like distribution of `#` and `.` characters across the grid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
