Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` indeed aims to print a chessboard pattern where the top-left corner is `#` and the pattern alternates correctly. However, the original assessment noted that the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` was incorrect for generating the desired pattern. The annotation provided in the annotated version describes the current logic, which incorrectly places `#` and `.` based on the sum of the row and column indices. This does not match the required pattern described in the problem statement. The correct logic should check if the row index `i` is even, as stated in the corrected version provided earlier. Since the current implementation does not generate the correct pattern, the original assessment remains accurate.
