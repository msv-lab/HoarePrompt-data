Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a nested loop to iterate over each cell of the chessboard and prints `#` if the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` otherwise. This ensures the correct checkerboard pattern is generated for any valid height `H` and width `W` within the given constraints. The program also handles the termination condition correctly by breaking the loop when both `H` and `W` are zero. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the specified constraints.
