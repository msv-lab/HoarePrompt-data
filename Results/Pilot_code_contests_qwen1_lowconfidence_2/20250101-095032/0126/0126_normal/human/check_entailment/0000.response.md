Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the chessboard pattern. Specifically, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is incorrect for generating the desired pattern. According to the problem description, the top-left corner should be `#`, but the given condition will place `#` and `.` in an alternating pattern based on the sum of the row and column indices, which does not match the required pattern.

A correct approach would be to check if the row index `i` is even, and then the first column should always be `#`, followed by alternating `#` and `.`. Here is a corrected version:

```python
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if i % 2 == 0 else '.', end='')
        print('')
    print('')
```

This corrected version ensures that the top-left corner is `#` and generates the correct alternating pattern for the entire chessboard.
