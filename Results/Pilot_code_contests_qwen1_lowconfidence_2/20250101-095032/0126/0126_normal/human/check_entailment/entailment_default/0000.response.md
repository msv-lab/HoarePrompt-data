Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through a grid of size `h x w` and prints `#` for cells where the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` for cells where the sum is odd. This results in a checkerboard pattern as required.

The code handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ H ≤ 300 and 1 ≤ W ≤ 300). The output hints confirm that the function generates the correct checkerboard pattern based on the parity of the sum of indices, which matches the requirement to draw a chessboard.

Since the code correctly produces the desired output for every potential case within the specified constraints, the program is correct.
