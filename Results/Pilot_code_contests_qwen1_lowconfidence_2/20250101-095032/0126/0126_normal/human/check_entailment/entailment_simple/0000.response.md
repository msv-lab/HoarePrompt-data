Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses a `while` loop to continuously read input until both `H` and `W` are `0`. This correctly handles multiple datasets as specified.

2. **Function Call**: After reading `H` and `W`, the program calls the function `func_1(h, w)` with the values of `H` and `W`. This ensures that each dataset is processed individually.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over the rows (`i`) and columns (`j`) of the chessboard.
   - It prints `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` and `.` otherwise, ensuring the pattern alternates correctly.
   - After printing all columns in a row, it prints a newline character to start a new row.

4. **Output Format**: The program ensures that each dataset is followed by a blank line, as required by the problem description.

5. **Constraints**: The function `func_1` adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description (1 ≤ H ≤ 300 and 1 ≤ W ≤ 300).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
