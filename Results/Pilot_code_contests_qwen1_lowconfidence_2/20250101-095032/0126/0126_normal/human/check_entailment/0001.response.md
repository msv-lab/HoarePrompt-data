Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead of `raw_input()`. This change is necessary to ensure the program works correctly across different Python versions. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the width is odd, leading to incorrect patterns in certain scenarios.

To demonstrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
5 7
0 0
```

Expected output for a 5x7 chessboard:
```
#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#
```

However, due to the incorrect usage of `raw_input()` and potential issues with handling odd-width boards, the program may produce incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
