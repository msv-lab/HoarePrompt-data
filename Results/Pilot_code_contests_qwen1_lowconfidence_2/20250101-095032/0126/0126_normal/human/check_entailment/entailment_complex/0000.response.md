Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input in a loop until it encounters `0 0`. For each valid pair `(h, w)` (where `1 ≤ h, w ≤ 300`), it calls the function `func_1(h, w)`. This handles the constraints and input format as specified.

2. **Function Logic (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1(h, w)` is designed to generate a chessboard of size `h x w` where each cell contains either `#` or `.` based on the parity of the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j`.
   - The nested loops iterate over all rows (`i`) and columns (`j`), printing `#` if `i + j` is even and `.` if `i + j` is odd.
   - After completing a row, the function prints a newline character to start the next row.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output for each dataset is formatted as required, with `h` lines of alternating `#` and `.` characters, ensuring the correct checkerboard pattern.

4. **Blank Line After Each Dataset**: The program prints a blank line after processing each dataset, as specified in the problem description.

Given the above points, the program correctly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every valid input case within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
