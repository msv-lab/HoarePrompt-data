According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop condition is `j < w`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.

At the start of the current iteration, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `w`.

Given that `j` starts at 0, the loop will execute the first time because `0 < w` (since `w` is a positive integer). For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 1 or more, but it will still be less than `w` as long as `w` is greater than 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is 1 and the condition for the loop to continue (`j < w`) is still satisfied. Since `w` is greater than 0 and `j` must be incremented to 1 for the next iteration, `w` must still be greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**.
