The code `print('')` simply prints an empty line. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w-1`, and the output consists of `w` lines where each line alternates between `#` and `.` based on the parity of `i + j`.**
