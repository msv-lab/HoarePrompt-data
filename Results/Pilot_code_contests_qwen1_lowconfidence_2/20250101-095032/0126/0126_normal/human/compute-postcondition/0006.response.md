`i` is 0 and `j` is 2, so `(i + j)` equals 2. Since 2 is even, `(i + j) % 2` equals 0, which means the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is true. Therefore, the print statement outputs `'#'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the output is `'#'`**
