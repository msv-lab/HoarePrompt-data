Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is undefined.
   - `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
   - `i` is `h`.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - The output will be `'#'` if `h` is even, and `'.'` if `h` is odd.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs over `j` from `0` to `w-1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` should be less than `w`.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `1` (since `j` starts at `0` and goes up to `w-1`).

Given these points, we can determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `total` remains undefined as it is not affected by the loop.
- `h` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
- `w` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
- `i` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is undefined, `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `1`**.
