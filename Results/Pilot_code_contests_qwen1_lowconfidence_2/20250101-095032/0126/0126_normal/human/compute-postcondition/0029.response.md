Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `w`, which are positive integers between 1 and 300 inclusive. It prints an `h x w` grid where each cell contains either a `#` or a `.`, depending on the parity of the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j`. Specifically, cells where `i + j` is even contain `#`, and those where `i + j` is odd contain `.`. After the function concludes, the program state includes an output consisting of `h` lines, each containing `w` characters alternating between `#` and `.`, based on the parity of `i + j`. This pattern ensures a checkerboard-like distribution of `#` and `.` characters across the grid.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `h` or `w` is 1, the output will be a single line or a single character, respectively, alternating between `#` and `.` based on the value of `h` or `w`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the grid to the standard output. The annotated comment incorrectly states that the function returns something based on the parameters, but the actual code does not perform any return operation.
