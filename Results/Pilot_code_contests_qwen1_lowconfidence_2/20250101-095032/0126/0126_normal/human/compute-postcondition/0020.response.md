The code prints a `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` and a `.` otherwise. Given the initial state, `i` is `h` and `j` is `0`. Since `h` is a positive integer and \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), we can determine the parity of `i + j` which is `h + 0 = h`. Since `h` is an integer greater than 1, it can be either odd or even.

- If `h` is odd, then `(h + 0) % 2 == 1`, so the output will be `'.'`.
- If `h` is even, then `(h + 0) % 2 == 0`, so the output will be `'#'`.

The variables `total`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `total` is undefined.
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\).
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `i` is `h`.
- `j` is `0`.

The output of the print statement depends on the value of `h`, which is odd or even, but since the exact value of `h` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact character printed, only the condition under which it will be printed.

Output State: **`total` is undefined, `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `0`, the output will be `'#'` if `h` is even, and `'.'` if `h` is odd.**
