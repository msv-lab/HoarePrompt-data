The given code snippet `print('')` prints an empty line. This does not affect the values of the variables `h`, `w`, or `i`. The output of the print statement is simply an empty line.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that an empty line has been printed.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is 0, and an empty line has been printed.**
