Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, and the output consists of `w` lines where each line alternates between '#' and '.' starting with '#' if `i + j` is even and '.' if `i + j` is odd.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables `h` and `w`:** These remain unchanged throughout the loop since the loop only modifies `i` and `j`.
- **Variable `i`:** Starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `h`.
- **Variable `j`:** Starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration of the inner loop. After all iterations of the inner loop, `j` will be equal to `w`.
- **Output:** The loop prints a pattern of '#' and '.' characters. Each line of the pattern has a length of `w`. The pattern starts with a '#' if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` and alternates between '#' and '.' thereafter. Since `i` will be `h` after all iterations of the outer loop, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` will determine the starting character for each line. For the first line (`j=0`), the condition will be `(h + 0) % 2 == 0`, and so on for subsequent lines.

Thus, the final output state reflects the completed state of all variables and the printed pattern after the loop has finished executing.
