The code checks if `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, we calculate `i + j` which equals 3. Since 3 is not divisible by 2, `(i + j) % 2` evaluates to 1, which means the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is False. Therefore, the `else` part of the conditional statement is executed, printing a dot (`.`).

The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the printed character is `.`**
