The code snippet checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is even or odd and prints either `#` or `.` based on that condition. Since the code does not assign any new values to `h` or `w`, and only prints a character without updating `i` or `j`, the output is based on the current values of `i` and `j`.

Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the sum `i + j` is 2, which is even. Therefore, the code will print `#`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the printed character is `#`.**
