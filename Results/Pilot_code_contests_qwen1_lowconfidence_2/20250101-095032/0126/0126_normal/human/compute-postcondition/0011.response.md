The code snippet prints either '#' or '.' based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

- The initial state has `h` as a positive integer between 1 and 300, `h > 1`, `w` as a positive integer between 1 and 300, `w > 0`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.
- The code calculates `(i + j)` which equals `1 + 0` resulting in `1`.
- The condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` checks if `1 % 2 == 0`. Since `1 % 2` is `1`, the condition evaluates to `False`.
- Because the condition is `False`, `.` is printed.

No variables are updated or reassigned within this code snippet. The output does not affect the values of `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; the output is '.'**
