The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `w`. Both `h` and `w` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\). Based on the input values, the function returns a specific output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `h` and `w`, where both are between 1 and 300 inclusive, and return an output based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `h` and `w`, where both are positive integers between 1 and 300 inclusive, and returns a specific output based on these parameters.**
