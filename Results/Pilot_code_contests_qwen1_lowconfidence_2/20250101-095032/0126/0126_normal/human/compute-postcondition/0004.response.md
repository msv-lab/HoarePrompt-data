The code prints `'#'` if \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\) and `'.'` otherwise. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, we can calculate \((i + j)\):

\[ i + j = 0 + 1 = 1 \]

Since 1 is odd, \((i + j) \% 2\) evaluates to 1, which means the condition \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\) is false. Therefore, the code will print `'.'`.

The values of the other variables (`h`, `w`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the output is `'.'`.**
