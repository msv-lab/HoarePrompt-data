The code `print('')` prints an empty line, but it does not affect the values of any variables. The values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, and no output has been printed.**
