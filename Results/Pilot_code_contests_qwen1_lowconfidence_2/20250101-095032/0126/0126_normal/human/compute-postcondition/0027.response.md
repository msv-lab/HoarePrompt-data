Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, and the output consists of `h` lines where each line alternates between `#` and `.` based on the parity of `i + j`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The outer loop runs `h` times, and the inner loop runs `w` times for each iteration of the outer loop.
2. **Printing Pattern**: For each pair `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `h-1` and `j` ranges from `0` to `w-1`, the program prints either `#` or `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`.
3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `h` because the outer loop runs `h` times.
   - `j` will be `w` because the inner loop runs `w` times.
4. **Output Content**:
   - Each line of output will alternate between `#` and `.` based on the value of `i + j` modulo 2.
   - The pattern starts with `#` if `i + j` is even and `. if `i + j` is odd.
5. **No Additional Output Variables**: No additional variables are modified or printed within the loop, so they retain their initial values or default values post-execution.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, the values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged, `i` becomes `h`, `j` becomes `w`, and the output is a grid of `#` and `.` characters according to the specified alternating pattern.
