State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 300, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for i in range(h):` will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until `i < h`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `h` must be greater than 0. Since it is given that `1 <= h <= 300`, we know `h` is positive and within the specified range.
3. The variable `w` is not directly involved in the loop condition, but it is mentioned as a positive integer within the same range. Therefore, `w` should also be included in the initial state.
4. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is 0.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are that `h` and `w` are positive integers within their respective ranges, and `i` is initialized to 0.
