State before the loop starts: `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, and no output has been printed.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```
for j in range(w):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute as long as `j` satisfies the condition \(0 \leq j < w\).

Given the initial states:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\).
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `i` is `h`.
- `j` is `w`.
- No output has been printed.

For the loop to execute, `j` must start from 0 and go up to \(w - 1\). Currently, `j` is set to `w`, which means it already exceeds the upper bound of the range \(0 \leq j < w\).

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is within the valid range for the loop to execute. Specifically, we need to set `j` to 0.

State: **`total` is undefined (no output has been printed), `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is 0**
