Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is 0, the output consists of `w` characters printed in each of the `h` rows, where each character is either `#` or `.` based on the condition \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\)**.

Explanation:
- The loop runs `w` times for each row `i` from 0 to `h-1`.
- For each row `i`, the loop prints `w` characters.
- The condition \((i + j) \% 2 == 0\) determines whether the character printed is `#` or `.`.
- When `i + j` is even, the character printed is `#`; when `i + j` is odd, the character printed is `.`.

Since the loop runs for each row up to `h` and each row contains `w` characters based on the given condition, the final output state reflects that the entire pattern is printed as described by the loop.
