According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop will execute as long as `w` is at least 1 because the `range(w)` function generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `w`.

Given the initial state where `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 300, `w` is a positive integer between 1 and 300, and `i` is 0, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing.

To ensure the loop can execute, `w` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 300, `w` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
