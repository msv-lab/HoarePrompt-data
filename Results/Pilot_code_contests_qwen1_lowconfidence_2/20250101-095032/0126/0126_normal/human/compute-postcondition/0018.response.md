Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\).
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\).
- `i` is `h`.
- `j` is `w`.
- No output has been printed.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(h):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `h-1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `h`. This means the loop has already completed all its iterations because the loop will stop when `i` reaches `h`.
3. **Next Iteration**: Since `i` is currently `h`, the condition `i < h` is no longer true, and therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

### Conclusion
Since the loop has already completed all its iterations, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State
The loop cannot execute one more time, so the state remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, and no output has been printed.**
