The code prints either `#` or `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Given the initial values `i` is `h` and `j` is `1`, we can determine the value of the expression `(i + j) % 2`.

Since `i` is `h` and `j` is `1`, the expression becomes `(h + 1) % 2`. 

- If `h` is even, `(h + 1) % 2` is `1`, which means the condition is `False`, and it prints `.`.
- If `h` is odd, `(h + 1) % 2` is `0`, which means the condition is `True`, and it prints `#`.

Therefore, the output will be `#` if `h` is odd and `.` if `h` is even. The values of `total`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is undefined, `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `1`, the printed character is `#` if `h` is odd and `.` if `h` is even.**
