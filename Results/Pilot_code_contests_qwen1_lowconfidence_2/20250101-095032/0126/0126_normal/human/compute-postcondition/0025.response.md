Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `w-1`, and the output consists of `w` lines where each line alternates between `#` and `.` based on the parity of `i + j`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = w-1`.
- For each `j`, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` determines whether `#` or `.` is printed.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `w-1`.
- The output pattern will alternate between `#` and `.` because the loop iterates over `w` columns, starting from `0` up to `w-1`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `w` is 0), then:
- `h` remains the same (`h > 1`).
- `w` is 0.
- `i` remains `h`.
- `j` is undefined since the loop doesn't run.
- The output is an empty sequence since there are no lines to print.
