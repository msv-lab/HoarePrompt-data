According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\)
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- The printed character is `#`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and become 2. Therefore, `j` must be less than `w` to allow another iteration.

The updated states are:
- `h` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\)
- `w` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 1
- `i` remains 1
- `j` is now 2
- The printed character is still `#`

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the printed character is `#`**
