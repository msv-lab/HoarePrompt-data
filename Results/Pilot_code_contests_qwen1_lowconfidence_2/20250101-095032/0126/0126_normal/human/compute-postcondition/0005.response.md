According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop condition is that `j` should be less than `w` for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\)
- `w` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- The output is `'.'`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`. Since `j` is currently 1, `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Additionally, the values of `h`, `i`, and the output do not change within the loop based on the given information, so they remain the same.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\), `w` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the output is `'.'`**
