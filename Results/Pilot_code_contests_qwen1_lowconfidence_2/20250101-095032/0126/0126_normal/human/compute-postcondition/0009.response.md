According to the code, the loop runs based on the variable `i` and the value of `h`. The loop condition is `i < h`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and an empty line has been printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still satisfy the condition `i < h`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- The condition `i < h` must still hold true, meaning `h` must be greater than 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is 1, and no line has been printed yet in this iteration.**
