According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), and `i` is already set to 1. Since the loop iterates over `range(w)`, `w` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

The initial state already ensures that `w` is a positive integer, but to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `w` is indeed greater than 0. Additionally, since no line has been printed yet, the value of `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\) and `w` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
