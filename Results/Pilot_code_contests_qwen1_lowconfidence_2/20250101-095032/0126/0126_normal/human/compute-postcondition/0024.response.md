The code checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is even or odd and prints `#` if it's even and `.` if it's odd. Given that `i` is equal to `h` and `j` is equal to `2`, the condition `(i + j) % 2` will determine what is printed.

- If `h` is odd, then `i` is odd, and since `j` is `2` (an even number), their sum `i + j` will be odd. Therefore, `#` will be printed.
- If `h` is even, then `i` is even, and since `j` is `2` (an even number), their sum `i + j` will be even. Therefore, `.` will be printed.

The variables `total`, `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the print statement, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`total` is undefined, `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(h > 1\), `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), `i` is `h`, `j` is `2`, and depending on whether `h` is odd or even, the output is either `#` or `.`.**
