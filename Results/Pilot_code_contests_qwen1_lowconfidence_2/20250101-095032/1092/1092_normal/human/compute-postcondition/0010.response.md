`s` is incremented by 1. The original value of `s` was 1, so the new value of `s` is 2. The values of the other variables (`l` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l` and must have at least one more character, `s` is 2.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l` and must have at least one more character, `s` is 2**
