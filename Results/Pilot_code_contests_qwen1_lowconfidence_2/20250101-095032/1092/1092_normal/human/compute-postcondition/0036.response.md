Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string containing at least one character, `s` is 1 (indicating that a character in `i` is uppercase), `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`. If a character `j` in `i` satisfies `j.isupper()`, `s` remains 1 and `m` is incremented by 1. There is no else part, so the postcondition does not change regardless of whether `j.isupper()` is false.***
