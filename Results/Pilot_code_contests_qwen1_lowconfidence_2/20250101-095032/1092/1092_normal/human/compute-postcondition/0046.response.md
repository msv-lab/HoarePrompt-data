The code `print(m)` prints the value of `m`, which is the maximum count of uppercase characters among all strings in the list `l`. The printing operation itself does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `l` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase characters among all strings in `l`.**
