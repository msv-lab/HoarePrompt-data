Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string containing at least one character, `j` is the second character in `i`, `s` is 1 more than its previous value, `m` is 1 more than its previous value. If the second character `j` is an uppercase letter, then no changes to `i` or `j` occur. Otherwise, no changes to `s` or `m` occur.***
