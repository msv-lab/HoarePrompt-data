Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l` and must have at least one more character, `s` is 2. If `j` (which is the first character of `i`) is uppercase, then `s` remains 2. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition being false.***
