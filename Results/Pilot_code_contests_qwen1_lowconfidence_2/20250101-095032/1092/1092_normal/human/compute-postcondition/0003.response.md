Let's break down the given code and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given code:
```python
for i in l:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

State before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
- `l` is a list of strings
- `m` is 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `l` using a variable `i`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. If `l` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Variables Involved**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable, which will take each value from the list `l`.
   - `l`: This is the list being iterated over. It must contain at least one string for the loop to execute.
   - `n`: While `n` is given as an integer between 1 and 200, this variable is not directly related to the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
   - `m`: This variable (`m`) is set to 0 and is not directly involved in the loop condition either.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `l` contains at least one element. If `l` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The values of `i` will start with the first element of `l` and continue until the last element of `l`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` must be a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l`**.

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `l` is not empty.
