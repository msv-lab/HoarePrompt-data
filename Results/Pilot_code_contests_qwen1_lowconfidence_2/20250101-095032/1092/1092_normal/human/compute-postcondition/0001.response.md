The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `l`. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings**
