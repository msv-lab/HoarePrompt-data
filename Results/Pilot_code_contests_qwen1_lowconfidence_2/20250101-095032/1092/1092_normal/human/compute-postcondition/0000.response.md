The code `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user. In this case, it will read the second line of input, which is a text of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters. However, since `raw_input()` does not assign the input to any variable in the given snippet, the value of the input is not stored. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200**
