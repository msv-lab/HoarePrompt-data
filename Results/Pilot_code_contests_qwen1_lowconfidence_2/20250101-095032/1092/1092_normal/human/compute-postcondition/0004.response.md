The code `s = 0` initializes the variable `s` to 0. The initial state specifies that `l` is a non-empty list of strings, and `i` is the first element of `l`. The variable `s` is now assigned the value 0, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is 0**
