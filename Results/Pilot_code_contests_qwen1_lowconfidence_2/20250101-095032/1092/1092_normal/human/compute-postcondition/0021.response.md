`s` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s` is `1 + 0 = 1`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `m`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the second element of `l` and must be a non-empty string, `s` is 1, `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, and the current value of `j` is an uppercase character.
