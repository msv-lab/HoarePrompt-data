The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list. The function processes an integer `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`, and a text input containing a sequence of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters. 

Based on the provided information, the function's behavior can be described as follows:

- The function does not directly accept any parameters but works with an integer `n` and a string of text.
- The integer `n` is constrained to be within the range of 1 to 200.
- The string is composed of single-space separated words using only small and capital Latin letters.

Since the output details are not explicitly given, the primary focus is on the input constraints and the nature of the parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as accepting an integer `n` within the specified range and a string of text, although no specific return value is mentioned in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string of text consisting of single-space separated words using only small and capital Latin letters.**
