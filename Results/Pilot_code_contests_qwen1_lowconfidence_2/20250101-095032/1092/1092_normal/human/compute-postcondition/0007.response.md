`s` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0. The value of `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase string.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase string**
