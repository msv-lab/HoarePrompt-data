Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `l` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `i` is the second element of `l` and must be a non-empty string.
   - `s` is equal to the count of uppercase characters in `i`.
   - `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `l`.
   - The current value of `i` is the second element of `l`, which means it is already determined before the loop starts.

3. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next element in the list `l`.
   - Since `i` was the second element, the next element would be the third element of `l`.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - `l` remains a non-empty list of strings.
   - `i` should now be the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string.
   - `s` should be the count of uppercase characters in the new value of `i`.
   - `m` should be the same as `s` because it is the count of uppercase characters in the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string, `s` is equal to the count of uppercase characters in `i`, `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`**.
