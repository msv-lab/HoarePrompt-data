Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the second element of `l` and must be a non-empty string, `s` is either 1 or 2, and `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`. If `j.isupper()` is true, `s` is set to 2. Otherwise, the value of `s` remains unchanged (which could be 1 or 0, but since `s` is initially 0 or 1, it stays within this range).***
