`s` is initially equal to 2 if the last character `j` of `i` was uppercase, and 1 otherwise. The code `s += 1` increments `s` by 1. Therefore, `s` will now be 3 if the last character `j` was uppercase (initially 2 + 1) and 2 otherwise (initially 1 + 1). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the second element of `l` and must be a non-empty string, `s` is 3 if the last character `j` was uppercase and 2 otherwise, and `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i` + 1 if the last character `j` was uppercase.**
