According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each character in `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `l` and must have at least one more character. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have at least two characters.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l` and must have at least one more character, `s` is 2.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` has at least one more character.
3. **End of Last Iteration**: `i` must have at least one more character to continue the loop. Since `i` is the first element of `l`, and it has at least one more character, it means `i` has at least two characters for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

- `l` remains a non-empty list of strings.
- `i` must now have at least two characters.
- `s` remains 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the first element of `l` and must have at least two characters, `s` is 2**.
