Functionality: **The function processes a string of text consisting of single-space separated words, where each word can contain both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It calculates and returns the maximum number of uppercase letters present in any of the words within the string. The function does not utilize the provided integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and instead focuses solely on the text string provided as input.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input string is empty, the function will return `0` since there are no words to analyze.
- If all words in the input string contain only lowercase letters, the function will return `0`.
- If all words contain only uppercase letters, the function will return the length of the longest word.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the input string might contain punctuation marks or special characters other than spaces. However, the problem statement specifies that the string consists only of small and capital Latin letters and spaces, so this is not a concern in this specific case.
