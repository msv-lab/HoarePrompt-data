`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so the new value of `s` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string containing at least one character, `s` is 1, `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, `j` is a character in `i` and `j.isupper()` is true.
