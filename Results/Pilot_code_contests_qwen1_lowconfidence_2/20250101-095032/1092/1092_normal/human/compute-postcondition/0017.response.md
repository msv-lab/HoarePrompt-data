Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `l` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `i` is the first element of `l`.
   - `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.
   - `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in l:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element of `l`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be set to the next element in the list `l`.
   - Since `l` is a non-empty list and `i` was the first element, the next element in the list will be the second element.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will now be the second element of `l`.
   - `s` and `m` should be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the second element of `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`**
