Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string containing at least one character. If the character `j` in `i` is uppercase, then `s` is set to 2 and `m` is incremented by 1. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged and `m` is still incremented by 1.***
