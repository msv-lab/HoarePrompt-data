To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `l` is a non-empty list of strings.
- `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string.
- `s` is equal to 0.
- `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.

### Loop Structure:
```
for j in i:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - `i` is the third element of the list `l`, and it must be a non-empty string. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is a non-empty string.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `j` in `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must contain at least one character (since an empty string would not allow the loop to iterate).

3. **Current States:**
   - `l` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string.
   - `s` is equal to 0.
   - `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- We already know that `i` must be a non-empty string, as stated in the problem. However, to explicitly ensure that the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `i` contains at least one character.

### Final State:
- Since `i` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute, we can summarize the required states as follows:

State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string containing at least one character, `s` is 0, `m` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`**
