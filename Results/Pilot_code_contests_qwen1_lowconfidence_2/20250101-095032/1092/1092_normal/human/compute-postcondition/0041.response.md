`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains as the third element of `l`, which is a non-empty string containing at least one character. The value of `j` remains as the second character in `i`. The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and the value of `l` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is the third element of `l` and must be a non-empty string containing at least one character, `j` is the second character in `i`, `s` is 1 more than its previous value, `m` is 1 more than its previous value**
