Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the volume of the text by finding the maximum number of uppercase letters in any of the words within the string. The code processes the input string, splits it into words, and iterates through each word to count the number of uppercase letters. It then updates the maximum count if the current word has more uppercase letters than previously recorded. Finally, it prints the maximum count, which is the volume of the text.

The output hints confirm that the function calculates the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or examples where the program would fail based on the given information. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
