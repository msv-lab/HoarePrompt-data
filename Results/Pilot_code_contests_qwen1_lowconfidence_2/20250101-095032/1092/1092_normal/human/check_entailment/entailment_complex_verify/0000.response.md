Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the program correctly processes the input text to calculate the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word. Despite not using the integer `n`, which represents the length of the text, the program correctly handles the text input and computes the required volume. The logic of counting uppercase letters and finding the maximum count per word is sound and matches the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
