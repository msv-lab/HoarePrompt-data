Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of the text as described in the problem statement. It iterates through each word, counts the number of uppercase letters, and keeps track of the maximum count. This logic handles all potential cases where words may contain varying numbers of uppercase letters. The program also correctly processes the input as specified, including the constraints on the length of the text. Therefore, the program works as expected for all given examples and potential cases.
