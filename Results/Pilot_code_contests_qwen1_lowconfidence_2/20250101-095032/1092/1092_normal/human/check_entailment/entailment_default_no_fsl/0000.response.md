Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through each word in the input text, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and keeps track of the maximum count. This maximum count is then printed as the volume of the text. The code handles all potential cases as described, including words with no uppercase letters, words with all uppercase letters, and words with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. The code also ignores the integer `n` provided in the input, which is not used in the calculation, but this does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem description.
