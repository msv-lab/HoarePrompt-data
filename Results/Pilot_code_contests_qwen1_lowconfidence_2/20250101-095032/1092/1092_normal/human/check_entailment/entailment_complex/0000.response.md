Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - Given a text of single-space separated words, where each word consists of small and capital Latin letters.
   - The volume of a word is the number of capital letters in that word.
   - The volume of the text is the maximum volume (maximum number of capital letters) among all words in the text.
   - The input is a length `n` followed by a text string.
   - The output is the volume of the text.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the input from the standard input but ignores the first line containing the integer `n`, which is not used in the computation. This is a minor deviation but since the problem description states we should focus solely on the text string, this omission does not affect the correctness.
   - The function then reads the entire text string and splits it into a list of words using `split()`.
   - A variable `m` is initialized to store the maximum volume found so far.
   - For each word in the list, the program counts the number of uppercase letters (`s`).
   - The maximum value between `s` and `m` is updated, ensuring `m` holds the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any word.
   - Finally, the function prints the value of `m`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles words with no uppercase letters correctly by setting `m` to 0 initially.
   - The program correctly processes multiple words and finds the maximum volume among them.
   - The program ignores the length `n` provided in the first line of input, which aligns with the problem statement that the function should focus solely on the text string.

Since the program correctly calculates the maximum number of uppercase letters in the text, it adheres to the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
