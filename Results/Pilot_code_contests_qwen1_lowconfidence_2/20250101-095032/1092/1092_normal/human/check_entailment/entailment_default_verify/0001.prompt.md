You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a text of single-space separated words, consisting of small and capital Latin letters.

Volume of the word is number of capital letters in the word. Volume of the text is maximum volume of all words in the text.

Calculate the volume of the given text.

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of the text.

The second line contains text of single-space separated words s1, s2, ..., si, consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.

Output

Print one integer number — volume of text.

Examples

Input

7
NonZERO


Output

5


Input

24
this is zero answer text


Output

0


Input

24
Harbour Space University


Output

1

Note

In the first example there is only one word, there are 5 capital letters in it.

In the second example all of the words contain 0 capital letters.
Program:
```
def func():
    raw_input()
    l = raw_input().split()
    m = 0
    for i in l:
        s = 0
        for j in i:
            if j.isupper():
                s += 1
        m = max(s, m)
    print(m)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of the text as described in the problem statement. It iterates through each word, counts the number of uppercase letters, and keeps track of the maximum count. This logic handles all potential cases where words may contain varying numbers of uppercase letters. The program also correctly processes the input as specified, including the constraints on the length of the text. Therefore, the program works as expected for all given examples and potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a string of text consisting of single-space separated words, where each word can contain both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It calculates and returns the maximum number of uppercase letters present in any of the words within the string. The function does not utilize the provided integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and instead focuses solely on the text string provided as input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
