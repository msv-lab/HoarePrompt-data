Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program correctly calculates the volume of the text as defined in the problem statement. It iterates through each word, counts the number of uppercase letters, and determines the maximum count among all words. The output hints confirm that the program processes a string of single-space separated words and calculates the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word, which aligns with the problem description. The program does not use the integer `n`, but this is not required according to the problem description, which only states that the length of the text is between 1 and 200. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
