Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the `tor` operation as described in the problem description. The program incorrectly updates the accumulator `ans` and does not properly handle the digit-wise modulo 3 subtraction required for the `tor` operation. Specifically, the expression `(3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3` does not correctly simulate the `tor` operation, which requires subtracting digits modulo 3 without carry.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should convert the numbers \(a\) and \(c\) into their ternary representations, process them digit by digit, and then convert the result back to decimal. The current implementation fails to accurately perform these steps, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.
