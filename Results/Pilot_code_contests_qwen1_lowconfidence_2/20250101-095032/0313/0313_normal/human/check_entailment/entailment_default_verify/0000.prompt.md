You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya very much likes computers. Recently he has received a new "Ternatron IV" as a gift from his mother. Unlike other modern computers, "Ternatron IV" operates with ternary and not binary logic. Petya immediately wondered how the xor operation is performed on this computer (and whether there is anything like it).

It turned out that the operation does exist (however, it is called tor) and it works like this. Suppose that we need to calculate the value of the expression a tor b. Both numbers a and b are written in the ternary notation one under the other one (b under a). If they have a different number of digits, then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the lengths are the same. Then the numbers are summed together digit by digit. The result of summing each two digits is calculated modulo 3. Note that there is no carry between digits (i. e. during this operation the digits aren't transferred). For example: 1410 tor 5010 = 01123 tor 12123 = 10213 = 3410.

Petya wrote numbers a and c on a piece of paper. Help him find such number b, that a tor b = c. If there are several such numbers, print the smallest one.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and c (0 ≤ a, c ≤ 109). Both numbers are written in decimal notation.

Output

Print the single integer b, such that a tor b = c. If there are several possible numbers b, print the smallest one. You should print the number in decimal notation.

import sys

def func():
    ans = 0
    (a, b) = [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()]
    while a > 0 and b > 0:
        ans *= 3
        ans += (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3
        a //= 3
        b //= 3
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the lengths of the ternary representations of `a` and `c` are different. Specifically, the program assumes that both `a` and `b` will always have values greater than 0 within the loop, which is not true when `a` or `c` is 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 0
```

In this case, the expected output should be `2`, because:
- Ternary representation of `3` is `10`.
- Ternary representation of `0` is `0`.

To perform the tor operation:
```
  10
+ 0
---
  10
```

The result should be `10` in ternary, which is `3` in decimal. However, the provided program will enter an infinite loop because `a` and `b` are never reduced to 0 simultaneously, leading to incorrect results.

A correct implementation should handle the case where either `a` or `c` is 0 by directly determining the result without entering the loop.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) and calculates a value based on specific arithmetic operations. It repeatedly modifies \(a\) and \(b\) by dividing them by 3 and updating an accumulator `ans` until both \(a\) and \(b\) become zero. Specifically, in each iteration, it updates `ans` by multiplying it by 3 and adding \((3 - a \% 3 + b \% 3) \% 3\). After the loop, the function prints the final value of `ans`. If either \(a\) or \(b\) becomes zero before the other, the remaining value is processed until it reaches zero as well. The function handles edge cases where \(a\) or \(b\) could be zero initially, and it correctly processes the values through multiple iterations of division by 3.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
