Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the lengths of the ternary representations of `a` and `c` are different. Specifically, the program assumes that both `a` and `b` will always have values greater than 0 within the loop, which is not true when `a` or `c` is 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 0
```

In this case, the expected output should be `2`, because:
- Ternary representation of `3` is `10`.
- Ternary representation of `0` is `0`.

To perform the tor operation:
```
  10
+ 0
---
  10
```

The result should be `10` in ternary, which is `3` in decimal. However, the provided program will enter an infinite loop because `a` and `b` are never reduced to 0 simultaneously, leading to incorrect results.

A correct implementation should handle the case where either `a` or `c` is 0 by directly determining the result without entering the loop.
