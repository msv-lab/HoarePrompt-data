Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a > 0 and b > 0`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is the result of the floor division of the original `a` by 9.
   - `b` is the result of the floor division of the original `b` by 9.
   - `ans` is updated by the expression `ans + (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`.

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0.

4. **Check the Values of `a` and `b`**:
   - Since `a` and `b` are the results of floor division by 9, they are non-negative integers. Therefore, if `a > 0` and `b > 0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop can execute again without any adjustment to `a` or `b`.
   - However, since we need to ensure that the loop executes one more time, we must confirm that both `a` and `b` are still greater than 0.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `a` is still greater than 0.
   - We need to ensure that `b` is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`a` is the result of the floor division of the original `a` by 9, `b` is the result of the floor division of the original `b` by 9, `a` must be greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 0**
