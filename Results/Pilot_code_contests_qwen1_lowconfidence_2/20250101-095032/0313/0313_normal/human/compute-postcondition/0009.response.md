`ans` is updated by adding `(3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3` to its current value. Let's break this down:

- `a % 3` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by 3.
- `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
- The expression `3 - a % 3 + b % 3` calculates a new value based on these remainders.
- The `% 3` at the end ensures the result is within the range 0 to 2.

Since `a` and `b` are the results of floor division by 3, their remainders (`a % 3` and `b % 3`) can only be 0, 1, or 2. The expression `3 - a % 3 + b % 3` will result in a value between 0 and 3. Taking this modulo 3 means the result will be a value between 0 and 2.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` must be a non-negative integer resulting from the floor division of the original `a` by 3.
- `b` is reduced to the result of `b // 3`.
- `ans` is `9k`, `9k+3`, or `9k+6`.

The exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but we know they are the result of floor division, and the expression `(3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3` will adjust `ans` accordingly.

Let's denote the change in `ans` as `delta` where `delta = (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`. The new value of `ans` will be `ans + delta`.

Output State: **`a` is the result of the floor division of the original `a` by 3, `b` is the result of the floor division of the original `b` by 3, `ans` is `ans + (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`**
