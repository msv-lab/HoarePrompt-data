`b` is assigned the value of itself floor-divided by 3. The initial value of `b` must be greater than 0, and after performing the floor division by 3, the value of `b` could be 0 if it was originally less than or equal to 3, or it would be reduced accordingly if it was greater than 3. The states of `a` and `ans` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` must be a non-negative integer resulting from the floor division of the original `a` by 3, `b` is reduced to the result of `b // 3`, `ans` is `3k`, `3k+1`, or `3k+2`**
