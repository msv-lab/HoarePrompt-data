The code `ans *= 3` multiplies the current value of `ans` by 3. Given the initial state where `ans` is `3k`, `3k+1`, or `3k+2`, the new value of `ans` will be `3 * (3k)`, `3 * (3k+1)`, or `3 * (3k+2)` respectively.

Let's break it down:
- If `ans` was `3k`, then `ans` becomes `3 * (3k) = 9k`.
- If `ans` was `3k+1`, then `ans` becomes `3 * (3k+1) = 9k + 3`.
- If `ans` was `3k+2`, then `ans` becomes `3 * (3k+2) = 9k + 6`.

The other variables `a`, `b`, and the loop condition `a > 0 and b > 0` remain unchanged since the code only affects `ans`.

Output State: **`a` must be a non-negative integer resulting from the floor division of the original `a` by 3, `b` is reduced to the result of `b // 3`, `ans` is `9k`, `9k+3`, or `9k+6`, and for the loop to execute one more time, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0.**
