The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. This does not change the values of the pre-existing variables `a` and `c`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0.**
