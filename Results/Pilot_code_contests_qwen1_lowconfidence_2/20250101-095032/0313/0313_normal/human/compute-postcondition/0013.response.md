`ans` is multiplied by 3. However, the initial value of `ans` is not provided. Since the initial value is not specified, the only thing we can conclude is that `ans` is now three times its initial value. The preconditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the result of the floor division of the original `a` by 9, `b` is the result of the floor division of the original `b` by 9, `a` must be greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 0; `ans` is three times its initial value**
