According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions `a > 0 and b > 0`. Right before the loop, `a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is 0, and `ans` is 0. For the loop to execute, both `a` and `b` must be greater than 0.

Since `a` is `a_input` and `b` is `b_input`, both of these variables need to be greater than 0 for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure both `a` and `b` are greater than 0.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 0**
