The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial values of `a` and `c` are given, and `ans` is initialized to 0, the output state will include these variables with their updated values based on the input.

Let's denote the input integers as `a_input` and `b_input`.

Output State: **`a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is 0, `ans` is 0**
