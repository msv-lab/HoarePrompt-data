The initial state indicates that `a` must be greater than 0 and `b` must be greater than 0. The code snippet multiplies `ans` by 3, but the initial value of `ans` is not specified. Since the value of `ans` is not given, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation, but we know it has been multiplied by 3.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `ans` is `ans * 3`**
