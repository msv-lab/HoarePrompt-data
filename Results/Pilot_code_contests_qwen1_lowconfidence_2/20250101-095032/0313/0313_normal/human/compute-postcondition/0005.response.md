The code `a //= 3` divides the value of `a` by 3 and assigns the floor division result back to `a`. The values of `b` and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` must be greater than 0
- `b` must be greater than 0
- `ans` is `3k`, `3k+1`, or `3k+2`

After executing `a //= 3`, the value of `a` is updated to its floor division by 3, but the exact value of `a` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the updated state for `a` is that it must now be a non-negative integer resulting from the floor division of the original `a` by 3.

Output State: **`a` must be a non-negative integer resulting from the floor division of the original `a` by 3, `b` must be greater than 0, `ans` is `3k`, `3k+1`, or `3k+2`**
