The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and an integer `sep`. Each element in `l` represents a difference requirement for divisors. The function constructs a string by converting each integer in the list to a string, joins them with the separator `sep`, and then prints this string. There is no return value from the function. Potential edge cases include an empty list `l` or invalid values for `sep`. If `l` is empty, the function will simply print nothing. If `sep` is not a valid separator (e.g., a non-string), the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to use it with `str.join`.
