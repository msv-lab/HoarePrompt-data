The function `func_3()` accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` from the user input. It then returns a list containing all characters of the string `s` except for the last character. This means that if the input string ends with a non-digit character, as implied by the initial comment, the last character is removed. The function handles strings that end with digit characters as well, ensuring that only the last character is excluded from the returned list. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.
