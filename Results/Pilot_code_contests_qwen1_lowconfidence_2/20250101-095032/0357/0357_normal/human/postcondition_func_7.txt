The function `func_8` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, an integer `x`, and two integers `low` and `high` representing the boundaries of the search range. It performs a binary search to find the position of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns `mid, mid`, indicating the index of `x` in the list. If `x` is not found, it narrows down the search range by recursively calling itself with updated boundaries until the search range is invalid (`high < low`). In this case, it returns `high, low`. The function effectively finds the position of `x` or determines its insertion point in the sorted list.
