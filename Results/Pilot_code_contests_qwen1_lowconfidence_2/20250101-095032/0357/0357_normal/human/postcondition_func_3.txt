The function reads a string `s` from the user input, which is guaranteed to end with a newline character and have a length greater than 1. It then returns the input string `s` with the trailing newline character removed. The function ensures that any string input provided by the user, except those that do not meet the criteria (i.e., strings with a length of 1 or less, or strings without a trailing newline character), will have the trailing newline character stripped off. If such edge cases occur, the function will either raise an error or produce unexpected results due to the lack of input validation.
