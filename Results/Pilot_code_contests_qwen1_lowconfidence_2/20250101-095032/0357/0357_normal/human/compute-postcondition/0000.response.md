The code `d = func_1()` assigns the value returned by the function `func_1()` to the variable `d`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `d`. However, we know from the initial state that `d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10000\). The sorted list of prime numbers `primes` and the fact that `d` is within the specified range are unaffected by the assignment.

Output State: **primes is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10000\) and `d` equals the value returned by `func_1()`**
