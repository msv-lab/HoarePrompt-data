Functionality: **The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number or meets certain specific conditions, and `False` otherwise. Specifically, the function returns `False` for `n` values less than or equal to 3 (except 2 and 3), and also for numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3. For other values of `n`, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or 3, which should return `True`, but the code currently returns `False` for these values. Additionally, the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes `n > 1` which might lead to unexpected behavior if this condition is not met.**
