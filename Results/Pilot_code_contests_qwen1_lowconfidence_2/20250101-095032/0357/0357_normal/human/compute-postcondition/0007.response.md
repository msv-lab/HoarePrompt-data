Let's analyze the given conditions step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Conditions:
- `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
- `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`.
- `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
- `j` is `i + 3`.
- The condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must be true for the loop to continue.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`.

### Current State:
- `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
- `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`.
- `i` is determined by the function call `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
- `j` is `i + 3`.
- The condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` is currently true.

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must still hold true. This means that after the loop body executes, the condition must remain true. 

Since the only elements that change within the loop body are the values of `i` and `j`, and since `j` is defined as `i + 3`, the only way to ensure the condition remains true is to ensure that `i` and `j` are updated in such a way that `primes[j] - primes[i]` remains less than `d`.

However, based on the information provided, no specific updates to the values of `i` and `j` are specified in the loop body. Therefore, we cannot directly infer how these values will change or what adjustments are necessary to ensure the condition remains true.

Given the current state, we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`. Since the condition is currently true, we do not need to adjust any states explicitly for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
No specific adjustments are required to the states for the loop to execute one more time based on the given conditions.

State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`**
