The code `print(primes[i] * primes[j])` prints the product of the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the list `primes`. However, the values of `i` and `j` are determined by the function call `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` and the subsequent comparison `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`. Since the exact values of `i` and `j` are not specified and depend on the internal workings of `func_8`, we cannot determine their exact values without more information. But we know that `i` and `j` are indices within the range of the list `primes`.

The output of the print statement is the product of `primes[i]` and `primes[j]`, but the exact value of this product is not known from the given information.

Output State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is the smallest index such that `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`, the output of the print statement is `primes[i] * primes[j]`.**
