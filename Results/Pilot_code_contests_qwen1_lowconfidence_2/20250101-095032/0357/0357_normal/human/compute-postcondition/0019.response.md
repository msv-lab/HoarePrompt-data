According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i * i <= n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 17, and `n` is an integer at least 121.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `i * i <= n`:

- Currently, `i` is 17.
- The next value of `i` would be 18.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `18 * 18 <= n` must be true.

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate `18 * 18`:
   \[
   18 * 18 = 324
   \]

2. For the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 324.

Since `n` must be at least 324 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 324 and `i` is 17**
