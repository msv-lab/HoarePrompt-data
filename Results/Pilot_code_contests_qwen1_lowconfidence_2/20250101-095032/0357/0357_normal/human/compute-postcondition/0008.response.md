`j` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `j` is equal to `i + 3`. After the increment, `j` becomes `i + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers
- `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`
- `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`
- `j` is `i + 4`
- `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`

Output State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1), `j` is `i + 4`, and `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`**
