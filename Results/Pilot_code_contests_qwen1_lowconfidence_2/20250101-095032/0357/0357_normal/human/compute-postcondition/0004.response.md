The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
- `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`.
- `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
- `j` is `i + 1`.

Since `j` is initially `i + 1`, incrementing `j` by 1 means `j` will become `(i + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 2`.

Output State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 2`**
