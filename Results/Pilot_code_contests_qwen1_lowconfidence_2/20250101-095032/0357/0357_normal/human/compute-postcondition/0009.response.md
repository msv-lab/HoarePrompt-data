Let's analyze the given loop step by step based on the provided output states after a few iterations.

### Initial State:
- `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
- `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`.
- `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
- `j` is `i + 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
    j += 1
```

### Observations from Provided Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `j` becomes `i + 2`.
   - `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`.

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `j` becomes `i + 3`.
   - `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`.

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `j` becomes `i + 4`.
   - `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`.

From these observations, we can deduce that with each iteration of the loop, `j` increases by 1. Therefore, after `k` iterations, `j` will be `i + k + 1`.

### General Formulation:
- After `k` iterations, `j = i + k + 1`.
- The condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must still hold.

### Final State Analysis:
Since the loop continues as long as `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`, eventually `primes[j] - primes[i]` will no longer be less than `d`. At this point, the loop will terminate.

- **Final Value of `j`**: `j` will be the smallest index such that `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`. Since `j` increments by 1 each iteration, the final value of `j` will be the first index where `primes[j] - primes[i]` is no longer less than `d`.
- **Condition**: `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`.

### Output State:
- `primes` remains a sorted list of prime numbers.
- `d` remains a value returned by `func_1()`.
- `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
- `j` is the smallest index such that `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is the smallest index such that `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`**.
