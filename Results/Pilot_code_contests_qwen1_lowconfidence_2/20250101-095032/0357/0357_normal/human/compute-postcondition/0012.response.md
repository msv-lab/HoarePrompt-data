Functionality: **The function processes a sorted list of prime numbers and a positive integer \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq d \leq 10000 \)). It then finds two consecutive prime numbers in the list such that their difference is at least \( d \), and prints their product. If no such pair of primes exists, the function's behavior is undefined based on the given code.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list of primes is empty or contains fewer than two elements, the function will likely raise an error due to indexing out of bounds.
- If the difference between any two consecutive primes in the list is already greater than or equal to \( d \), the function will immediately print the product of these primes and terminate the loop early.
- If no pair of consecutive primes in the list satisfies the condition \( \text{primes}[j] - \text{primes}[i] \geq d \), the function will continue to increment \( j \) until the end of the list is reached, which could result in undefined behavior if the loop condition is never met.
