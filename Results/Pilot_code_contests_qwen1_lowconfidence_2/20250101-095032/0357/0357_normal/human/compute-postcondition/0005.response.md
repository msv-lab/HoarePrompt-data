Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`. This means the loop continues as long as the difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the `primes` list is less than `d`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
   - `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`.
   - `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
   - `j` is `i + 2`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must be true. 

4. **Analyze the Current Values**:
   - Since `i` is determined by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, the exact value of `i` is not known without the function implementation details.
   - `j` is `i + 2`, so we know that `j` is two indices ahead of `i`.
   - The current values of `primes[i]` and `primes[j]` are part of the sorted list `primes`.

5. **Ensure the Condition is Met**:
   - For the loop to continue, `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`.
   - To ensure this, `primes[j]` should be sufficiently close to `primes[i]` relative to the value of `d`.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The key variable here is `primes[j] - primes[i]`, which needs to be less than `d`.
   - Since `i` and `j` are determined by the function `func_8` and `d` is determined by `func_1`, we need to ensure that the condition can still be met.

Given the above analysis, the critical adjustment needed is to ensure that the difference between `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` remains less than `d`. Since the exact values are not specified, we focus on ensuring the condition is possible.

**State Adjustment**:
- The state must ensure that the difference `primes[j] - primes[i]` is still less than `d`.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration, to allow the loop to execute one more time, is:
**`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`**.

State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`**.
