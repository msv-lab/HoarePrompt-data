The code assigns the result of `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` to `i`. Specifically, `func_8` returns a tuple where the second element is assigned to `i`. The value of `d` is determined by `func_1()`, which means `d` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000. Since the exact value of `d` is not given, we keep it as `d` in the output state.

The function `func_8` is applied to the list `primes`, which is a sorted list of prime numbers, with arguments `d + 1`, `0`, and `len(primes) - 1`. However, without knowing the specifics of `func_8`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` directly from this information alone. But we know that `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **primes is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10000\) and equals the value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`**
