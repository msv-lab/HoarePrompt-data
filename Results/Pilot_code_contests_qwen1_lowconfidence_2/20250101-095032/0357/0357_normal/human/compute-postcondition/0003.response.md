Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
- `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`.
- `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
- `j` is `i + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition checks if `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers.
   - `i` is determined by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.
   - `j` is `i + 1`.

3. **Understand the Role of Each Variable**:
   - `i` is set by `func_8` based on the input parameters (`d + 1`, `0`, `len(primes) - 1`).
   - `j` is simply `i + 1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute at Least Once**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, we need `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` to be true when the loop starts.

5. **Analyze the Conditions**:
   - Since `primes` is a sorted list, `primes[j]` and `primes[i]` are consecutive elements in the list (with `j = i + 1`).
   - Therefore, the smallest possible difference between two consecutive primes is the difference between the smallest two primes in the list.

6. **Consider the Initial Values**:
   - If `d` is very small, it might not satisfy the condition for the first iteration.
   - However, since `primes` is a list of prime numbers, and the difference between any two consecutive primes is non-negative, we can always find such `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition for at least one iteration.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - There is no specific adjustment needed for the given state to ensure the loop can execute at least once because the loop condition will inherently be checked starting from the provided values.

### Final Answer:
Since no specific adjustments are needed to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we can simply repeat the current state.

State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 1`**
