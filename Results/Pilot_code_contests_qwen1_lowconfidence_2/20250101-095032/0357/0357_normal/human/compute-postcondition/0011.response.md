The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parameter list. Based on the provided information, the function will process a sorted list of prime numbers and a positive integer `d` such that `1 <= d <= 10000`. However, since these are not included as parameters in the function definition, they must be considered external inputs or predefined variables.

Given the nature of the problem, the function likely processes the sorted list of prime numbers and the integer `d` to produce some kind of output. Since no specific output cases are provided, we can only describe the accepted inputs and the implied processing:

The functionality of the function `func_9` is to process a sorted list of prime numbers and a positive integer `d` where `1 <= d <= 10000`.

Functionality: **The function processes a sorted list of prime numbers and a positive integer `d` where `1 <= d <= 10000`.**
