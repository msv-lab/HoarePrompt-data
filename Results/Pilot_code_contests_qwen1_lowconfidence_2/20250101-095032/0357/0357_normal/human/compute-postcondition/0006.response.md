`j` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `j` is `i + 2`. After incrementing `j`, the new value of `j` becomes `(i + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `primes[j] - primes[i]` must be less than `d`**
