According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i * i <= n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 25, and `i` is 11. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i * i <= n` still holds true. Given that `i` is 11 and `n` is 25, we calculate `i * i` as follows:

\[ i * i = 11 * 11 = 121 \]

Since 121 is not less than or equal to 25, the condition `i * i <= n` is not satisfied. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time based on the current values.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * i <= n` must be true. To satisfy this condition, we need to adjust either `n` or `i` such that `i * i <= n` holds true. Since `i` is currently 11, to keep the loop executing, we need to increase `n` to be at least 121.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 121.

State: **`n` must be at least 121, `i` is 11**
