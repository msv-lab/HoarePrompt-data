The function `func_1()` accepts an integer input from the user within the range of 1 to 3000 and returns it. This integer input will be assigned to the variable `t`. The function does not perform any operations with the input and simply returns it as is. There are no additional variables `d` involved in the function. The function ensures that the returned integer is within the specified range. If the user inputs a value outside the range, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the given code, but the function will still return an integer input within the valid range upon execution.
