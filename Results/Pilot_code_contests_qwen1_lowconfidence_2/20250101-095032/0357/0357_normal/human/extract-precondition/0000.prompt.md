You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.
Program:
```
def func_9():
    d = func_1()
    i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
    j = i + 1
    while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
        j += 1
    print(primes[i] * primes[j])
```
