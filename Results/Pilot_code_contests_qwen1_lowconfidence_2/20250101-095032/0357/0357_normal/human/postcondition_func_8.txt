The function processes a sorted list of prime numbers and a positive integer \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq d \leq 10000 \)). It then finds two consecutive prime numbers in the list such that their difference is at least \( d \), and prints their product. If no such pair of primes exists, the function's behavior is undefined based on the given code.
