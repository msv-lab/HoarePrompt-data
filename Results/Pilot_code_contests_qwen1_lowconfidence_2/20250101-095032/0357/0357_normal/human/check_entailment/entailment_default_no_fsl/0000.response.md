Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the smallest positive integer \( a \) that meets the specified conditions. Specifically, the function `func_9` does not ensure that the integer \( a \) has at least 4 divisors. The code searches for two consecutive prime numbers in the list `primes` such that their difference is at least \( d \) and then prints their product. However, this approach does not guarantee that the product of these two primes will have at least 4 divisors.

To illustrate, consider the test case where \( d = 1 \). The smallest product of two consecutive primes that satisfy \( p_j - p_i \geq d \) is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \). While 6 does have 4 divisors (1, 2, 3, 6), the code does not ensure that no smaller integer meeting the criteria exists. For instance, for \( d = 2 \), the smallest product of two consecutive primes is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \), which indeed has 4 divisors (1, 3, 5, 15). However, the code does not check if there is a smaller integer that satisfies the conditions, such as 6, which has 4 divisors and a difference of 2 between its divisors.

Thus, the code fails to meet the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
