Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the smallest positive integer `a` that meets the criteria is less than or equal to 6. According to the problem description, the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least `d` should be found. However, the code starts searching from the smallest prime number greater than or equal to `d + 1` and checks for consecutive primes with a difference of at least `d`. 

For instance, consider the case where `d = 1`. The smallest integer `a` that satisfies the conditions should be 6, which has divisors `[1, 2, 3, 6]`. The difference between any two divisors is at least 1, and 6 is the smallest such integer. However, the code will start checking from the smallest prime number greater than or equal to `d + 1 = 2`, which is 2. Since 2 is not a valid starting point to generate a number with at least 4 divisors, the code fails to correctly identify 6 as the smallest integer.

To fix this, the code needs to handle the special case where `d = 1` separately and return 6 as the result.
