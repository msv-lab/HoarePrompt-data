Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to find the smallest positive integer \( a \) that satisfies the conditions as described:

1. **Condition**: \( a \) should have at least 4 divisors.
2. **Condition**: The difference between any two divisors of \( a \) should be at least \( d \).

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Function `func_9()` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_9()` attempts to use prime numbers to generate a candidate \( a \). However, it does not ensure that the generated number \( a \) has at least 4 divisors or that the difference between any two divisors is at least \( d \).
   - The approach used to select prime numbers and compute their product does not guarantee that the resulting number \( a \) meets the required conditions. For example, the product of two small primes might not have enough divisors, or the differences between the divisors might not be sufficient.

2. **Lack of Proper Divisor Calculation**:
   - The program does not include a function that checks whether a number \( a \) has at least 4 divisors and ensures that the difference between any two divisors is at least \( d \). Instead, it relies on generating products of prime numbers, which is not a guaranteed method to meet the problem requirements.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - While the input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are correctly implemented to read inputs, they are not used in a way that ensures the final output meets the problem's constraints.

4. **No Verification Logic**:
   - There is no logic within the program that verifies whether a generated number \( a \) satisfies the conditions. The program simply prints the product of two primes without checking if the result meets the specified criteria.

#### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the test case with \( d = 2 \):

- The program might generate \( a = 15 \) (as in the provided example), which has divisors \([1, 3, 5, 15]\). While these divisors satisfy the condition of having at least 4 divisors, the difference between some divisors (e.g., 1 and 3) is less than 2, violating the requirement that the difference between any two divisors must be at least \( d \).

To meet the problem description, the program needs to include a proper verification step that checks whether the generated number \( a \) satisfies both conditions (having at least 4 divisors and ensuring the difference between any two divisors is at least \( d \)). The current implementation does not provide this verification, making it incorrect according to the problem statement.
