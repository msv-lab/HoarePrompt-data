You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic to find the smallest positive integer `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the program seems to be attempting to find the smallest prime product greater than or equal to a predefined list of primes (`primes`). However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting integer will have at least 4 divisors and that the difference between any two divisors is at least `d`.

Here's a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the input `d = 1`. According to the problem description, we need to find the smallest positive integer `a` that has at least 4 divisors and the difference between any two divisors is at least 1. The smallest such number is `6`, which has divisors `[1, 2, 3, 6]`. However, the program does not seem to handle this case correctly.

Since the program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to produce the correct output for certain inputs, the correctness is `False`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    readAll = sys.stdin.read
p = [False] * 21001
for i in xrange(1, 21001):
    p[i] = func_7(i)
primes = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(p) if x]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in xrange(func_1()):
        func_9()
    if testing:
        sys.stdout = cmd
        print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3000, and for each test case, d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10000.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user, which is within the range of 1 to 3000 for variable 't' and 1 to 10000 for variable 'd'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` accepts an integer input from the user within the range of 1 to 3000 and returns it. This integer input will be assigned to the variable `t`. The function does not perform any operations with the input and simply returns it as is. There are no additional variables `d` involved in the function. The function ensures that the returned integer is within the specified range. If the user inputs a value outside the range, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the given code, but the function will still return an integer input within the valid range upon execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function are defined or used, and the function does not take any parameters or return any values related to the problem description.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from user input split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converting each string to an integer and returning them as a list. The function performs no validation on the input, so it could fail if the user inputs non-integer values. No error handling is included for such cases.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer followed by a non-digit character.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list of characters from the string 's' excluding the last character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` from the user input. It then returns a list containing all characters of the string `s` except for the last character. This means that if the input string ends with a non-digit character, as implied by the initial comment, the last character is removed. The function handles strings that end with digit characters as well, ensuring that only the last character is excluded from the returned list. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that ends with a newline character and has a length greater than 1.
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns the input string `s` without the trailing newline character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string `s` from the user input, which is guaranteed to end with a newline character and have a length greater than 1. It then returns the input string `s` with the trailing newline character removed. The function ensures that any string input provided by the user, except those that do not meet the criteria (i.e., strings with a length of 1 or less, or strings without a trailing newline character), will have the trailing newline character stripped off. If such edge cases occur, the function will either raise an error or produce unexpected results due to the lack of input validation.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing the test cases, where each element in the list is an integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000) corresponding to the difference requirement for the divisors.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(map(str, l)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and an integer `sep`. Each element in `l` represents a difference requirement for divisors. The function constructs a string by converting each integer in the list to a string, joins them with the separator `sep`, and then prints this string. There is no return value from the function. Potential edge cases include an empty list `l` or invalid values for `sep`. If `l` is empty, the function will simply print nothing. If `sep` is not a valid separator (e.g., a non-string), the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to use it with `str.join`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the square of the number for which we want to find its divisors.
def func_6(n):
    i = 1
    sq_n = n ** 0.5
    divs = []
    while i <= sq_n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if n / i != i:
                divs.append(n / i)
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `sqrt(n) + 1`, `sq_n` is the square root of `n`, `divs` contains all unique divisors of `n` such that each divisor `d` and its corresponding quotient `n/d` are both added to `divs` if they are different. If `n` is a perfect square, the smaller divisor is repeated in the list.
    return sorted(divs)
    #`The program returns a sorted list of all unique divisors of n, including the smaller divisor repeated if n is a perfect square, with each divisor and its corresponding quotient (n/d) being added if they are different`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer representing the square of the number for which we want to find its divisors. The function calculates all unique divisors of `n`, including the smaller divisor repeated if `n` is a perfect square, and returns a sorted list of these divisors. The algorithm iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility. For each divisor found, both the divisor and its corresponding quotient (if different) are added to the list `divs`. Finally, the function returns a sorted list of these divisors. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the only divisor is 1), or when `n` is a perfect square (in which case the smaller divisor is repeated).

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that n > 1.
def func_7(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that n > 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that n > 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that n > 3 and n is not divisible by 2 and n is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer that is not divisible by 2 and 3 and is at least 1089, `i` is 29
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number or meets certain specific conditions, and `False` otherwise. Specifically, the function returns `False` for `n` values less than or equal to 3 (except 2 and 3), and also for numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3. For other values of `n`, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or 3, which should return `True`, but the code currently returns `False` for these values. Additionally, the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes `n > 1` which might lead to unexpected behavior if this condition is not met.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, x is an integer, low is an integer representing the lower index boundary of the search range, and high is an integer representing the upper index boundary of the search range such that 0 <= low <= high < len(arr).
def func_8(arr, x, low, high):
    if (high >= low) :
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if (arr[mid] == x) :
            return mid, mid
            #`The program returns mid, mid`
        else :
            if (arr[mid] > x) :
                return func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
                #`The program returns the result of the function call func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)` where `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an integer, `low` is an integer representing the lower index boundary of the search range, and `mid - 1` is the new upper index boundary of the search range such that `low <= mid - 1 < high`.
            else :
                return func_8(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
                #The program returns the result of calling function `func_8` with arguments `arr`, `x`, `mid + 1`, and `high`, where `mid` is the integer value of `(high + low) // 2` and it is given that `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`
    else :
        return high, low
        #`The program returns high and low`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, an integer `x`, and two integers `low` and `high` representing the boundaries of the search range. It performs a binary search to find the position of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns `mid, mid`, indicating the index of `x` in the list. If `x` is not found, it narrows down the search range by recursively calling itself with updated boundaries until the search range is invalid (`high < low`). In this case, it returns `high, low`. The function effectively finds the position of `x` or determines its insertion point in the sorted list.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primes is a sorted list of prime numbers, d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= 10000.
def func_9():
    d = func_1()
    i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
    j = i + 1
    while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
        j += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `primes` is a sorted list of prime numbers, `d` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is the smallest index such that `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`
    print(primes[i] * primes[j])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sorted list of prime numbers and a positive integer \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq d \leq 10000 \)). It then finds two consecutive prime numbers in the list such that their difference is at least \( d \), and prints their product. If no such pair of primes exists, the function's behavior is undefined based on the given code.
