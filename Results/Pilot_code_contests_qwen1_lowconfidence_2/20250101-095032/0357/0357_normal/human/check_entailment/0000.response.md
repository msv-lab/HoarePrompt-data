Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not actually implement the required functionality. The program includes several helper functions but does not use them to solve the problem. Specifically, it references a `primes` list which is not defined within the provided code. Additionally, there is no main function that processes the input and outputs the required result.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the input `t` (number of test cases).
2. For each test case, read the value of `d`.
3. Find the smallest positive integer `a` that has at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least `d`.
4. Output the result for each test case.

Since the provided code does not implement these steps, it fails to meet the problem requirements and thus is incorrect.
