Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the smallest positive integer \( a \) that meets the given conditions. Specifically, the code does not properly find the smallest integer with at least 4 divisors and ensures that the difference between any two divisors is at least \( d \).

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**:
   - The core logic in `func_9()` is flawed. It attempts to find two consecutive prime numbers whose difference is at least \( d \) and multiplies them. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting number \( a \) will have at least 4 divisors and that the difference condition is met.
   
2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle the smallest integers with at least 4 divisors, such as 6 (divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]) or 10 (divisors: [1, 2, 5, 10]).
   - The code does not ensure that the constructed number \( a \) meets both conditions simultaneously (having at least 4 divisors and the difference condition).

3. **Example Validation**:
   - Given the test cases:
     - For \( d = 1 \): The smallest number with at least 4 divisors is 6, but the code might fail to generate this correctly.
     - For \( d = 2 \): The smallest number with at least 4 divisors is 15, but again, the code might not generate this correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
