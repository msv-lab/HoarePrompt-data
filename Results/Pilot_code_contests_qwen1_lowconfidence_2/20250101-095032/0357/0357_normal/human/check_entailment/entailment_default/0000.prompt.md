You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    readAll = sys.stdin.read
p = [False] * 21001
for i in xrange(1, 21001):
    p[i] = func_7(i)
primes = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(p) if x]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in xrange(func_1()):
        func_9()
    if testing:
        sys.stdout = cmd
        print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` accepts an integer input from the user within the range of 1 to 3000 and returns it. This integer input will be assigned to the variable `t`. The function does not perform any operations with the input and simply returns it as is. There are no additional variables `d` involved in the function. The function ensures that the returned integer is within the specified range. If the user inputs a value outside the range, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the given code, but the function will still return an integer input within the valid range upon execution.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converting each string to an integer and returning them as a list. The function performs no validation on the input, so it could fail if the user inputs non-integer values. No error handling is included for such cases.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` from the user input. It then returns a list containing all characters of the string `s` except for the last character. This means that if the input string ends with a non-digit character, as implied by the initial comment, the last character is removed. The function handles strings that end with digit characters as well, ensuring that only the last character is excluded from the returned list. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads a string `s` from the user input, which is guaranteed to end with a newline character and have a length greater than 1. It then returns the input string `s` with the trailing newline character removed. The function ensures that any string input provided by the user, except those that do not meet the criteria (i.e., strings with a length of 1 or less, or strings without a trailing newline character), will have the trailing newline character stripped off. If such edge cases occur, the function will either raise an error or produce unexpected results due to the lack of input validation.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l, sep=' '):
    print(sep.join(map(str, l)))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and an integer `sep`. Each element in `l` represents a difference requirement for divisors. The function constructs a string by converting each integer in the list to a string, joins them with the separator `sep`, and then prints this string. There is no return value from the function. Potential edge cases include an empty list `l` or invalid values for `sep`. If `l` is empty, the function will simply print nothing. If `sep` is not a valid separator (e.g., a non-string), the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to use it with `str.join`.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n):
    i = 1
    sq_n = n ** 0.5
    divs = []
    while i <= sq_n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if n / i != i:
                divs.append(n / i)
        i = i + 1
    return sorted(divs)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer representing the square of the number for which we want to find its divisors. The function calculates all unique divisors of `n`, including the smaller divisor repeated if `n` is a perfect square, and returns a sorted list of these divisors. The algorithm iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility. For each divisor found, both the divisor and its corresponding quotient (if different) are added to the list `divs`. Finally, the function returns a sorted list of these divisors. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the only divisor is 1), or when `n` is a perfect square (in which case the smaller divisor is repeated).
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number or meets certain specific conditions, and `False` otherwise. Specifically, the function returns `False` for `n` values less than or equal to 3 (except 2 and 3), and also for numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3. For other values of `n`, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 2 or 3, which should return `True`, but the code currently returns `False` for these values. Additionally, the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes `n > 1` which might lead to unexpected behavior if this condition is not met.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(arr, x, low, high):
    if high >= low:
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return (mid, mid)
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            return func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return func_8(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
    else:
        return (high, low)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, an integer `x`, and two integers `low` and `high` representing the boundaries of the search range. It performs a binary search to find the position of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns `mid, mid`, indicating the index of `x` in the list. If `x` is not found, it narrows down the search range by recursively calling itself with updated boundaries until the search range is invalid (`high < low`). In this case, it returns `high, low`. The function effectively finds the position of `x` or determines its insertion point in the sorted list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    d = func_1()
    i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
    j = i + 1
    while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
        j += 1
    print(primes[i] * primes[j])
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function processes a sorted list of prime numbers and a positive integer \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq d \leq 10000 \)). It then finds two consecutive prime numbers in the list such that their difference is at least \( d \), and prints their product. If no such pair of primes exists, the function's behavior is undefined based on the given code.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
