The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer representing the square of the number for which we want to find its divisors. The function calculates all unique divisors of `n`, including the smaller divisor repeated if `n` is a perfect square, and returns a sorted list of these divisors. The algorithm iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility. For each divisor found, both the divisor and its corresponding quotient (if different) are added to the list `divs`. Finally, the function returns a sorted list of these divisors. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the only divisor is 1), or when `n` is a perfect square (in which case the smaller divisor is repeated).
