Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The input consists of n lines, each containing two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000, representing points in a set where if (x, y) is in the set, then all points (x', y') such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y are also in the set. The next line contains n integers wi such that -100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000, representing the required special values for the points in an aesthetically pleasing numbering.**
