Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the required special values (wi) do not form a valid aesthetically pleasing numbering. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the special values (yi - xi) are non-decreasing as we move from left to right and bottom to top in the grid.

Consider the following input:
```
5
1 0
0 0
2 0
1 1
0 1
0 1 2 1 0
```

In this case, the special values are 0, 1, 2, 1, 0. The program attempts to assign the points based on these values but does not check if the resulting numbering is aesthetically pleasing. The correct numbering should ensure that for any point (x, y) with number i, all points (x', y') with x' ≥ x and y' ≥ y have numbers not less than i.

The program will incorrectly output "YES" and a numbering scheme that does not meet the aesthetic condition. For example, it might output:
```
YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
1 1
0 1
```

However, this numbering is not aesthetically pleasing because the point (1, 1) (which should have a higher number due to its position) is assigned a lower number than (0, 1).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not validate the aesthetic condition for the numbering.
