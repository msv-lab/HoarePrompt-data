Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the special values \(w_i\) are correctly mapped to points \((x_i, y_i)\) such that \(y_i - x_i = w_i\) and the aesthetic condition is satisfied. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Point Mapping and Special Values**: The code does not ensure that each point is uniquely mapped to its special value \(w_i\). Instead, it uses a counter `mem` to count occurrences of each special value and then attempts to match points to these values. However, it does not guarantee that each point \((x, y)\) with \(y - x = w_i\) is correctly numbered according to the aesthetic condition.

2. **Aesthetic Condition Violation**: The code checks for conflicts using `labels`, but it does not properly enforce the aesthetic condition across all points. For instance, if a point \((x, y)\) is assigned a number \(i\) and there is a point \((x', y')\) with \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) that should have a number not less than \(i\), the current implementation does not ensure this condition is met for all points.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for ensuring the aesthetic condition is not fully implemented. The code sorts points by their special values but does not properly enforce the requirement that points \((x', y')\) with \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) must be assigned numbers not less than \(i\).

To illustrate, consider the following example:
```
Input:
5
1 1
1 0
0 1
2 2
0 0
1 0 0 1 2
```
The expected output should be "YES" and a valid aesthetically pleasing numbering. However, the provided code might fail to produce this due to the above-mentioned issues.

Given these flaws, the code does not correctly implement the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
