You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wilbur is playing with a set of n points on the coordinate plane. All points have non-negative integer coordinates. Moreover, if some point (x, y) belongs to the set, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y also belong to this set.

Now Wilbur wants to number the points in the set he has, that is assign them distinct integer numbers from 1 to n. In order to make the numbering aesthetically pleasing, Wilbur imposes the condition that if some point (x, y) gets number i, then all (x',y') from the set, such that x' ≥ x and y' ≥ y must be assigned a number not less than i. For example, for a set of four points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1), there are two aesthetically pleasing numberings. One is 1, 2, 3, 4 and another one is 1, 3, 2, 4.

Wilbur's friend comes along and challenges Wilbur. For any point he defines it's special value as s(x, y) = y - x. Now he gives Wilbur some w1, w2,..., wn, and asks him to find an aesthetically pleasing numbering of the points in the set, such that the point that gets number i has it's special value equal to wi, that is s(xi, yi) = yi - xi = wi.

Now Wilbur asks you to help him with this challenge.

Input

The first line of the input consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of points in the set Wilbur is playing with.

Next follow n lines with points descriptions. Each line contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000), that give one point in Wilbur's set. It's guaranteed that all points are distinct. Also, it is guaranteed that if some point (x, y) is present in the input, then all points (x', y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y, are also present in the input.

The last line of the input contains n integers. The i-th of them is wi ( - 100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000) — the required special value of the point that gets number i in any aesthetically pleasing numbering.

Output

If there exists an aesthetically pleasant numbering of points in the set, such that s(xi, yi) = yi - xi = wi, then print "YES" on the first line of the output. Otherwise, print "NO".

If a solution exists, proceed output with n lines. On the i-th of these lines print the point of the set that gets number i. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0


Output

YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
1 1


Input

3
1 0
0 0
2 0
0 1 2


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, point (2, 0) gets number 3, point (0, 0) gets number one, point (1, 0) gets number 2, point (1, 1) gets number 5 and point (0, 1) gets number 4. One can easily check that this numbering is aesthetically pleasing and yi - xi = wi.

In the second sample, the special values of the points in the set are 0,  - 1, and  - 2 while the sequence that the friend gives to Wilbur is 0, 1, 2. Therefore, the answer does not exist.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(n, labels) = (int(input()), [[0 for _ in range(1000)] for _ in range(1000)])
(a, w) = ([rints() for _ in range(n)], rints())
func_1()

def func_1():
    (mem, mem2, out) = (Counter(w), defaultdict(list), [])
    for (x, y) in a:
        mem2[y - x].append([x, y])
    for (i, j) in mem.items():
        if len(mem2[i]) != j:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = mem2[w[i]][-1]
        labels[x][y] = i + 1
        if i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))
    print('YES')
    print('\n'.join(out))


```
Output hints: The function processes an integer \(n\), followed by \(n\) lines of pairs of integers \((x, y)\) representing a set of points, and finally \(n\) integers \(wi\). It verifies whether the points and their associated values can be arranged in a specific order according to the rules defined by the input. If the arrangement is possible, it outputs "YES" and prints the final configuration; otherwise, it prints "NO" and exits early. Specifically, the function checks that for each \(wi\), the corresponding \((x, y)\) pairs are correctly ordered and that no conflicts arise when assigning the values \(1\) to \(n\) to the points.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
