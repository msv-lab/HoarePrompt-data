Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of points `n` and the points themselves in the form of pairs `(x, y)`.
   - It then reads the special values `wi` for each point.

2. **Processing and Validation:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `mem2` to group points by their special value `y - x`. This ensures that points with the same special value are processed together.
   - It checks if the count of points for each special value matches the expected count from the `mem` (Counter of `w`). If not, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - It sorts the points within each group in descending order to ensure the aesthetic pleasing condition is met.

3. **Assigning Numbers:**
   - The program iterates through the special values and assigns numbers to the points ensuring the aesthetic pleasing condition.
   - It maintains a matrix `labels` to keep track of the assigned numbers.
   - It checks for conflicts during the assignment process to ensure the aesthetic pleasing condition is maintained.

4. **Output:**
   - If the assignment is successful, it prints "YES" and outputs the final configuration.
   - If any conflict is detected, it prints "NO" and exits.

### Key Points Addressed:
- **Aesthetic Pleasing Condition:** The program correctly handles the requirement that if some point `(x, y)` gets number `i`, then all `(x', y')` from the set, such that `x' ≥ x` and `y' ≥ y` must be assigned a number not less than `i`.
- **Special Value Matching:** The program correctly checks and assigns numbers based on the special values `wi` provided.
- **Validation:** The program ensures that the count of points for each special value matches the expected count, preventing invalid configurations.

Since the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary validations, the program is correct.
