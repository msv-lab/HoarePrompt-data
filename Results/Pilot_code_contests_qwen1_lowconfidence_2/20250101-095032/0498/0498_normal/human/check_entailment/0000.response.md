Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the aesthetically pleasing condition is met for all points. 

Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0

Expected Output:
YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
1 1
```

However, the provided solution attempts to assign points based on the special values but does not guarantee that the aesthetically pleasing condition is satisfied for all points. For instance, in the given example, the point `(0, 1)` should have a higher label than the point `(0, 0)` since `(0, 1)` has a larger y-coordinate. However, the program does not enforce this constraint correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider the points and their special values again:

- Point `(2, 0)` with `w[0] = -1` should be labeled before `(0, 0)` with `w[1] = -1`.
- Point `(1, 0)` with `w[2] = -2` should be labeled before both `(2, 0)` and `(0, 0)`.
- Point `(1, 1)` with `w[3] = 1` should be labeled after `(1, 0)`.
- Point `(0, 1)` with `w[4] = 0` should be labeled after `(1, 0)` and `(0, 0)`.

The program does not properly handle the sorting and assignment of labels to ensure the aesthetically pleasing condition is met for all points. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.
