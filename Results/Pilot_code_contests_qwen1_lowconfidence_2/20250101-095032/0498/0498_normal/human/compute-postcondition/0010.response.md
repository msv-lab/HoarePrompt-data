The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the printed output, but this is not included in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and `mem` must contain at least one item. The current length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`. Printed output is 'NO'.**
