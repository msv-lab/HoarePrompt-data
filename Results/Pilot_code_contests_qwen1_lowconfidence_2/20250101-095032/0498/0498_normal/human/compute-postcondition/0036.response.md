The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, for every key `i` in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `mem2[w[0]]` does not contain `[x, y]`, `out` contains the string `"x y"`, `i` is 1, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `labels[x][y]` is 2.**
