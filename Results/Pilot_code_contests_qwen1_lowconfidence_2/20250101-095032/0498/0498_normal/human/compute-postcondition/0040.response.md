Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `mem2[w[1]]` is sorted in descending order.
   - `mem2[w[1]]` does not contain `[x, y]`.
   - `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `labels[x][y]` is 2.

2. **Operation in the Loop**:
   - Since `i` is 1, the operation removes `x` from `mem2[w[1]]` and appends the string representation of `x` to `out`.
   - After removing `x`, `mem2[w[1]]` becomes `[a1, a2, ..., y, ...]`.

3. **State After the Operation**:
   - `mem2[w[1]]` is now `[a1, a2, ..., y, ...]`.
   - `out` now contains `"x y"`, `"x"`, and the string representation of `y` (let's call it `"y"`).
   - `i` is now 2 because we just performed the operation for `i = 1`.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `mem2[w[1]]` remains `[a1, a2, ..., y, ...]`.
   - `out` now includes `"x y"`, `"x"`, and `"y"`.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `x` is still the last element of `mem2[w[1]]` before removal.
   - `y` is still the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `labels[x][y]` is 2.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `mem2[w[1]]` remains sorted in descending order.
- `out` now includes `"x y"`, `"x"`, and `"y"`.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**`mem2[w[1]]` is a list of elements sorted in descending order, `out` contains the strings `"x y"`, `"x"`, and `"y"`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]` before removal, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` is 2.**
