The code snippet `out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))` impacts the following variables:

1. `mem2[w[i]]` will have one of its elements removed and converted to a string.
2. `out` will have a new element appended.

Given the initial state:
- `mem2[w[1]]` is a list of elements sorted in descending order.
- `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
- `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
- `labels[x][y]` remains 2.

Since `i` is 1, the code `mem2[w[i]].pop()` will pop the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, which is `x`. This element is then converted to a string and joined into a space-separated string. Let's denote this string as `str_x`.

After the operation, `out` will contain `"x y"`, `"x"`, and `str_x`.

Output State: **`mem2[w[1]]` is a list with the last element removed, `out` contains "x y", "x", and str_x, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` remains 2.**
