Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of elements.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`.
   - `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (i, j) in mem.items():
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over items in the `mem` dictionary, where `i` is the key and `j` is the value (which is the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `w`).
   - The loop continues as long as there are items left in `mem`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop iterates over the items in `mem`, and `mem` is a Counter object, it contains key-value pairs where keys are elements from `w` and values are their counts.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, one item `(i, j)` has been processed from `mem`.
   - For the loop to continue, `mem` should still contain at least one item.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `a` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `a`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `n`.
   - `mem` now contains one less item than before, but it must still be a non-empty Counter object.
   - `mem2` and `out` remain unchanged as the loop does not directly modify them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
- `mem` must still be a non-empty Counter object.
- `mem2` and `out` remain as they were.

State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` must be a non-empty Counter object, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order.**
