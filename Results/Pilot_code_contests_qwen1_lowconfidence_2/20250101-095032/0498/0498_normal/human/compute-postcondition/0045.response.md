Postcondition: **`mem2[w[1]]` is a list of elements sorted in descending order, `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` remains 2. The condition `i and (labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y])` determines whether `labels[x][y]` remains unchanged or not, but in both cases, `labels[x][y]` does not change from its original value of 2.**
