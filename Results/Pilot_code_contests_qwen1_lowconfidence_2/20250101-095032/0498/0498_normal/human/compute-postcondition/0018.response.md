The code snippet sorts the list `mem2[i]` in descending order. The variable `mem2[i]` is a list of pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = i\). Sorting this list in descending order changes the order of the elements within `mem2[i]`, but does not affect the overall structure of `mem2` or the other variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception that `mem2[i]` is now sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` must be a non-empty Counter object, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order. After sorting, `mem2[i]` is in descending order.**
