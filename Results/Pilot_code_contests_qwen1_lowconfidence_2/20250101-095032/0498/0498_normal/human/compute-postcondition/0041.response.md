The code snippet assigns the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` to `x` and the second last element to `y`. Given the initial states, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `mem2[w[1]]` is sorted in descending order.
   - `mem2[w[1]]` does not contain `[x, y]`.
   - `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `labels[x][y]` is 2.

2. **Impact of the Code Snippet**:
   - `x` is set to the last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, which is the same as the last element of `mem2[w[1]]` because `i` is 1.
   - `y` is set to the second last element of `mem2[w[i]]`, which is the same as the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]` because `i` is 1.

3. **Updated States**:
   - `x` is still the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `y` is still the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `mem2[w[1]]` remains sorted in descending order.
   - `mem2[w[1]]` does not contain `[x, y]`.
   - `out` still contains `"x y"` and `"x"`.
   - `i` is still 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `labels[x][y]` is still 2.

Given these updates, the output state is:

Output State: **`mem2[w[1]]` is a list of elements sorted in descending order, `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` is 2.**
