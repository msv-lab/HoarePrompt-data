`mem2[y - x]` appends the list `[x, y]` to itself. This means that `mem2[y - x]` now contains at least the original list `[x, y]` and possibly additional lists that were previously appended. The values of the other variables (`a`, `n`, `mem`, and `out`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `mem` is a Counter object for the list `w`; `mem2[y - x]` includes the list `[x, y]` and possibly additional lists; `out` is an empty list**
