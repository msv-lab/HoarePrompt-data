The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is exactly equal to the length of `w`, `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, for every key `i` in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order and is now empty, `out` is a list containing all the string representations of the elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` in reverse order for each iteration, and `labels` contains the values updated during each iteration. A string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
