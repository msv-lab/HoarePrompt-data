The code `mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `mem2[i]` in descending order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `mem2[i]`, the only change is the sorting of the list.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order.**
