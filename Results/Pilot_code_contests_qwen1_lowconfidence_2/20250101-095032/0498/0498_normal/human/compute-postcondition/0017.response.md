Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` must be a non-empty Counter object, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order. If `len(mem2[i]) != j`, the string 'NO' is printed to the console.***
