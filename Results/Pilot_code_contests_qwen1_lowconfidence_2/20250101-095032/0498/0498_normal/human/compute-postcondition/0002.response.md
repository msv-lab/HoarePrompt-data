`mem2[y - x]` is appended with the list `[x, y]`. Since `y - x` is used as the key, the value of `mem2[y - x]` will now include the new list `[x, y]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object for the list `w`, `mem2[y - x]` includes the list `[x, y]`, `out` is an empty list**
