Postcondition: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, for every key `i` in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `mem2[w[0]]` does not contain `[x, y]`, `out` contains the string `"x y"`, `i` is 1, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` is 2. If `i` is 1 and either `labels[x + 1][y]` is less than `labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1]` is less than `labels[x][y]`, the condition remains unchanged.**
