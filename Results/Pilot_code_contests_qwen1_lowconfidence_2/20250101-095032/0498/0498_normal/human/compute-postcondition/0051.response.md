Functionality: **The function processes an integer \(n\), followed by \(n\) lines of pairs of integers \((x, y)\) representing a set of points, and finally \(n\) integers \(wi\). It verifies whether the points and their associated values can be arranged in a specific order according to the rules defined by the input. If the arrangement is possible, it outputs "YES" and prints the final configuration; otherwise, it prints "NO" and exits early. Specifically, the function checks that for each \(wi\), the corresponding \((x, y)\) pairs are correctly ordered and that no conflicts arise when assigning the values \(1\) to \(n\) to the points.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., \(n\) is outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), or the coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) are outside the range \(0 \leq x, y \leq 100,000\)), the function will not handle these cases explicitly within the given code. However, the function assumes valid inputs based on the provided constraints.
- If the input pairs \((x, y)\) do not form a valid set as described (i.e., if there are gaps or overlaps that violate the set definition), the function will detect these issues and output "NO".

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate the initial constraints on \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\) explicitly. This means that if the input does not adhere to the specified ranges, the function may behave unpredictably.
- There is no handling for invalid or duplicate \(wi\) values, which could lead to incorrect or undefined behavior if not all points have unique associated values.
