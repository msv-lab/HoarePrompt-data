The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it processes input that consists of:

1. An integer `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`.
2. `n` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` such that `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000`, representing points in a set where if `(x, y)` is in the set, then all points `(x', y')` such that `0 ≤ x' ≤ x` and `0 ≤ y' ≤ y` are also in the set.
3. A line containing `n` integers `wi` such that `-100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000`, representing the required special values for the points in an aesthetically pleasing numbering.

Based on the input, the function processes the set of points and the corresponding special values `wi`.

The output depends on the processing of the input but is not specified in the given information. Given the lack of specific output details, we can only describe the accepted input.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n`, followed by `n` lines of pairs of integers `(x, y)` representing a set of points, and finally `n` integers `wi`.**
