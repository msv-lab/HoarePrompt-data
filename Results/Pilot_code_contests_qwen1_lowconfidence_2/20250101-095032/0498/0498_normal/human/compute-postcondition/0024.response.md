Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and for every key \(i\) in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order.**
