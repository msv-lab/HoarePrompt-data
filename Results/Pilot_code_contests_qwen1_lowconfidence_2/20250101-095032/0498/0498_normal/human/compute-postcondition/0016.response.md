The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further operations are performed, and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` must be a non-empty Counter object, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order. Additionally, the string 'NO' is printed to the console.**
