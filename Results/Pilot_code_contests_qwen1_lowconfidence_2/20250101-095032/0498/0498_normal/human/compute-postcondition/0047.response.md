Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is exactly equal to the length of `w`, `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, for every key `i` in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order and is now empty, `out` is a list containing all the string representations of the elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` in reverse order for each iteration, and `labels` contains the values updated during each iteration.**

Explanation:
1. **`n` is exactly equal to the length of `w`:** Since the loop runs for each element in `w`, `n` must be the length of `w`.

2. **`mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`:** The `Counter` object `mem` tracks the occurrences of elements in `w`, and since `w` is processed fully, `mem` remains unchanged.

3. **For every key `i` in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order and is now empty:** Each pair `[x, y]` is popped from `mem2[w[i]]` until it is empty. Since `mem2` is updated in each iteration, all lists within `mem2` become empty.

4. **`out` is a list containing all the string representations of the elements removed from `mem2[w[i]]` in reverse order for each iteration:** Each iteration appends the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[i]]` to `out`. As the elements are popped in reverse order of their appearance, the final `out` list will contain all these strings in reverse order.

5. **`labels` contains the values updated during each iteration:** The `labels` dictionary updates the values based on the conditions specified in the loop, ensuring that the constraints are maintained.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables is as described above.
