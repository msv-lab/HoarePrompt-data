The code initializes `mem` as a `Counter` object for the list `w`, `mem2` as a `defaultdict` of lists, and `out` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `wi` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000; `mem` is a Counter object for the list `w`; `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists; `out` is an empty list.**
