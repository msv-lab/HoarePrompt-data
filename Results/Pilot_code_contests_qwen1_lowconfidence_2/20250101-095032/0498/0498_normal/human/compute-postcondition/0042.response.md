`labels[x][y]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `i + 1` is 2. Since `labels[x][y]` was initially 2, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`mem2[w[1]]` is a list of elements sorted in descending order, `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` is 2.**
