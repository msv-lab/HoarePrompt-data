`mem2[y - x]` is appended with the list `[x, y]`. The initial value of `mem2[y - x]` could include `[x, y]` and possibly additional lists. After appending, the list `mem2[y - x]` will now contain at least the elements `[x, y]` and possibly additional lists.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object for the list `w`, `mem2[y - x]` includes the list `[x, y]` and possibly additional lists, `out` is an empty list**
