The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. The states of `mem2[w[1]]`, `out`, `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `labels[x][y]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mem2[w[1]]` is a list of elements sorted in descending order, `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` is 2.**
