Postcondition: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and for every key \(i\) in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, the first element of `mem2[w[0]]` is `[x, y]`, `labels[x][y]` is 1, and the condition `(i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y])` is true.**
