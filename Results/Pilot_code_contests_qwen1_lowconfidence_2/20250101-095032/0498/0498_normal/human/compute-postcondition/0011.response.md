The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further operations will be performed on any of the variables, and the program will stop executing. Since the program is terminated, none of the variables will be updated or their values changed.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, `mem2[k]` includes a list of all pairs `[x, y]` where \(y - x = k\) for each unique \(k\) encountered in the loop, `out` is an empty list, and `mem` must contain at least one item; the program has been terminated.**
