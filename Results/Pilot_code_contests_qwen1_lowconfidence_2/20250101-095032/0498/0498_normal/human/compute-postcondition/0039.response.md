The code snippet removes an element from the list `mem2[w[i]]` and appends the string representation of this element to the list `out`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `w[0]` is not involved in the operation since `i` is 1.
- We are dealing with `mem2[w[1]]`, which is sorted in descending order and does not contain `[x, y]`.
- `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.
- `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`.

Since `i` is 1, the operation will remove `x` (the last element) from `mem2[w[1]]` and append the string representation of `x` to `out`.

Let's denote the original list `mem2[w[1]]` as `[a1, a2, ..., x, y, ...]` where `x` is the last element and `y` is the second last element. After removing `x`, the list becomes `[a1, a2, ..., y, ...]`.

The string representation of `x` is `"x"`, so `out` will be updated to include `"x"`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `mem` is a non-empty Counter object for the list `w`, for every key `i` in `mem2`, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, `mem2[w[0]]` does not contain `[x, y]`, `out` contains the strings `"x y"` and `"x"`, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `mem2[w[1]]` before removal, `y` is the second last element of `mem2[w[1]]`, and `labels[x][y]` is 2.
