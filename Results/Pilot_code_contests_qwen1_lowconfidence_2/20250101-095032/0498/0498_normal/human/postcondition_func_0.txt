The function processes an integer \(n\), followed by \(n\) lines of pairs of integers \((x, y)\) representing a set of points, and finally \(n\) integers \(wi\). It verifies whether the points and their associated values can be arranged in a specific order according to the rules defined by the input. If the arrangement is possible, it outputs "YES" and prints the final configuration; otherwise, it prints "NO" and exits early. Specifically, the function checks that for each \(wi\), the corresponding \((x, y)\) pairs are correctly ordered and that no conflicts arise when assigning the values \(1\) to \(n\) to the points.
