#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The input consists of n lines, each containing two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000, representing points in a set where if (x, y) is in the set, then all points (x', y') such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y are also in the set. The next line contains n integers wi such that -100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000, representing the required special values for the points in an aesthetically pleasing numbering.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer \(n\), followed by \(n\) lines of pairs of integers \((x, y)\) representing a set of points, and finally \(n\) integers \(wi\). It verifies whether the points and their associated values can be arranged in a specific order according to the rules defined by the input. If the arrangement is possible, it outputs "YES" and prints the final configuration; otherwise, it prints "NO" and exits early. Specifically, the function checks that for each \(wi\), the corresponding \((x, y)\) pairs are correctly ordered and that no conflicts arise when assigning the values \(1\) to \(n\) to the points.
