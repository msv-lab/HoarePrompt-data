n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The following n lines contain pairs of integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000, representing the coordinates of points in the set, and all points are distinct. The next line contains n integers wi such that -100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000, representing the required special values for each point in the aesthetically pleasing numbering.
