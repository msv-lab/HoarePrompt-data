`V` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping each element from the input (which is split into a list of strings) to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial state of `N` is an input string with a length between 2 and 100, and `W` is a list of `N` integers each between 1 and 100. After executing the code, `N` will be updated to the length of the input list, and `W` will be replaced by the list `V` which contains integers converted from the input.

Since the exact input is not specified, the output state will depend on the specific input provided. However, the general structure of the output state will be:

- `N` is updated to the length of the input list (an integer).
- `W` is now equal to `V`, which is a list of integers converted from the input.

Output State: **`N` is the length of the input list; `W` is equal to `V`, a list of integers converted from the input.**
