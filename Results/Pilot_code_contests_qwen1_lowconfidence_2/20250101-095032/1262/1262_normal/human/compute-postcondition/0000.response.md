`N` is assigned the value `input()`, which will be a string representation of an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The initial list `W` is not affected by this code snippet, so its elements remain as initially defined. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100, and `W` is a list of `N` integers such that 1 <= `W_i` <= 100 for all i in range(`N`); `N` is now an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an input string, 2 <= N <= 100; `W` is a list of `N` integers such that 1 <= `W_i` <= 100 for all i in range(`N`).**
