Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - \(i\) is 2.
   - \(diff\) is \( \left| \sum(V[:2]) - \sum(V[2:]) \right| \).
   - \(len(V)\) must be at least 2.
   - \(W\) is equal to \(V\).
   - \(M\) is equal to \(diff\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from \(i = 1\) to \(len(V) - 1\). Since \(i\) is currently 2, the loop will increment \(i\) to 3.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the start of the loop, \(i\) is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, \(i\) must be incremented by 1, making \(i\) equal to 3.
   - \(W\) remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and there is no modification to \(W\).
   - \(M\) remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and there is no modification to \(M\).
   - \(len(V)\) remains unchanged because the length of \(V\) does not change within the loop.
   - \(diff\) might change if the loop body modifies it, but since the body is omitted, \(diff\) remains the same.

4. **Updated States:**
   - \(i\) is now 3.
   - \(diff\) remains \( \left| \sum(V[:2]) - \sum(V[2:]) \right| \).
   - \(len(V)\) remains at least 2.
   - \(W\) remains equal to \(V\).
   - \(M\) remains equal to \(diff\).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:

State: **`i` is 3, `diff` is \( \left| \sum(V[:2]) - \sum(V[2:]) \right| \), `len(V)` must be at least 2, `W` is equal to `V`, `M` is equal to `diff`.**
