The code assigns the value `1000000000.0` to the variable `M`. This assignment does not affect the values of `N` or `W`. Therefore, the value of `M` is now `1000000000.0`, while `N` and `W` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`N` is the length of the input list, `W` is equal to `V`, a list of integers converted from the input, `M` is 1000000000.0**
