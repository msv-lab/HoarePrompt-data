Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of the list `V` (exclusive of the upper bound). This means the loop will start from `i = 1` and continue until `i` is less than the length of `V`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be set to 1 initially.

3. **Check the Length of `V`**: Since the loop runs as long as `i < len(V)`, `len(V)` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at all (since it starts at `i = 1`).

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`N`, `W`, and `M`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `len(V)` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`i` is 1, `len(V)` must be at least 2, `N` is the length of the input list, `W` is equal to `V`, `M` is 1000000000.0**
