Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `diff` is \(\left| V[0] - \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} V[j] \right|\)
   - `len(V)` must be at least 2
   - `N` is the length of the input list `V`
   - `W` is equal to `V`
   - `M` is equal to `diff`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(V)`. Therefore, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `len(V)`.

3. **Incrementing `i`:**
   At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So, initially, `i` is 1. After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(V)`. Since `i` is initially 1 and it is incremented by 1, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2. This means `len(V)` must be at least 2 (which is already given).

5. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - `diff` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `W` remains equal to `V`.
   - `M` remains equal to `diff`.

6. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `diff` remains the same.
   - `len(V)` must still be at least 2.
   - `N` remains the same.
   - `W` remains equal to `V`.
   - `M` remains equal to `diff`.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `diff` is \(\left| V[0] - \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} V[j] \right|\), `len(V)` must be at least 2, `N` is the length of the input list `V`, `W` is equal to `V`, `M` is equal to `diff`.**
