Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `diff` is \(\left| V[0] - \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} V[j] \right|\), `len(V)` must be at least 2, `N` is the length of the input list `V`, `W` is equal to `V`, `M` is equal to `diff`. If `M > diff`, the value of `diff` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not apply as there is no else part specified.***
