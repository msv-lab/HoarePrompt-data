The initial state is defined as follows:
- `i` is 3
- `diff` is `abs(sum(V[:3]) - sum(V[3:]))`
- `len(V)` must be at least 2
- `W` is equal to `V`
- `M` is equal to `abs(sum(V[:3]) - sum(V[3:]))`

The code snippet is:
```python
M = diff
```

Step-by-step analysis:
- `M` is initially equal to `abs(sum(V[:3]) - sum(V[3:]))`, which is the same as `diff`.
- The code simply assigns the value of `diff` to `M`. This does not change the value of `M` since `M` is already equal to `diff`.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the explicit reassignment of `M` to `diff`.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `diff` is `abs(sum(V[:3]) - sum(V[3:]))`; `len(V)` must be at least 2; `W` is equal to `V`; `M` is equal to `diff`**
