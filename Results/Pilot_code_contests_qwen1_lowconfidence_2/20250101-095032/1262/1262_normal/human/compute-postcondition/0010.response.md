The code `M = diff` simply assigns the value of `diff` to `M`. The initial value of `diff` is given as `|sum(V[:2]) - sum(V[2:])|`. Since this value does not change, `M` will take on the same value as `diff`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `diff` is |sum(V[:2]) - sum(V[2:])|; `len(V)` must be at least 2; `W` is equal to `V`; `M` is equal to `diff`**
