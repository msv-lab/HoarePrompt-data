The code `print(M)` simply prints the value of `M`, which does not change the value of `M` itself. The variables `N` and `W` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is the length of the input list `V`, `W` is equal to `V`, `M` is the minimum absolute difference between the sums of any two parts of the list `V` that split the list into two non-empty parts.**
