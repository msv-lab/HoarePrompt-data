Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not compute the minimum possible absolute difference for all possible divisions where one group contains weights with indices not greater than \(T\) and the other group contains weights with indices greater than \(T\). Instead, it computes the minimum absolute difference for all possible ways to split the list into two non-empty parts.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Problem Description vs. Program Logic:**
   - The problem description specifies that \(T\) can be any integer such that \(1 \leq T < N\), meaning there are \(N-1\) possible divisions (from \(T=1\) to \(T=N-1\)).
   - However, the program only considers splits where the first part is not empty and the second part is not empty, which means \(T\) ranges from 1 to \(N-1\). This is correct.
   - But, the program does not explicitly consider all possible values of \(T\). It just iterates over the indices of the list and computes the difference for each possible split, which is not exhaustive for all \(T\) values.

2. **Missing Consideration of All Possible \(T\):**
   - The program should iterate over all possible values of \(T\) from 1 to \(N-1\) and compute the absolute difference for each division.
   - The current implementation only iterates over the indices of the list, which does not guarantee that all possible divisions are considered.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

- According to the problem description, the possible divisions are:
  - \(T=1\): \(S_1 = 1\), \(S_2 = 2 + 3 = 5\)
  - \(T=2\): \(S_1 = 1 + 2 = 3\), \(S_2 = 3\)
  - \(T=3\): \(S_1 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\), \(S_2 = 0\)

- The minimum absolute difference is \(|3 - 3| = 0\).

However, the program only considers the splits where both parts are non-empty:
- \(T=1\): \(S_1 = 1\), \(S_2 = 2 + 3 = 5\)
- \(T=2\): \(S_1 = 1 + 2 = 3\), \(S_2 = 3\)

- The computed minimum absolute difference is \(|3 - 3| = 0\), which is correct for this specific example, but the program does not ensure it covers all cases as required by the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate over all possible values of \(T\) from 1 to \(N-1\) and compute the differences accordingly. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    for T in range(1, N):
        S1 = sum(V[:T])
        S2 = sum(V[T:])
        diff = abs(S1 - S2)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    
    print(min_diff)
```

This version correctly iterates over all possible values of \(T\) and ensures that all possible divisions are considered, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
