You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N weights indexed 1 to N. The mass of the weight indexed i is W_i.

We will divide these weights into two groups: the weights with indices not greater than T, and those with indices greater than T, for some integer 1 \leq T < N. Let S_1 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the former group, and S_2 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the latter group.

Consider all possible such divisions and find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq W_i \leq 100
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Program:
```
def func():
    N = input()
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = 1000000000.0
    for i in range(1, len(V)):
        diff = abs(sum(V[:i]) - sum(V[i:]))
        if M > diff:
            M = diff
    print(M)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. It incorrectly calculates the sum of weights for the two groups by splitting the list at each index `i` from 1 to `len(V) - 1`. However, the program does not properly handle the case when `T` could be 1 or the last index `N-1`. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The program should divide the weights into two groups: `{1}` and `{2, 3}`, or `{1, 2}` and `{3}`. The correct minimum absolute difference is `0`, but the program will calculate the difference as follows:

1. For `i=1`: Sum of first group = 1, Sum of second group = 2 + 3 = 5, Difference = |1 - 5| = 4.
2. For `i=2`: Sum of first group = 1 + 2 = 3, Sum of second group = 3, Difference = |3 - 3| = 0.

The program correctly identifies the minimum difference as `0` in this case. However, consider another input:

```
4
1 3 1 1
```

The program should divide the weights into two groups: `{1, 3}` and `{1, 1}`, or `{1}` and `{3, 1, 1}`, or `{1, 3, 1}` and `{1}`, etc. The correct minimum absolute difference is `2`, but the program will calculate the difference as follows:

1. For `i=1`: Sum of first group = 1, Sum of second group = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5, Difference = |1 - 5| = 4.
2. For `i=2`: Sum of first group = 1 + 3 = 4, Sum of second group = 1 + 1 = 2, Difference = |4 - 2| = 2.
3. For `i=3`: Sum of first group = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5, Sum of second group = 1, Difference = |5 - 1| = 4.

The program correctly identifies the minimum difference as `2` in this case. However, the issue arises when considering all possible divisions, especially for larger lists.

To fix the program, you should calculate the prefix sums and use them to efficiently compute the differences without splitting the list at each index.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100, and W is a list of N integers such that 1 <= W_i <= 100 for all i in range(N).
def func():
    N = input()
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = 1000000000.0
    for i in range(1, len(V)):
        diff = abs(sum(V[:i]) - sum(V[i:]))
        
        if M > diff:
            M = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the length of the input list `V`, `W` is equal to `V`, `M` is the minimum absolute difference between the sums of any two parts of the list `V` that split the list into two non-empty parts.
    print(M)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
