Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `N` and a list `V` of `N` integers from standard input.
   - The constraints for `N` and the elements of `V` are respected, as the program processes these inputs within the specified ranges.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program iterates through the list `V` to calculate the minimum absolute difference between the sums of any two parts of the list `V` that split the list into two non-empty parts.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `N-1`, the program computes the absolute difference between the sum of the elements before `i` and the sum of the elements after `i`.
   - It keeps track of the minimum difference encountered during this process.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum absolute difference found.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- The program accurately follows the steps outlined in the problem description. It calculates the minimum absolute difference between the sums of the two groups divided at each possible index `T`.
- The logic inside the loop ensures that all possible splits are considered, and the minimum difference is tracked and printed.
- The program handles the constraints and input format as specified, assuming valid input as per the instructions.

Since the program meets the requirements and correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement, the correctness is **True**.
