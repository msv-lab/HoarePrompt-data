Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. It incorrectly calculates the sum of weights for the two groups by splitting the list at each index `i` from 1 to `len(V) - 1`. However, the program does not properly handle the case when `T` could be 1 or the last index `N-1`. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The program should divide the weights into two groups: `{1}` and `{2, 3}`, or `{1, 2}` and `{3}`. The correct minimum absolute difference is `0`, but the program will calculate the difference as follows:

1. For `i=1`: Sum of first group = 1, Sum of second group = 2 + 3 = 5, Difference = |1 - 5| = 4.
2. For `i=2`: Sum of first group = 1 + 2 = 3, Sum of second group = 3, Difference = |3 - 3| = 0.

The program correctly identifies the minimum difference as `0` in this case. However, consider another input:

```
4
1 3 1 1
```

The program should divide the weights into two groups: `{1, 3}` and `{1, 1}`, or `{1}` and `{3, 1, 1}`, or `{1, 3, 1}` and `{1}`, etc. The correct minimum absolute difference is `2`, but the program will calculate the difference as follows:

1. For `i=1`: Sum of first group = 1, Sum of second group = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5, Difference = |1 - 5| = 4.
2. For `i=2`: Sum of first group = 1 + 3 = 4, Sum of second group = 1 + 1 = 2, Difference = |4 - 2| = 2.
3. For `i=3`: Sum of first group = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5, Sum of second group = 1, Difference = |5 - 1| = 4.

The program correctly identifies the minimum difference as `2` in this case. However, the issue arises when considering all possible divisions, especially for larger lists.

To fix the program, you should calculate the prefix sums and use them to efficiently compute the differences without splitting the list at each index.
