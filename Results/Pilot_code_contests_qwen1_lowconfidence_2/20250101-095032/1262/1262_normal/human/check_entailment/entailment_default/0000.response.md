Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `V` from standard input. It then iterates through the list, calculating the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements, and keeps track of the minimum difference found.

However, the problem requires dividing the weights into two groups based on an index `T`, not just considering all possible splits. The current implementation does not consider the division point `T` and instead considers all possible splits from the start of the list to each subsequent element.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to iterate through all possible values of `T` from 1 to `N-1`, calculate the sums `S_1` and `S_2` for each division, and keep track of the minimum absolute difference. The provided code does not do this, and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
