Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the variable `N` is read as a string and not converted to an integer, which means the length of the list `V` is being compared incorrectly. Additionally, the loop runs from `1` to `len(V) - 1`, which means it considers only the first `N-1` elements, not including the last element in the initial part of the split. This results in the program potentially missing the optimal split point.

To fix this, the code should convert `N` to an integer and ensure the loop correctly handles the split for all possible `T` values, including `T = N-1`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for T in range(1, N):
        S1 = sum(V[:T])
        S2 = sum(V[T:])
        diff = abs(S1 - S2)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    print(min_diff)

```

This corrected version ensures that all possible splits are considered and the minimum absolute difference is calculated correctly.
