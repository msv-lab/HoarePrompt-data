Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way the sum of the weights is calculated. The program calculates the sum of the weights up to index `i` and the sum of the weights after index `i`, but it fails to correctly handle the case when `T` is chosen such that it splits the weights into two groups with unequal lengths.

For example, consider the input:

```
4
1 3 1 1
```

The program should find the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\). The correct solution would be to consider all possible values of `T` from 1 to `N-1` and calculate the sums accordingly. However, the given program only considers the difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements without checking all possible divisions.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate over all possible values of `T` and calculate the sums for each division, then find the minimum absolute difference. Here's an example of how the corrected program could look:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(V)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    for T in range(1, N):
        S1 = sum(V[:T])
        S2 = total_sum - S1
        min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(S1 - S2))
    
    print(min_diff)
```

This corrected program iterates over all possible values of `T` and calculates the sums for each division, ensuring that it finds the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\).
