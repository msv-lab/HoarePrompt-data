You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!

The main character of this game has n different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer ai from 0 to 100. The higher the number ai is, the higher is the i-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values ​​of <image> for all i from 1 to n. The expression ⌊ x⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number x down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if a4 = 46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

Your task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.

Input

The first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ k ≤ 107) — the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.

The second line of the input contains a sequence of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai characterizes the level of the i-th skill of the character.

Output

The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using k or less improvement units.

Examples

Input

2 4
7 9


Output

2


Input

3 8
17 15 19


Output

5


Input

2 2
99 100


Output

20

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor + lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <image>.

In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <image>. 
Program:
```
def func():
    try:
        (n, k) = raw_input().split()
        (n, k) = (int(n), int(k))
        nums = raw_input().split()
        nums = [int(num) for num in nums]
        nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)
        stop = False
        while not stop:
            stop = True
            for i in range(0, n):
                if k == 0:
                    break
                if nums[i] == 100:
                    continue
                delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
                if k < delta:
                    break
                stop = False
                nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
                k = k - delta
        print(sum([num / 10 for num in nums]))
    except IOError:
        pass


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum total rating of the character. Specifically, the program uses a sorting mechanism based on the last digit of the skills' levels, but this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 8
17 15 19
```

The correct approach would be to prioritize increasing skills that are closer to 100, as these will provide the most significant increase in the total rating. However, the current implementation sorts based on the last digit, which is not optimal. Instead, the correct approach involves prioritizing skills that are closest to 100 but below 100, and then increasing them to the nearest multiple of 10.

To fix this, we need to implement a strategy that prioritizes increasing skills to the nearest multiple of 10, starting from the largest skill value that is less than 100. This ensures that the highest possible value is achieved for the total rating.

Here is a revised version of the function that implements the correct logic:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to get the next multiple of 10
    def next_multiple_of_10(x):
        return ((x + 9) // 10) * 10
    
    total_rating = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_skill = nums[i]
        if current_skill < 100:
            needed_improvement = min(10 - (current_skill % 10), k)
            nums[i] += needed_improvement
            k -= needed_improvement
    
    for skill in nums:
        total_rating += skill // 10
    
    print(total_rating)
```

This corrected version ensures that the skills are increased to the nearest multiple of 10, starting from the largest skill that is less than 100, thereby maximizing the total rating.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7. The list ai is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100.
def func():
    try:
        n, k = raw_input().split()
        n, k = int(n), int(k)
        nums = raw_input().split()
        nums = [int(num) for num in nums]
        nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)
        stop = False
        while not stop:
            stop = True
            
            for i in range(0, n):
                if k == 0:
                    break
                if nums[i] == 100:
                    continue
                delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
                if k < delta:
                    break
                stop = False
                nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
                k = k - delta
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have executed.
        #
        #### Initial State:
        #- `n` is a non-negative integer.
        #- `k` is an integer.
        #- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
        #- `stop` is `False`.
        #
        #### Loop Analysis:
        #The loop continues as long as `stop` is `False`. Inside the loop, there is a `for` loop that iterates from `0` to `n-1`. For each iteration of the `for` loop, the following steps are performed:
        #1. Check if `k` is 0. If so, break out of the loop.
        #2. Skip the iteration if `nums[i]` is 100.
        #3. Calculate `delta` as `10 - (nums[i] % 10)`.
        #4. If `k` is less than `delta`, break out of the loop.
        #5. Update `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + delta` and decrease `k` by `delta`.
        #6. Set `stop` to `False`.
        #
        #### After Loop Executes 1 Time:
        #- `n` is a non-negative integer.
        #- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
        #- `stop` is `True`.
        #- `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke.
        #- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.
        #
        #### After Loop Executes 2 Times:
        #- `n` is a non-negative integer.
        #- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
        #- `stop` is `False` if the loop broke due to `k` being less than `delta` or `nums[i]` being 100.
        #- `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke.
        #- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.
        #
        #### General Pattern:
        #- The loop continues until either `k` becomes 0 or the loop breaks due to reaching the end of the list or encountering a 100.
        #- If `k` becomes 0, the loop stops, and `stop` becomes `True`.
        #- If the loop breaks due to `k` being less than `delta` or `nums[i]` being 100, `stop` remains `False` and `i` will be the index where the loop broke.
        #- Elements in `nums` that were not 100 and were within the loop's range are updated according to the calculation `nums[i] + delta`.
        #
        #### Final Output State:
        #- If `k` becomes 0, `stop` is `True`, and all elements in `nums` that were not 100 and within the loop's range are updated.
        #- If `k` does not become 0, `stop` remains `False`, and the loop may have broken due to `k` being less than `delta` or encountering a 100.
        #
        #Thus, the final output state is:
        #
        #**Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `stop` is `True` if `k` became 0, otherwise `stop` is `False`, `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.**
        print(sum([(num / 10) for num in nums]))
    except (IOError):
        pass
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: - If the `IOError` occurs, the program passes through the except block without changing the state of the variables.
    #   - If no exception occurs, the final state includes:
    #     - `n` and `k` as positive integers within the specified ranges.
    #     - `stop` as a boolean indicating whether the loop terminated because `k` became 0.
    #     - `i` as an index that represents where the loop broke or the value of `n` if the loop completed normally.
    #     - `nums` as a list of integers sorted in descending order based on their last digit, with some elements possibly updated.
    #     - The program prints the sum of the quotients when each number in `nums` is divided by 10.
    #
    #### Example Answer:
    #A `IOError` might be triggered if there is an issue reading input from the standard input. If the input is correctly read and processed, the program sorts the list `nums` based on the last digit of each integer and updates some elements to make them multiples of 10, up to the limit of `k`. After processing, it prints the sum of the quotients when each number in `nums` is divided by 10. If an `IOError` occurs, the state remains unchanged.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state is:
    #Output State:
