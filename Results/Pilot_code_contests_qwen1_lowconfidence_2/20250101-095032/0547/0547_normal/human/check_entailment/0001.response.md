Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where a skill value is already at 100. According to the problem description, once a skill reaches 100, no further improvement units can be used on that skill. However, the program attempts to increment skills that are already at 100, which is not allowed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
99 100
```

The program should only increase the first skill to 100 (using 1 improvement unit), and leave the second skill unchanged since it is already at 100. The total rating should be:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \right\rfloor = 10 + 10 = 20 \]

However, the program incorrectly tries to increment the second skill as well, leading to an incorrect total rating calculation. This can be verified by running the program with the given input and observing the output.
