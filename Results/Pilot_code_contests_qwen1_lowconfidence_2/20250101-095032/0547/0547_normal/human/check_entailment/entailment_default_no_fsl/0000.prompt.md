You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!

The main character of this game has n different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer ai from 0 to 100. The higher the number ai is, the higher is the i-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values ​​of <image> for all i from 1 to n. The expression ⌊ x⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number x down to the nearest integer.

At the beginning of the game Petya got k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if a4 = 46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.

Your task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.

Input

The first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ k ≤ 107) — the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.

The second line of the input contains a sequence of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai characterizes the level of the i-th skill of the character.

Output

The first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using k or less improvement units.

99 100


Output

20

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor + lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20.

In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <image>.

In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <image>. 
Program:
```
def func():
    try:
        (n, k) = raw_input().split()
        (n, k) = (int(n), int(k))
        nums = raw_input().split()
        nums = [int(num) for num in nums]
        nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)
        stop = False
        while not stop:
            stop = True
            for i in range(0, n):
                if k == 0:
                    break
                if nums[i] == 100:
                    continue
                delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
                if k < delta:
                    break
                stop = False
                nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
                k = k - delta
        print(sum([num / 10 for num in nums]))
    except IOError:
        pass


```
Output hints: The function processes a list of integers `nums` (of length `n`) and an integer `k`. It sorts the list in descending order based on the last digit of each integer. Then, it iteratively increases the last digit of each element in `nums` to the nearest multiple of 10 (if possible) using up to `k` units of "change". The process stops when `k` is depleted, the end of the list is reached, or all elements in the list are already multiples of 10. Finally, it prints the sum of the quotients when each number in the updated list is divided by 10. If an `IOError` occurs during input reading, the function handles it gracefully without changing the state of the variables.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
