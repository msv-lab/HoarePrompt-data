Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `delta` is undefined. If `nums[0]` is equal to 100, then `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` remains 0.***
