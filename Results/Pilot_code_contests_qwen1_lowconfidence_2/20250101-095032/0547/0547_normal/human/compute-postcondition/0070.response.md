`nums[i]` is assigned the value of `nums[i] + delta`. Given that `nums[i]` is the original value before adding `delta`, and `delta` is a value such that `k < delta`, the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is met. Therefore, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but the value of `nums[i]` is updated.

The Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `k` is 0 - delta; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `False`; `i` is either 1 or 2; `nums[i]` is the original value plus `delta`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
