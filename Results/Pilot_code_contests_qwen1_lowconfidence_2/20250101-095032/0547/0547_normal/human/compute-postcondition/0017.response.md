The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified to be exited here, and no variables are modified, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `True`; `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`; the `break` statement is executed.**
