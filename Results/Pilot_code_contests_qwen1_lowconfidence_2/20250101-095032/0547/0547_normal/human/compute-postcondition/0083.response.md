To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step based on its logic and the given output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Logic Analysis:
- The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if `k` is `0`, the loop breaks immediately.
- If `nums[i]` is `100`, the loop skips to the next iteration.
- Otherwise, `delta` is calculated as `10 - nums[i] % 10`.
- If `k` is less than `delta`, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `stop` is set to `False`, `nums[i]` is incremented by `delta`, and `k` is decreased by `delta`.

### Key Observations:
- The loop will only run until `k` becomes `0` or less, or until it reaches the end of the list.
- If `nums[i]` becomes `100`, it will be skipped.
- Each time the loop increments `nums[i]`, `k` decreases by `delta`.
- Once `k` becomes `0`, the loop will break.

### Final State Analysis:
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is `0`), `k` remains `0`, `stop` remains `True`, and `i` is `n` (`0`).
- If the loop executes and completes all iterations without breaking, `k` will become `0`, `stop` will be `False`, and `i` will be `n`.
- If the loop breaks due to `k` becoming `0` before completing all iterations, `k` will be a non-positive integer, `stop` will be `False`, and `i` will be the index where the loop broke.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions hold:
- `k` will be `0` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it will be a non-positive integer.
- `stop` will be `False` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it will be `False`.
- `i` will be `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it will be the index where the loop broke.
- `nums` will be updated such that each element that was not `100` will be incremented by `delta` corresponding to its last digit, up to the point where `k` becomes `0`.

### Output State:
**Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `stop` is False, `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`.**
