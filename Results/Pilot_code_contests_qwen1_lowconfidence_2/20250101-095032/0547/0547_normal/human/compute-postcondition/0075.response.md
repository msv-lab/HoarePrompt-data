The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables and simply skips to the next iteration, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - 2*delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `nums[3]` is the original value plus `delta`**
