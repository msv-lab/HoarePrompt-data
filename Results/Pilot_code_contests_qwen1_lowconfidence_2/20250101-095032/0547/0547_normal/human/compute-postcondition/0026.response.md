Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `-delta`; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `False`; `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10` where `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. Since the if condition `nums[i] == 100` is not met (as it would terminate the if part with the same precondition), the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
