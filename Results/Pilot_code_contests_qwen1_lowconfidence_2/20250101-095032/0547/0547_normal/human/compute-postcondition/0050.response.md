Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`, `i` is 0, and `delta` is undefined. Since the if condition `k == 0` is met, all the variables retain their initial states as specified in the precondition.***
