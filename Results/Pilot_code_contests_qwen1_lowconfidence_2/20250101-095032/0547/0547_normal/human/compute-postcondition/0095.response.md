The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead exits the loop or block it is within. Since there is no loop or block context provided, the variables retain their initial states. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stop` is `True`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`. We break out of the most internal loop or block.**
