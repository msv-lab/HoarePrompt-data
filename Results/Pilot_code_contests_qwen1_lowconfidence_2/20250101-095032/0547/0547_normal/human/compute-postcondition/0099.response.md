`k` is assigned the value `k - delta`. Given that `delta` is `10 - original_num % 10`, we can substitute this into the equation. Since `original_num` is such that `nums[0] = original_num + (10 - original_num % 10)`, it means `original_num % 10` is the last digit of `original_num`. Thus, `delta` is `10 - original_num % 10`, which simplifies the expression to `k = k - (10 - original_num % 10)`. 

Since the initial state includes `k` being 0 or a non-positive integer, and `delta` is derived from `original_num`, the value of `k` after the operation will be `k - (10 - original_num % 10)`, which is still a non-positive integer given that `k` was initially non-positive.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - `(10 - original_num % 10)`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num % 10), `delta` is `10 - original_num % 10`.**
