The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no explicit loop context given, and the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables outside of a loop body. Given the initial state and the fact that no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement itself, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `-2 * delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n`. If `k == 0`, the state remains unchanged.**
