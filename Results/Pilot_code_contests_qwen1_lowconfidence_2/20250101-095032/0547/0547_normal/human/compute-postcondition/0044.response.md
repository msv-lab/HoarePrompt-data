Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n`, `delta` is undefined.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `k > 0` and `i < n` and `nums[i] != 100`.

2. **Break Condition**:
   - The loop breaks when `k <= 0` or `nums[i] == 100`.

3. **Continue Condition**:
   - The loop continues to the next iteration without any change if `nums[i] == 100`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - For each valid `i`, the loop calculates `delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10`.
   - If `k < delta`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`, `k` is reduced by `delta`, and `stop` is set to `False`.

5. **Final State Analysis**:
   - If the loop does not execute even once, `stop` remains `True`, `k` remains its original value, and `i` remains 0.
   - If the loop executes but does not complete all iterations, `k` will be reduced to a non-positive value, and `stop` will be `False`.
   - If the loop completes all iterations, `k` will be reduced to 0, and `stop` will be `False`.

Given these points, the final state of the variables after the loop finishes executing is:

- `n` remains as it was initially.
- `k` becomes 0.
- `nums` remains unchanged as the loop only updates elements when `k > 0` and `nums[i] != 100`.
- `stop` becomes `False` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise, it remains `True`.
- `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n` or the loop condition fails.
- `delta` is no longer defined after the loop ends since the loop itself does not store this value.

Thus, the output state is determined by the conditions and actions described above.
