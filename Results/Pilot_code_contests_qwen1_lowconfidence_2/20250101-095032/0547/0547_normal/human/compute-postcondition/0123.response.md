Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
- `stop` is `False`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop continues as long as `stop` is `False`. Inside the loop, there is a `for` loop that iterates from `0` to `n-1`. For each iteration of the `for` loop, the following steps are performed:
1. Check if `k` is 0. If so, break out of the loop.
2. Skip the iteration if `nums[i]` is 100.
3. Calculate `delta` as `10 - (nums[i] % 10)`.
4. If `k` is less than `delta`, break out of the loop.
5. Update `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + delta` and decrease `k` by `delta`.
6. Set `stop` to `False`.

### After Loop Executes 1 Time:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
- `stop` is `True`.
- `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.

### After Loop Executes 2 Times:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
- `stop` is `False` if the loop broke due to `k` being less than `delta` or `nums[i]` being 100.
- `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.

### General Pattern:
- The loop continues until either `k` becomes 0 or the loop breaks due to reaching the end of the list or encountering a 100.
- If `k` becomes 0, the loop stops, and `stop` becomes `True`.
- If the loop breaks due to `k` being less than `delta` or `nums[i]` being 100, `stop` remains `False` and `i` will be the index where the loop broke.
- Elements in `nums` that were not 100 and were within the loop's range are updated according to the calculation `nums[i] + delta`.

### Final Output State:
- If `k` becomes 0, `stop` is `True`, and all elements in `nums` that were not 100 and within the loop's range are updated.
- If `k` does not become 0, `stop` remains `False`, and the loop may have broken due to `k` being less than `delta` or encountering a 100.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `stop` is `True` if `k` became 0, otherwise `stop` is `False`, `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.**
