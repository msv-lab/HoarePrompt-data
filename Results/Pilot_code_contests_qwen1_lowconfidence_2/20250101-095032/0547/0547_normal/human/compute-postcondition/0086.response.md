Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
   - `stop` is `True`.
   - `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke (if the loop has already broken).
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
   - Each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not run at all.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop requires `n` to be greater than 0, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0.
   - `i` should be set to `0` as it is the starting point of the loop.
   - `stop` being `True` is fine as it does not affect the loop's execution condition.
   - `k` being 0 or a non-positive integer does not affect the loop execution.
   - `nums` should be a valid list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer. However, since we are only concerned with the initial state to allow the loop to execute, this remains unchanged.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` should be 0 to start the loop.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stop` is `True`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`**.
