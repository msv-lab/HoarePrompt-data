Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `stop` is `False`, `k` is `k - delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num % 10)`, `nums[1]` is `second_element + (10 - second_element % 10)`, and if `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
