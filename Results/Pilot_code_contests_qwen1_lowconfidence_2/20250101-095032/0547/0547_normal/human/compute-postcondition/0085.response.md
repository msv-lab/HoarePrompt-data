`stop` is assigned the value `True`. This means the `stop` variable is now `True`, and the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`.
