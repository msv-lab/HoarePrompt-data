`nums[i]` is assigned the value of `nums[i] + delta`. Given that `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, the value of `nums[i]` is increased by `delta`. Since `nums` is initially sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, this operation does not affect the overall sorting property of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `False`, and `nums[i]` is `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`**
