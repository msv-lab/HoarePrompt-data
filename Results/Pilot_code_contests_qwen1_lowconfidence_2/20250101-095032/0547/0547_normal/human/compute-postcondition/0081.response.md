`nums[i]` is assigned the value of `nums[i] + delta`. Since `i` is 3, this modifies `nums[3]`. The value of `delta` is `10 - last digit of nums[3]`, and `nums[3]` is its original value plus `delta`. Thus, the new value of `nums[3]` becomes its original value plus `delta`, which further simplifies to the original value of `nums[3]` plus `10 - last digit of nums[3]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - 2*delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, and `nums[3]` is the original value of `nums[3]` plus `10 - last digit of nums[3]`.
