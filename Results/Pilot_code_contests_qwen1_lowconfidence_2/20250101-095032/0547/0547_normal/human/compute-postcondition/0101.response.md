The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the current loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Given that there is no loop or conditional statement context in the provided code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `delta` is \(10 - original_num \% 10\)**.
