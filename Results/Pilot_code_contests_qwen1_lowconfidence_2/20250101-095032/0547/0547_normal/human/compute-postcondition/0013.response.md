The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the code snippet, we assume this is inside a loop context implied by the initial state. Given the initial state and the impact of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables are not altered, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and `stop` is `True`. The current value of `nums[i]` is 100, and the loop continues with the next iteration.**
