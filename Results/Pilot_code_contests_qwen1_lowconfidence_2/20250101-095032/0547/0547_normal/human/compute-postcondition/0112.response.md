The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement present in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the hypothetical context where such a statement would be placed. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `stop` is `False`, `k` is `k - delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num % 10)`, `nums[1] is second_element + (10 - second_element % 10)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
