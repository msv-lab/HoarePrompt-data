The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the `if` condition was true and caused `k` to remain unchanged, the `continue` statement will simply move to the next iteration of the loop without changing any other variables. Therefore, the output state will maintain the same values as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `delta` is \(10 - original_num \% 10\)**
