The code `break` is executed, which does not affect any variable values but indicates breaking out of the nearest loop or conditional statement. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `i` is either 1 or 2, `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta**
