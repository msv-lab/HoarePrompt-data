Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and `stop` is `True`. After the if-else block executes, if `nums[i]` equals 100, the loop continues with the next iteration; otherwise, no change occurs since there is no action specified in the else part.***
