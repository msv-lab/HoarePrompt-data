The code sorts the list `nums` using a custom comparator that sorts the numbers in descending order based on their last digit. This means that for any two numbers `a` and `b`, they will be sorted such that the number with the larger last digit comes first.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `nums` is a list of integers, the sorting operation modifies the `nums` list. After sorting, the `nums` list will contain the same integers as before but in a different order, specifically sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer**
