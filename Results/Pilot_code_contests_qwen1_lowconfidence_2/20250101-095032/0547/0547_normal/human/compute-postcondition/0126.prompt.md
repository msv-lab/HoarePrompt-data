You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for summarizing the state of the function after executing a Python `try` statement. You will be provided with the final state of the program after executing the `try` block, and the changes in the program after executing one or more `except` blocks in any situation. Please combine this information to summarize the program's state after the complete execution of the `try` statement. If there is a return always include it in the output sate. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example 1:

Initial State: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    result = a / b
    return result
except ZeroDivisionError:
    return None
```
Ouput state after the execution of the try statement: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `result` is the result of `a` divided by `b`, and the function returns `result`.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): The function returns None if a ZeroDivisionError occurs.

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 1:
A `ZeroDivisionError` might be triggered at `result = a / b`. If `b` is 0, the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise, the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `b` is zero, the function returns `None`, otherwise the function returns the value of `a` divided by `b`.**

Example 2:

Program state after fully executing the `try` block:
Initial State: file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file.

Code for the try except block:
```
def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
            print("File content successfully read.")
            return data

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path.")
        return None

    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: You do not have permission to read this file.")
        return None
```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `file_path` is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file, data is the contents of that file and the function returns that content.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s):
Except statement 1:The function return None and prints "Error: The file was not found. Please check the file path." 
Except statement 2: The function return None and prints "Error: You do not have permission to read this file."

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.


Example Answer 2 :
The program could raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the file is not found at the specified path or a `PermissionError` if the user does not have permission to read the file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function reads the file content and returns it. 
Therefore: Output State: **file_path is a string that's supposed to be a path to a file. If the file is found and the user has permission, the function returns the file content, otherwise, it prints an error message and returns None.**


Your Task:

Initial State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^7. The list ai is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100.
Code for the try except block:
```
try:
    n, k = raw_input().split()
    n, k = int(n), int(k)
    nums = raw_input().split()
    nums = [int(num) for num in nums]
    nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)
    stop = False
    while not stop:
        stop = True
        for i in range(0, n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            if nums[i] == 100:
                continue
            delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
            if k < delta:
                break
            stop = False
            nums[i] = nums[i] + delta
            k = k - delta
    print(sum([(num / 10) for num in nums]))
except IOError:
    pass

```
Output state after the execution of the try statement: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `stop` is `True` if `k` became 0, otherwise `stop` is `False`, `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated, and the sum of the quotients when each number in `nums` is divided by 10 is printed.
Output state after the execution of the except statement(s): 
except_1: the state is unknown

Now, please think step by step: At which point in the program could such an exception occur? Summarise what the try except statement accomplishes and what the program output state is after it is executed.
