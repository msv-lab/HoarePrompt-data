`n, k` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`. This means `n` and `k` are now strings. However, since they were initially positive integers, they will be converted to integers in the next steps if used accordingly. For now, we keep them as strings until further operations.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string**
