The code `continue` is used within a loop (implied by the context of `i` being incremented) to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, the code snippet itself does not change any variable values or provide new information about the state of the program. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the implicit movement to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state, the only change is the implied increment of `i` because of the `continue` statement. Since `nums[i]` was initially 100, moving to the next iteration will imply that `i` is now 1, and `nums[i]` would be the next element in the list, which is also 100 since the list is sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`, `i` is 1, and `delta` is undefined.**
