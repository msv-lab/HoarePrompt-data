Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `-delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `False`, and `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10` where `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. If `k < delta`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the precondition when the if condition is not met.***
