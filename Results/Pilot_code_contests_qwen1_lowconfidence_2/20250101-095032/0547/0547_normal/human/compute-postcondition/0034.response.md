The code `break` does not modify any variables. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or match/case block. Since there is no loop or match/case block in the given code snippet, the execution of the code does not change any of the variables. The state of the variables remains as it was before.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `-2 * delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n`.**
