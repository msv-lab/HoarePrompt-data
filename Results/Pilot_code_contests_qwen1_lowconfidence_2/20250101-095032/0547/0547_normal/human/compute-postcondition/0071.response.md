`k` is assigned the value of `k - delta`. The initial value of `k` is "0 - delta", so after subtracting `delta`, `k` becomes `-2*delta`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `k` is 0 - 2*delta; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `False`; `i` is either 1 or 2; `nums[i]` is the original value plus `delta`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
