Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `-2 * (10 - last_digit)`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n`, where `delta` is `10 - last_digit`. If `k < delta`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition within the if block.***
