Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stop` is `True`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`. If `k < delta`, we break out of the most internal loop or block. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when `k >= delta`.***
