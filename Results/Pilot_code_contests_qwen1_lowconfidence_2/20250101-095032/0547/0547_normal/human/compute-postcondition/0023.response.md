The `break` statement is executed without changing any variable values. The `stop` variable is set to `True` when a `break` is encountered in many loops, but since no loop was specified to be exited, we assume the `break` does not affect `stop`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `-delta`; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `False`; `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10` where `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
