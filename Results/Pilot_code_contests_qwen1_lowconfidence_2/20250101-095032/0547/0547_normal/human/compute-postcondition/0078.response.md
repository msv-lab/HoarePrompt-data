The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement directly containing this `break` statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. However, since no such block is specified, we assume the `break` statement is effectively outside of any such control structure.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0
- `k` is 0 - 2*delta
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer
- `stop` is False
- `nums[3]` is the original value plus `delta`
- `delta` is 10 - last digit of `nums[3]`

Since the `break` statement does not affect the values of these variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - 2*delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `nums[3]` is the original value plus `delta`, `delta` is 10 - last digit of `nums[3]`.**
