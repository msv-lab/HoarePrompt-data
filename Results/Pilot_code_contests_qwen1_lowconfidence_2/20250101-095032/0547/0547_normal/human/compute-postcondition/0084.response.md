To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues. The loop continues as long as `stop` is `False`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer
- `stop` is `False`
- `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`

For the loop to continue, `stop` must remain `False`. Since no other condition directly influences the continuation of the loop except `stop`, there is no need to adjust any other state variable for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, the state does not need to be modified beyond ensuring `stop` remains `False`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `stop` is False, `i` is `n` or the index where the loop broke, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`**
