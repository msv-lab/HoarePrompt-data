Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `delta` is either 10 if `nums[0]` is 100 and `i` is 0, otherwise `delta` is `10 - last_digit_of_nums0` if `i` is 0 and `nums[0]` is not 100, otherwise `delta` is `10 - last_digit_of_nums1` if `i` is 1, and `k` is less than `delta`**
