Let's break down the given scenario step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
   - `stop` is `True`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `delta` is undefined.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop condition is `for i in range(0, n)`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must iterate through the range from 0 to `n-1`. This means that initially, `i` should be 0 and then increment up to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, the first value of `i` will be `n`, and the loop will not execute because the range function does not include the upper limit `n`.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` must start at 0 and not at `n`.
   - Additionally, since `i` is initialized to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0 to allow at least one iteration of the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 0.

Given these points, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`, `i` is 0, `delta` is undefined**.
