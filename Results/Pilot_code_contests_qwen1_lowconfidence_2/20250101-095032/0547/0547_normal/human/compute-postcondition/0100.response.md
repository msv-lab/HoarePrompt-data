Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State Recap
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `stop` is `False`.
- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\).
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
- `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`.
- `delta` is \(10 - original_num \% 10\).

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `stop` remains `False` unless some condition inside the loop changes it.
   - `k` remains a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\).
   - `nums` remains a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit.
   - `nums[0]` remains `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`.
   - `delta` remains \(10 - original_num \% 10\).

### Final State
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `stop` is `False`.
- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\).
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
- `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`.
- `delta` is \(10 - original_num \% 10\).

### Output State
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `delta` is \(10 - original_num \% 10\).**
