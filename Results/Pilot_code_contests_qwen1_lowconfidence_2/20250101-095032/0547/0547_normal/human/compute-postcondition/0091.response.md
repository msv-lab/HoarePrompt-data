The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no explicit loop in the given code snippet, the variables are not affected by the `continue` statement, and the program simply moves to the next line of code after the current one. The conditions and values of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stop` is `True`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`. The current value of `nums[i]` is 100.**
