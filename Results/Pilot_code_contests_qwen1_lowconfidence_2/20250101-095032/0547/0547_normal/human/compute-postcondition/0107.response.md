Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `delta` is \(10 - \text{second\_element} \% 10\). If `k < delta`, the condition remains as is. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition evaluation.***
