Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stop` is `True`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer. Each element that was not 100 and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`. If `nums[i]` is 100, the current value remains unchanged.***
