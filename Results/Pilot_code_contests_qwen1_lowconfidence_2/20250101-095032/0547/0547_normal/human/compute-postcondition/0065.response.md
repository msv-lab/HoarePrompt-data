Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta` since the if condition `k == 0` is not met and the else part does not execute.***
