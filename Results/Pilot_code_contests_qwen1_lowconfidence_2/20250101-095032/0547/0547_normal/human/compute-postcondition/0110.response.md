`k` is assigned the value of `k - delta`. The value of `delta` is not specified in the initial state, but since `k` is updated, its new value is `k - delta`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is `k - delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `nums[1]` is `second_element + (10 - second_element \% 10)`**
