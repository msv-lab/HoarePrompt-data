The provided code calculates the sum of the quotients when each number in the list `nums` is divided by 10. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `stop`, or `i`. It only computes a new value and prints it. Since the print statement does not assign the result to a variable, the values of `n`, `k`, `stop`, and `i` remain unchanged.

### Updated Values:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
- `stop` is `True` if `k` became 0, otherwise `stop` is `False`.
- `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n`.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.

### Calculation:
The code calculates and prints the sum of the quotients when each number in the list `nums` is divided by 10. The sum is computed as follows:
\[ \text{sum} = \sum_{\text{num} \in \text{nums}} \left( \frac{\text{num}}{10} \right) \]

Since the exact values of `nums` are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical value for the sum. However, the list `nums` remains unchanged.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
- `stop` is `True` if `k` became 0, otherwise `stop` is `False`.
- `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n`.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated.
- The sum of the quotients when each number in `nums` is divided by 10 is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `stop` is `True` if `k` became 0, otherwise `stop` is `False`, `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated, and the sum of the quotients when each number in `nums` is divided by 10 is printed.**
