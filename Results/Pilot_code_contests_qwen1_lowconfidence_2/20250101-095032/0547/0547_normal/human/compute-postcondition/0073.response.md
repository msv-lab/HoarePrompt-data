The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified, and the `break` statement is not associated with any such construct in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - 2*delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `nums[3]` is the original value plus `delta`**
