The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block around the `break` statement, it simply exits the current context. No variables are modified by the `break` statement. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`.**
