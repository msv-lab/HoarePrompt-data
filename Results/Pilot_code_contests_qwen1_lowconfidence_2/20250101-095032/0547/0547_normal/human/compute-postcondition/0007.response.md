The code sets `stop` to `True`. This changes the value of `stop` from `False` to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `True`**
