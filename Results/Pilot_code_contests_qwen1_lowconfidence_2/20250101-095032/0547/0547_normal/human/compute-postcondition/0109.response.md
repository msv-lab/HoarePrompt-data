`nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + delta`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `delta` is \(10 - \text{second\_element} \% 10\). Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, the second element `nums[1]` would be the next largest number in this sorted list, which means `nums[1]` is the next largest number when ordered by its last digit.

Let's denote the second element of `nums` as `second_element`. According to the initial conditions, `delta` is calculated as \(10 - \text{second\_element} \% 10\).

After updating `nums[i]` (where `i` is 1), the new value of `nums[1]` becomes `second_element + delta`.

So, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `nums[1]` is `second_element + (10 - second_element \% 10)`**
