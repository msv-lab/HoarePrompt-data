The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement is inside an if-else block and the if condition `k == 0` is not met, the else part does not execute. The value of `k` remains unchanged, and the list `nums` and its elements are also not affected. The states of the other variables (`n`, `stop`, `i`) remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `i` is either 1 or 2**
