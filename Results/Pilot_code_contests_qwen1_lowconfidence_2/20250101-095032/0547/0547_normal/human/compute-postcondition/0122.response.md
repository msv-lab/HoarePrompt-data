To determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes, let's analyze the loop logic step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs through the list `nums` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`. For each iteration:
1. If `k` is `0`, the loop breaks immediately.
2. If the current element `nums[i]` is `100`, the loop continues to the next element.
3. Otherwise, it calculates `delta` as `10 - nums[i] % 10`.
4. If `k` is less than `delta`, the loop breaks.
5. Otherwise, it updates `nums[i]` by adding `delta` to its current value, sets `stop` to `False`, and decreases `k` by `delta`.

### Initial State Recap
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is `0` or a non-positive integer.
- `stop` is `True`.
- `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n` if the loop did not break.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
- Each element in `nums` that was not `100` and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + delta`.

### Key Observations
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to run as long as `k` is not `0` and the current element is not `100` and `k` is greater than or equal to `delta`.
2. **Update Logic**: For each valid element `nums[i]`, `k` is reduced by `delta`, and the element is updated by adding `delta`.

### Final State Analysis
- **Condition for Loop Completion**: The loop will continue until `k` becomes `0` or it reaches the end of the list without breaking due to `k < delta`.
- **Final Values**:
  - `i`: The loop will either reach the end of the list or break at some point, so `i` will be the index of the last element processed or `n` if no elements were processed.
  - `stop`: Will be `False` because the loop will only set it to `True` if the loop exits early (which it won't).
  - `k`: Will be `0` because the loop will reduce `k` by `delta` for each valid element processed until `k` becomes `0`.
  - `nums`: Each element that was not `100` and within the loop's range will have been incremented by `delta` multiple times, resulting in the final updated value.

### Output State
Given the analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop completes will be:
- `n` must be a non-negative integer.
- `i` will be the index of the last element processed by the loop or `n` if no elements were processed.
- `stop` will be `False`.
- `k` will be `0`.
- `nums` will be a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, where each element that was not `100` and within the loop's range has been incremented by `delta` multiple times.

**Output State:**
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the index of the last element processed by the loop or `n` if no elements were processed, `stop` is `False`, `k` is `0`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, each element that was not `100` and within the loop's range is updated to `original value + (10 - original value % 10) * (number of times it was processed).**
