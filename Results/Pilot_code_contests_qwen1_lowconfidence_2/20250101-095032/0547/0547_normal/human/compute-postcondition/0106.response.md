The code `break` does not affect any variable values but indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block mentioned in the given code, we assume this `break` statement is within a loop or conditional structure that was previously defined but is not shown here. However, since the code does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `delta` is \(10 - \text{second\_element} \% 10\)**
