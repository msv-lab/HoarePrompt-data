The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the current loop or condition. Since there is no loop or conditional statement that the `break` is directly associated with in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `-2 * (10 - last_digit)`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n`, where `delta` is `10 - last_digit`.**
