The code updates the value of `delta` to be `10 - nums[i] % 10`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer. `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num % 10)`, and `delta` is initially \(10 - original_num \% 10\).

Since `i` is 1, `nums[i]` refers to the second element in the list `nums`. Let's denote the first element of `nums` as `first_element` and the second element as `second_element`. According to the initial state, `first_element` is `original_num + (10 - original_num % 10)`.

The new value of `delta` is calculated as:
\[ \text{delta} = 10 - \text{second\_element} \% 10 \]

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `delta` is now \(10 - \text{second\_element} \% 10\)
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer - \((10 - original_num \% 10)\), `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `nums[0]` is `original_num + (10 - original_num \% 10)`, `delta` is \(10 - \text{second\_element} \% 10\)**
