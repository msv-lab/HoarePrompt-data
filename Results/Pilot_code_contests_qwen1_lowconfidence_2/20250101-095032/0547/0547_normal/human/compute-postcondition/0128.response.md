Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `nums` (of length `n`) and an integer `k`. It sorts the list in descending order based on the last digit of each integer. Then, it iteratively increases the last digit of each element in `nums` to the nearest multiple of 10 (if possible) using up to `k` units of "change". The process stops when `k` is depleted, the end of the list is reached, or all elements in the list are already multiples of 10. Finally, it prints the sum of the quotients when each number in the updated list is divided by 10. If an `IOError` occurs during input reading, the function handles it gracefully without changing the state of the variables.**

- The function accepts:
  - `n`: a positive integer representing the length of the list `nums`.
  - `k`: a non-negative integer representing the available "change" to update the numbers.
  - `nums`: a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 100 inclusive.

- The function returns:
  - The original list `nums` is modified in place and printed at the end.

- Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
  - If `k` is 0 when the function starts, no changes are made to `nums`, and the sum of the quotients of the original `nums` is printed.
  - If all elements in `nums` are already multiples of 10, no changes are made, and the sum of the quotients of the original `nums` is printed.
  - If an `IOError` occurs during input reading, the function handles it and does not change the state of the variables.

- The final state of the program after the function concludes:
  - `n` remains the same as the input.
  - `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer.
  - `stop` is `True` if `k` became 0, otherwise `stop` is `False`.
  - `i` is the index where the loop broke or `n` if the loop completed normally.
  - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, with some elements possibly updated to be multiples of 10.
  - The program prints the sum of the quotients when each number in the updated `nums` list is divided by 10.
