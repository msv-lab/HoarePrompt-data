The code sets `stop` to `False`, which changes its value from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stop` is `False`, `k` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`.**
