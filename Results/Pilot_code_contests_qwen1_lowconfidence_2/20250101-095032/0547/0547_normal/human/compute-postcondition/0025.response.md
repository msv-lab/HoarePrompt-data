The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to. Given the context, we assume it is within a loop that is iterating over the list `nums` and checking the condition `k == 0`.

Since the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables and merely skips to the next iteration of the loop, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `-delta`; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `False`; `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10` where `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
