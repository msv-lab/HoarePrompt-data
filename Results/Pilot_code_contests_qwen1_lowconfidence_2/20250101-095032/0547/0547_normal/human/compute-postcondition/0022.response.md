Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is `-delta`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer.
   - `nums[i]` was updated to `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`.
   - `stop` is `False`.
   - `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, i.e., `for i in range(0, n)`.

3. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] + (10 - nums[i] % 10)`.
   - This operation modifies `nums[i]` such that it becomes a multiple of 10.
   - The value of `k` remains `-delta` throughout the loop.
   - The value of `delta` is initially set to `10 - nums[i] % 10` and does not change within the loop.
   - `stop` remains `False` as long as the loop continues.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from its current value to `n-1`.
   - Since the loop condition is `range(0, n)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `k` will remain `-delta`.
   - `nums` remains the same as no changes occur outside the loop body.
   - `stop` remains `False`.
   - `delta` remains `10 - nums[i] % 10`.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

So, the final state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `-delta`; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `False`; `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10` where `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
