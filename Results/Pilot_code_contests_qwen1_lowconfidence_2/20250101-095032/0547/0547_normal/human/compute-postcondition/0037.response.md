Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `-2 * delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is `False`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n`. If `k == 0`, the state remains unchanged. If `nums[i]` is equal to 100, the state remains unchanged.***
