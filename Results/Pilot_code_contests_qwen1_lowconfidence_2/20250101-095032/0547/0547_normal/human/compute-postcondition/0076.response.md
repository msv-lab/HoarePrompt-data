Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - 2*delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `nums[3]` is the original value plus `delta`. Since the condition `nums[i] == 100` is false, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
