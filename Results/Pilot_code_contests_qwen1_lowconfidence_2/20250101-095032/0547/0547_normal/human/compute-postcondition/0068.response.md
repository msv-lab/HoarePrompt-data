Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `k` is 0 - delta; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is False; `i` is either 1 or 2; `nums[i]` is the original value before adding `delta`. If `k < delta`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the conditions remain unchanged if the condition is not met.***
