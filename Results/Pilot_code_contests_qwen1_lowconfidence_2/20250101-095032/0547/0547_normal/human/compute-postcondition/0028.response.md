The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break`, it simply indicates that the execution will exit the current context. However, no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `-delta`; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer; `stop` is `False`; `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10` where `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
