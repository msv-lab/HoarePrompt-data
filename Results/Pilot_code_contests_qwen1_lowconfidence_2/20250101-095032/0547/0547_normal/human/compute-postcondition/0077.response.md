`delta` is assigned the value `10 - nums[i] % 10`. Given that `i` is 3, `nums[i]` is `nums[3]`, which is the original value plus `delta`. Let's denote the original value as `original_value`. So, `nums[3] = original_value + delta`. 

Since `delta = 10 - (original_value + delta) % 10`, we can simplify this to find the exact value of `delta`. However, without the specific value of `original_value`, we know that `delta` is determined by the last digit of `nums[3]`.

Let's denote the last digit of `nums[3]` as `last_digit`. Thus, `delta = 10 - last_digit`.

The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `stop`, and `nums[3]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 - 2*delta, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, `stop` is False, `nums[3]` is the original value plus `delta`, `delta` is 10 - last digit of `nums[3]`.**
