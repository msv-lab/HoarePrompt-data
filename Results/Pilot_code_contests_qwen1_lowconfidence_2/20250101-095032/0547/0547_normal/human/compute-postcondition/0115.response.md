Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `stop` is `False`, `k` is `k - delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and if `nums[i] == 100`, the condition remains as is. If `nums[i] != 100`, the condition also remains as is since there is no action specified in the else part.***
