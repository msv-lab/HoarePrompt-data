The code `nums = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `nums`. The original values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. However, `nums` is now a list containing the split input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split()`**
