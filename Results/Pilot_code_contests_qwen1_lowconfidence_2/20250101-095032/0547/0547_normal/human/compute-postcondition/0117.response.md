The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. In this case, there is no loop or switch statement present in the given code snippet, so the values of the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement. The `break` statement does not affect any variables directly.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `stop` is `False`, `k` is `k - delta`, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the last digit of each integer, and `delta` is 5.**
