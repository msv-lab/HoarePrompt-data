The function `func_3` takes no parameters and returns the input provided by the user through the `input()` function. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has read a line of input from the user, which can be any string, and returned it. This includes handling the case where the input is empty, although the annotations do not explicitly mention this. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input; it simply reads it and returns it unchanged.
