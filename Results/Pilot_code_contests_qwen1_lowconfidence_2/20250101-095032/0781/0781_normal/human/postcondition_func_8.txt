The function `func_9` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It returns the integer division of `x` multiplied by `y` by the result of calling another function `func_8(x, y)`. There are no explicit edge cases handled within the function itself, and it is assumed that `func_8(x, y)` returns a non-zero value to prevent division by zero. If `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. After executing, the function sets the final state of the program such that the returned value is the integer division of `x * y` by `func_8(x, y)`.
