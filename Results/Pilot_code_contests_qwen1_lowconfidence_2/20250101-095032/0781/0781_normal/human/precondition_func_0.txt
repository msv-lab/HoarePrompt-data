T is an integer representing the number of bags, and for each bag: n is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n represents the fillings of the patty-cakes where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
