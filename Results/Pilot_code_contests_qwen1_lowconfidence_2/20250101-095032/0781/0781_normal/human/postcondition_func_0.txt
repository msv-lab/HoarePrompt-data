The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer representing the number of bags 'T'. It then returns this integer. The function does not perform any validation on the input to ensure it falls within the specified constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5). Therefore, it is possible for the user to input an invalid value, which would be returned without any error handling.
