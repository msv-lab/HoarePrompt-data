The function reads a line of space-separated integers from user input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input data. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values or no input at all, in which case the program would raise a ValueError. There is also no handling for the case where the input is empty, resulting in an empty map being returned.
