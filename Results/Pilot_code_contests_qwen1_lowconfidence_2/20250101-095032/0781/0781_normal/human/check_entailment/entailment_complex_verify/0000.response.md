Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_12` does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the maximum minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling is flawed. The annotated version highlights that the code sorts the patty-cakes and counts the occurrences of each filling but does not correctly determine the optimal order of eating the patty-cakes to maximize the minimum distance. The current implementation does not handle edge cases properly and does not provide the correct solution for the given problem description.
