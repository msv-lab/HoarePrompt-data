Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where all patty-cakes in a bag have unique fillings. According to the problem description, each bag must contain at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. However, the code logic in `func_12` does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the code checks if the maximum frequency (`s`) of any filling is equal to the total number of patty-cakes (`n`). If this condition is met, it incorrectly assumes that all fillings are unique and calls `func_13(0)`. This is incorrect because the problem guarantees that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

In this case, all patty-cakes have unique fillings, and the expected output should be `0` because the minimum distance cannot be determined as there are no repeated fillings. However, the current code will incorrectly output `0` and call `func_13(0)`, which is not correct.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
