You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pinkie Pie has bought a bag of patty-cakes with different fillings! But it appeared that not all patty-cakes differ from one another with filling. In other words, the bag contains some patty-cakes with the same filling.

Pinkie Pie eats the patty-cakes one-by-one. She likes having fun so she decided not to simply eat the patty-cakes but to try not to eat the patty-cakes with the same filling way too often. To achieve this she wants the minimum distance between the eaten with the same filling to be the largest possible. Herein Pinkie Pie called the distance between two patty-cakes the number of eaten patty-cakes strictly between them.

Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in any order. She is impatient about eating all the patty-cakes up so she asks you to help her to count the greatest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating!

Pinkie Pie is going to buy more bags of patty-cakes so she asks you to solve this problem for several bags!

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100): the number of bags for which you need to solve the problem.

The first line of each bag description contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5): the number of patty-cakes in it. The second line of the bag description contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n): the information of patty-cakes' fillings: same fillings are defined as same integers, different fillings are defined as different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each bag print in separate line one single integer: the largest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating for that bag.

Example

Input


4
7
1 7 1 6 4 4 6
8
1 1 4 6 4 6 4 7
3
3 3 3
6
2 5 2 3 1 4


Output


3
2
0
4

Note

For the first bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 3).

For the second bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 4, 6, 7, 4, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 2).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_12` attempts to solve the problem but does not handle the logic correctly for calculating the maximum minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Minimum Distance**: The function `func_12` sorts the patty-cakes and counts the occurrences of each filling using the array `f`. However, the logic for determining the maximum minimum distance is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the minimum distance without properly accounting for the gaps between patty-cakes with the same filling.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   1
   3
   1 1 1
   ```
   The correct output should be `1`, as the minimum distance between any two patty-cakes with the same filling is `1`. However, the current implementation would likely produce an incorrect result due to the flawed logic.

To illustrate the issue, let's take a specific example:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  7
  1 7 1 6 4 4 6
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```
- Actual Output (using the provided code):
  The code may not correctly compute the maximum minimum distance.

A correct approach would involve a more detailed algorithm to calculate the optimal order of eating the patty-cakes to maximize the minimum distance between the same fillings.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
