Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_12` attempts to solve the problem but does not handle the logic correctly for calculating the maximum minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Minimum Distance**: The function `func_12` sorts the patty-cakes and counts the occurrences of each filling using the array `f`. However, the logic for determining the maximum minimum distance is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the minimum distance without properly accounting for the gaps between patty-cakes with the same filling.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   1
   3
   1 1 1
   ```
   The correct output should be `1`, as the minimum distance between any two patty-cakes with the same filling is `1`. However, the current implementation would likely produce an incorrect result due to the flawed logic.

To illustrate the issue, let's take a specific example:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  7
  1 7 1 6 4 4 6
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```
- Actual Output (using the provided code):
  The code may not correctly compute the maximum minimum distance.

A correct approach would involve a more detailed algorithm to calculate the optimal order of eating the patty-cakes to maximize the minimum distance between the same fillings.
