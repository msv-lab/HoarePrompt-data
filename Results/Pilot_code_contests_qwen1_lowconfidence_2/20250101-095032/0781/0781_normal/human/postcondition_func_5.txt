The function accepts no explicit parameters but relies on the outputs of `func_5()` to process inputs (T, n, and a). It returns a list where T is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and for each bag, n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i, and it is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. 

After the function concludes, the program state is as follows:
- The returned list contains the processed data from `func_5()`, which includes T, n, and a, adhering to the specified constraints.
- The function ensures that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, as stated in the problem description.
- The function does not modify any external variables and only processes the data passed through `func_5()`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `func_5()` returns invalid data (e.g., T < 1 or T > 100, n < 2 or n > 10^5, or a_i values outside the valid range), the function should handle these cases appropriately. However, the code provided does not explicitly handle such cases, so the function may return incorrect results or raise exceptions depending on the implementation of `func_5()`.

Missing functionality:
- The code does not provide any specific logic for processing the data (T, n, and a) beyond returning them as a list. Therefore, it is assumed that `func_5()` performs the necessary processing and validation.
