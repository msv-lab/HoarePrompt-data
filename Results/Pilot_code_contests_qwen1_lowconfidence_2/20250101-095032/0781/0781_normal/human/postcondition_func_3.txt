The function `func_4` accepts an input string containing the integer values of `T` and `n`, followed by a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and returns a map object containing these values as strings. The input should be space-separated. The function does not validate the input format or the constraints on the values of `a_i`. If the input format is incorrect (e.g., non-integer values or invalid spacing), the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert the input to a map object. The function also does not handle the specific requirements regarding the values of `a_i` mentioned in the problem statement (i.e., `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n` and each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling).
