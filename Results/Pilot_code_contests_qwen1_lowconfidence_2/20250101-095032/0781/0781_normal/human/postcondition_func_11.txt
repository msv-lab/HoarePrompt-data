The function `func_12` processes a series of bags, each containing a certain number of patty-cakes with varying fillings. It iterates through each bag, sorts the fillings in descending order, counts the frequency of each filling, and determines the minimum number of operations required to ensure that no filling appears more than once in the bag. If there are at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, it calculates this minimum number of operations and calls `func_13` with the result. If there are no such patty-cakes, it also calculates and returns the result. The function handles edge cases where all fillings are unique or where the frequency distribution allows for specific optimizations. After processing all bags, the function ensures that `func_13` is called with the final calculated value.
