The function does not actually perform any actions related to the patty-cakes or the number of bags. Instead, it takes a variable number of arguments (`args`) and writes them to a specified output file with a specified separator (`sep`). If provided, it also writes an end character (`end`) and flushes the output buffer if requested. The function does not modify any input parameters and does not return any value. After the function execution, the output file will contain the provided arguments separated by the specified separator, followed by the end character, and the output buffer will be flushed if required.
