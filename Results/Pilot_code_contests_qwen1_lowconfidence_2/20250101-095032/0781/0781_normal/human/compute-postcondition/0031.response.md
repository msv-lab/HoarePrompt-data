Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs based on the return value of `func_1()`. This means we need to know what `func_1()` returns for the loop to continue.

2. **Identify the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `T`: Number of bags.
   - `n`: Final value after the loop.
   - `a`: List sorted in descending order.
   - `f`: List where the maximum value is either equal to `n` or unchanged.
   - Count of 1's in `f` is equal to `n - s`.
   - `ans` is equal to \((n - 1) // (s + 1)\).
   - `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - `func_13(ans)` has been called.

3. **Determine what changes occur in each iteration**:
   - Since the loop uses `range(func_1())`, the loop will run once for each call of `func_1()`. The exact effect of each call to `func_1()` is not specified, but we need to infer it from the context.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The only variable that is explicitly incremented or modified in the given state is `ans`. It is incremented by 1.
   - The function `func_13(ans)` is called, but no specific state changes are mentioned due to this function call.

Given that `ans` is incremented by 1 and assuming that `func_1()` returns a positive integer (since the loop continues if `func_1()` returns a non-zero value), the next iteration will depend on the updated value of `ans`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `T` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `f` remains the same (the maximum value is either unchanged or still `n`).
- `count of 1's in f` remains the same (still \(n - s\)).
- `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1\).
- `func_13(ans)` will be called again with the new value of `ans`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of bags, `n` is the final value after the loop, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, the maximum value of list `f` is either equal to `n` or unchanged, the count of 1's in the list `f` is equal to `n - s`, `ans` is equal to \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1\), `func_13(ans)` will be called.**
