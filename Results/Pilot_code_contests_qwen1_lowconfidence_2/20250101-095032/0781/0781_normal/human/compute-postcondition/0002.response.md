The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `T`, `n`, the list of fillings, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the output state includes these variables with their original values, and only updates the value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of bags, for each bag: `n` is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and a list of `n` integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, where each integer represents a unique filling type. Each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of `n` over all bags does not exceed 10^5; `sep` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout); `at_start` is `True`.**
