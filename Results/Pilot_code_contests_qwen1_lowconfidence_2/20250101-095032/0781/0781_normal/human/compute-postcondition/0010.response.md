`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the value of `sep` is not provided in the initial state, and none of the other variables (`at_start`, `args`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the content written to the file.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` contains at least two elements, and a string representation of `x` has been written to the file, `sep` is written to the file**
