Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `T` remains unchanged.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order.
   - `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros, where each `f[a[i]]` (for each `i` in the range of either `n` or `s`) is increased by 1.
   - `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1)`, where `s` is 2 or the current value of `n`.
   - `s` is equal to either 2 or the current value of `n`.
   - `func_13(0)` has been called.
   - The count of elements with value 1 in list `f` is equal to `n - s` if `s` equals 2, otherwise it is equal to `N - N` where `N` is the current value of `s`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   ans += 1
   ```

3. This line increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially set to `(n - 1) // (s + 1)`, incrementing it by 1 results in `ans` being `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each `f[a[i]]` (for each `i` in the range of either `n` or `s`) is increased by 1, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `s` is equal to either 2 or the current value of `n`, `func_13(0)` has been called, the count of elements with value 1 in list `f` is equal to `n - s` if `s` equals 2, otherwise it is equal to `N - N` where `N` is the current value of `s`.**
