The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `sep`. Additionally, the code does not change the value of `at_start` or `args`. Therefore, the only change is that `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`args` contains at least one element, the variable `at_start` is false, and `sep` has been written to the file.**
