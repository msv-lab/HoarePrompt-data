According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop continues as long as `args` contains at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is:
- `at_start` is False
- `args` contains at least one element
- A string representation of `x` has been written to the file

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element. Since we are about to enter the next iteration, we will consume one element from `args`, so `args` should contain at least two elements after this iteration.

State: **`at_start` is False, `args` contains at least two elements, and a string representation of `x` has been written to the file**
