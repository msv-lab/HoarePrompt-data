Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer representing the number of bags, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the sorted version of the original list `a` in descending order, the maximum value of list `f` is `n`, the count of 1's in the list `f` is `n`, `ans` is `n - 2` if `s` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each index `a[i]` (for `i = 0` to `i = n-1`) has its value incremented by 1, and `s` is a positive integer. If `f.count(1) == n - s`, then `ans` is adjusted accordingly; otherwise, the postcondition remains as specified in the if part.***
