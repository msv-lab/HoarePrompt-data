To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of bags.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is the sorted version of the original list `a` in descending order.
- The maximum value of list `f` is `n`.
- The count of 1's in the list `f` is `n`.
- `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.
- `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each index `a[i]` (for `i = 0` to `i = n-1`) has its value incremented by 1.
- `s` is a positive integer.
- The loop statement is `for _ in range(func_1()):`.

### Understanding the Loop:
The loop runs for a number of iterations determined by `func_1()`. Since the loop body is omitted, we need to focus on how the variables change within the loop to determine the new state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `T`: number of bags (unchanged).
   - `n`: positive integer (unchanged).
   - `a`: sorted list in descending order (unchanged).
   - `f`: list of 100,005 zeros, with each `a[i]` (for `i = 0` to `i = n-1`) incremented by 1 (unchanged).
   - `ans`: `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1` (unchanged).
   - `s`: positive integer (unchanged).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `func_1()` iterations.
   - During each iteration, the value of `f[a[i]]` is incremented for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Effect of Each Iteration:**
   - For each iteration, the value of `f[a[i]]` is incremented.
   - This means that if `a[i]` is the same for multiple iterations, the corresponding value in `f` will be incremented multiple times.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - After each iteration, the value of `f[a[i]]` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since the loop runs for `func_1()` iterations, each `a[i]` (for `i = 0` to `i = n-1`) will be incremented by `func_1()` times.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop runs for `func_1()` iterations, each element in the list `f` at the indices specified by `a` will be incremented by `func_1()` times. Therefore, the new state after one more iteration would be:

- `T` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `f` is updated such that each `f[a[i]]` (for `i = 0` to `i = n-1`) is incremented by `func_1()`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of bags, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the sorted version of the original list `a` in descending order, the maximum value of list `f` is `n + func_1()`, the count of 1's in the list `f` is `n + func_1()`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each index `a[i]` (for `i = 0` to `i = n-1`) has its value incremented by `func_1()`, and `s` is a positive integer.**
