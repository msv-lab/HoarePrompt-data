The function `func_13(ans)` is called, which takes the value of `ans` as an argument. However, the function itself is not defined in the given code snippet, so no changes are made to the variables `T`, `n`, `a`, `f`, `s`, `ans`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of bags, `n` is the final value after the loop, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, the maximum value of list `f` is either equal to `n` or unchanged, the count of 1's in the list `f` is equal to `n - s`, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1)` and `ans` is incremented by 1, `func_13(ans)` has been called.**
