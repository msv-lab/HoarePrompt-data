Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `args` is a list containing all the elements that were written to the file, `sep` and `file` retain their original values, and the file has been written with a newline character. Since `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` evaluates to `False`, no additional flush operation is performed.***
