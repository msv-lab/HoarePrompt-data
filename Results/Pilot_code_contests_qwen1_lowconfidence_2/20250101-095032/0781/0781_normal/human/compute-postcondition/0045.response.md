Postcondition: \( T \) is an integer representing the number of bags, \( n \) is a positive integer, \( a \) is the sorted version of the original list \( a \) in descending order, the maximum value of list \( f \) is \( n \), the count of 1's in the list \( f \) is \( n \), \( \text{ans} \) is \((n - 1) // 1 + 1\), \( f \) is a list of 100,005 zeros where each index \( a[i] \) (for \( i = 0 \) to \( i = n-1 \)) has its value incremented by 1, and \( s \) is \( n \). The current value of \( s \) is equal to \( n \).
