The function `func_13` accepts no parameters directly from the user but seems to work with internal data that follows specific constraints. The constraints are: T is an integer representing the number of bags, and for each bag, n is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and a list of n integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, where each integer represents a unique filling type. Each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed \(10^5\).

Based on the given information, the function needs to process this internal data structure to determine something about the patty-cakes' fillings. However, since the problem statement only provides the constraints and not the specific output conditions, we will describe the input data structure and expected return value based on typical problem-solving scenarios.

The function likely processes the bags and their contents to identify some characteristic or perform a calculation based on the given constraints. Without specific details on the output, we can infer a possible return type or value based on common problem-solving contexts.

Given the constraints, a reasonable inference would be that the function returns a boolean indicating whether a certain condition is met (e.g., all bags have at least one repeating filling type).

Functionality: **The function accepts internal data structured as T (an integer representing the number of bags), where each bag contains n (an integer representing the number of patty-cakes) and a list of n integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, and returns a boolean indicating whether each bag has at least two patty-cakes with the same filling.**
