`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` was originally \((N - 1) // (N + 1)\). After incrementing, the new value of `ans` becomes \((N - 1) // (N + 1) + 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer `N`, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each `f[a[i]]` (for each `i` in the range of `N`) is increased by 1, `ans` is \((N - 1) // (N + 1) + 1\), `s` is equal to `N`, and `func_13(0)` has been called. The count of elements with value 1 in list `f` is equal to `N - N`. `s` is not equal to 2.**
