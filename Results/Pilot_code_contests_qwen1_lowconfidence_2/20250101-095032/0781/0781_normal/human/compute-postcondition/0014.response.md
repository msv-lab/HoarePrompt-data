According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is `False`, which means the loop has already processed at least one element in `args`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args` that hasn't been processed yet. Therefore, `at_start` needs to be set to `True` again to indicate that we are at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`at_start` is True**
