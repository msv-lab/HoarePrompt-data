The function `func_13(ans)` is called, where `ans` is defined as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. Since `s` is either 2 or the current value of `n`, let's consider both cases:

1. If `s = 2`, then `ans = (n - 1) // (2 + 1) + 1 = (n - 1) // 3 + 1`.
2. If `s = n`, then `ans = (n - 1) // (n + 1) + 1`.

Since `func_13(ans)` is called, the value of `ans` is passed to this function, but no changes are made to the variables outside of this function call. The value of `ans` itself does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each `f[a[i]]` (for each `i` in the range of either `n` or `s`) is increased by 1, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `s` is equal to either 2 or the current value of `n`, `func_13(0)` has been called, the count of elements with value 1 in list `f` is equal to `n - s` if `s` equals 2, otherwise it is equal to `N - N` where `N` is the current value of `s`, and `func_13(ans)` has been called.**
