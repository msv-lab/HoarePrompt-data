The function `func_12` accepts a parameter `T`, which is an integer representing the number of bags. For each bag, `n` is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and there are at least two patty-cakes with the same filling.

The function has the following output cases:
- Case_1: `T` is an integer representing the number of bags.
- Case_2: For each bag, `n` is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes.
- Case_3: The function returns the result based on the fillings of the patty-cakes, specifically identifying if there are at least two patty-cakes with the same filling.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_12` is to accept an integer `T`, which represents the number of bags, and for each bag, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of patty-cakes and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. The function then checks if there are at least two patty-cakes with the same filling and returns the result accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `T`, which is an integer representing the number of bags, and for each bag, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of patty-cakes and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. The function then checks if there are at least two patty-cakes with the same filling and returns the result accordingly.**
