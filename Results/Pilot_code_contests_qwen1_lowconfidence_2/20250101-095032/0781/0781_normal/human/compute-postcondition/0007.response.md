The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the values of `args` or `at_start`. It only writes to the file and updates the `file` object.

Output State: **`args` contains at least one element, `at_start` is false, and a string representation of `x` has been written to the file.**
