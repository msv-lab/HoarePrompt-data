The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state and the code snippet only contains a `continue` statement without any loop context, the variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each `f[a[i]]` (for each `i` in the range of `n`) is increased by 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `s` is equal to `n`, and `func_13(0)` has been called.**
