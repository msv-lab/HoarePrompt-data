`kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` removes the key 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary if it exists, and returns the corresponding value (which is `\n` in this case). Then, `file.write('\n')` writes the newline character to the file. The variables `at_start`, `args`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a list containing all the elements that were written to the file, and `sep` and `file` retain their original values; the file has been written with a newline character.**
