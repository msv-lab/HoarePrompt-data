Postcondition: ***`T` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros where each `f[a[i]]` (for each `i` in the range of either `n` or `s`) is increased by 1, `ans` is `n - 2` if `s` equals 2, otherwise `ans` is \((N - 1) // (N + 1) + 1\) where `N` is the current value of `s`, `s` is equal to either 2 or the current value of `n`, and `func_13(0)` has been called. The count of elements with value 1 in list `f` is equal to `n - s` if `s` equals 2, otherwise it is equal to `N - N` where `N` is the current value of `s`.***
