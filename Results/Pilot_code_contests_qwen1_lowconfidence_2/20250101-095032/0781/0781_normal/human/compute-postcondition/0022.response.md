The `file.flush()` method flushes the write buffer of the file object, ensuring that all pending2 writes are actually written to the file. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `at_start`, `args`, `sep`, `file`, or the result of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)`. The state of the file itself would be affected, but since no new information about the file's state is provided, we cannot detail those changes.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a list containing all the elements that were written to the file, `sep` and `file` retain their original values, the file has been written with a newline character, `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` evaluates to `False`**
