Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a list containing all the elements that were written to the file, and `sep` and `file` retain their original values.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `T` is the number of bags.
   - For each bag, `n` is the number of patty-cakes in the bag, and there is a list of `n` integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes.
   - Each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling.
   - The sum of `n` over all bags does not exceed \(10^5\).
   - `sep` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
   - `file` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `args`.
   - If `at_start` is `False`, it writes `sep` to the file.
   - It then writes the string representation of `x` to the file.
   - `at_start` is set to `False` after the first iteration.

3. **After the Loop**:
   - Since the loop writes each element of `args` to the file separated by `sep`, `args` remains unchanged.
   - `at_start` is always `False` after the loop completes.
   - `sep` and `file` retain their original values because they are not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the final output state is that `at_start` is `False`, `args` contains all the elements that were written to the file (unchanged), and `sep` and `file` retain their original values.
