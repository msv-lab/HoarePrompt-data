Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer representing the number of bags, `n` is the final value after the loop, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, the maximum value of list `f` is either equal to `n` or unchanged, the count of 1's in the list `f` is equal to `n - s`. If `s == 2`, `ans` is equal to `n - 2`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. The loop continues with the next iteration if the if condition is not met.***
