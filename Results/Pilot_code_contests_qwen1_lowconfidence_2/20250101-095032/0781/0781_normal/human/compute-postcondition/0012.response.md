`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the values of `at_start`, `args`, or `sep`. The initial state is that `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least two elements, and a string representation of `x` has been written to the file. Since the code only writes `str(x)` to the file and does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` contains at least two elements, and a string representation of `x` has been written to the file.**
