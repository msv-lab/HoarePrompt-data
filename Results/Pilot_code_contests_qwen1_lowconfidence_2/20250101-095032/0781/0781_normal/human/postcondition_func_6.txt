The function processes data read from `input.txt` and writes the result to `output.txt`. It checks if each bag (represented by the variable `T`) contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling type. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but reads the required data from `input.txt`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is satisfied for all bags. If any bag does not contain at least two patty-cakes with the same filling type, the function will return `False`. If all bags meet the condition, the function will return `True`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the file `input.txt` is empty or does not exist, the function may raise an error.
- If the input data does not follow the expected format, the function may produce incorrect results.

Missing functionality:
- The code provided does not include the logic to read the input data and process it according to the described requirements. Specifically, it does not read the values of `T`, `n`, and the list of fillings for each bag, nor does it perform the check for duplicate fillings within each bag.
