T is an integer representing the number of bags, and for each bag: n is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. Each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least two indices i and j such that a_i = a_j.
