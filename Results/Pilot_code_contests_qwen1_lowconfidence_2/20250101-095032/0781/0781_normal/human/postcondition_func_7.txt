The function `func_8` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` is not zero. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the computation, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This means that after the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is guaranteed to be 0.
