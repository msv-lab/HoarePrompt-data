n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12. The input consists of three lines: the first line contains n pairs of integers representing the pairs communicated from the first participant to the second, the second line contains m pairs of integers representing the pairs communicated from the second participant to the first, and all pairs within each set are distinct, containing two different numbers between 1 and 9.
