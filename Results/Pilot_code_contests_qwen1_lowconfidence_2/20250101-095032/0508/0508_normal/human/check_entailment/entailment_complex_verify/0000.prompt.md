You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two participants are each given a pair of distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that there's exactly one number that is present in both pairs. They want to figure out the number that matches by using a communication channel you have access to without revealing it to you.

Both participants communicated to each other a set of pairs of numbers, that includes the pair given to them. Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers.

Determine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12) — the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.

The second line contains n pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.

The third line contains m pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.

All pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair (1,2), there will be no pair (2,1) within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.

It is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.

Output

If you can deduce the shared number with certainty, print that number.

If you can with certainty deduce that both participants know the shared number, but you do not know it, print 0.

Otherwise print -1.

Examples

Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 3 4


Output

1


Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 6 4


Output

0


Input

2 3
1 2 4 5
1 2 1 3 2 3


Output

-1

Note

In the first example the first participant communicated pairs (1,2) and (3,4), and the second communicated (1,5), (3,4). Since we know that the actual pairs they received share exactly one number, it can't be that they both have (3,4). Thus, the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), and at this point you already know the shared number is 1.

In the second example either the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), or the first has (3,4) and the second has (6,4). In the first case both of them know the shared number is 1, in the second case both of them know the shared number is 4. You don't have enough information to tell 1 and 4 apart.

In the third case if the first participant was given (1,2), they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either (1,3), in which case the shared number is 1, or (2,3), in which case the shared number is 2. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is -1.

            (c, d) = (p2[2 * j], p2[2 * j + 1])

                kandidat = a
            else:
                kandidat = b
            cand.add(kandidat)
            cc[i].add(kandidat)
            dd[j].add(kandidat)
    if len(cand) == 1:
        print(cand.pop())
    elif max((len(cc[i]) for i in range(n))) <= 1 and max((len(dd[i]) for i in range(m))) <= 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(-1)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for identifying the candidate number and ensuring that both participants know the number but you do not know it is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 1 9 2 3
```
The program should correctly identify that the shared number is 1, as both participants would know it, but you (the verifier) would not have enough information to deduce it. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly and may produce an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly identifies the unique shared number and handles cases where both participants know the number but you do not. The current logic does not fully address these requirements, leading to potential errors in certain scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12, and a list of n pairs of integers and a list of m pairs of integers are provided, where each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and 9. It is also guaranteed that there is at least one pair in the first list and one pair in the second list that share exactly one number.

    dd = [set() for i in range(m)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            a, b = p1[2 * i], p1[2 * i + 1]
            c, d = p2[2 * j], p2[2 * j + 1]
            if a not in (c, d) and b not in (c, d):
                continue

                kandidat = a
            else:
                kandidat = b
            cand.add(kandidat)

    if (len(cand) == 1) :
        print(cand.pop())

        if (max(len(cc[i]) for i in range(n)) <= 1 and max(len(dd[i]) for i in range(m

If `max((len(cc[i]) for i in range(n))) <= 1` and `max((len(dd[i]) for i in range(m))) <= 1`, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*i]`, `b` is `p1[2*i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cand` is either an empty set or a set containing all unique `kandidat` values, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`. If `len(cand) == 1`, the program prints 0 if `max((len(cc[i]) for i in range(n))) <= 1` and `max((len(dd[i]) for i in range(m))) <= 1`, otherwise it prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, both within the range of 1 to 12, and two lists of pairs of integers. Each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and 9. The function iterates through these pairs to find if there is at least one pair from the first list and one pair from the second list that share exactly one common number. If such a pair is found, it adds the shared number to a set `cand`. After processing all pairs, the function checks the following conditions:
1. If `cand` contains exactly one element, it prints that element.
2. If the maximum size of any set in `cc` or `dd` is less than or equal to 1, and `cand` is non-empty, it prints 0.
3. In all other cases, it prints -1.

The function ensures that if no such pairs are found or if the conditions mentioned above do not hold, it correctly returns -1. This covers all possible edge cases including when there are no shared numbers or when the conditions for printing 0 are met.
