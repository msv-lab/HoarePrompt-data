Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Pair Splitting and Parsing**: 
   - The program incorrectly splits the input into pairs. Specifically, it uses `raw_input().split()` and `map(int, raw_input().split())` which does not correctly parse the input into pairs of integers. The expected input format should be a series of space-separated numbers followed by another series, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Pair Iteration**:
   - The nested loops iterating over `p1` and `p2` to find matching pairs are not implemented correctly. The logic inside the loop checks for the presence of a number in both pairs but does not properly extract and compare pairs as described in the problem statement.

3. **Candidate Identification**:
   - The identification of candidates (`kandidat`) is flawed. The program assumes that pairs can be split directly into `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` without properly forming the pairs from the input lists. This leads to incorrect identification of the shared number.

4. **Set Handling**:
   - The sets `cc` and `dd` are not being populated correctly. Each element in `cc` and `dd` should represent a set of candidates for each pair from the respective participant, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 3 4
```

The program should correctly identify that the shared number is `1` because the pairs `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)` from the first participant and the pairs `(1, 5)` and `(3, 4)` from the second participant share the number `1`.

However, the current program does not correctly parse and process the pairs, leading to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    p1 = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    p2 = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

    cand = set()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            a, b = p1[i]
            c, d = p2[j]
            if {a, b} & {c, d} == {a} or {a, b} & {c, d} == {b}:
                cand.add(a) if {a, b} & {c, d} == {a} else cand.add(b)

    if len(cand) == 1:
        print(cand.pop())
    elif max(len(set.union(*[set(pair) for pair in p1])), len(set.union(*[set(pair) for pair in p2]))) <= 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version correctly processes the pairs and identifies the shared number as required.
