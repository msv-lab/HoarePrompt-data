`c` and `d` are assigned the values from `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` respectively. Since `j` is initially 0, `c` is assigned `p2[0]` and `d` is assigned `p2[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`**
