The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is in (`c`, `d`), `b` is in (`c`, `d`), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`.**
