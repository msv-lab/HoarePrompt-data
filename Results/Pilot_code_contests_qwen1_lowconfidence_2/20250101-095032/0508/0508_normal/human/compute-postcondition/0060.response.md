Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, and since the if condition `a in (c, d) and b in (c, d)` evaluates to True, the values of `a` and `b` are already in the set `{c, d}`. No changes occur in these variables, and the same conditions hold true as the precondition.***
