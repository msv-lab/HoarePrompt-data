`cc[i]` is a list, and `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds `kandidat` to the list `cc[i]`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `cc[i]` was initially either `[a, a]` or `[a, b]`, after adding `kandidat`, `cc[i]` will now be either `[a, a, a]` (if `kandidat` was already `a`), `[a, b, a]` (if `kandidat` was `a` and the initial list did not contain `a`), `[a, a, b]` (if `kandidat` was `b` and the initial list contained `a`), or `[a, b, b]` (if `kandidat` was `b` and the initial list already contained `b`). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is either `{a}` or `{b}`, `cc[0]` is either `[a, a, a]`, `[a, b, a]`, `[a, a, b]`, or `[a, b, b]`, `dd[0]` is either `a` or `b`, `dd[1]` is either `[a]` or `[a, b]`, and `cand` contains `kandidat`.**
