State before the loop starts: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. The initial value of `i` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's ability to execute, as the loop starts with `j` initialized to 0 by the `range(m)` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
