Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`, `kandidat` is either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `cc[0]` is a set containing two elements both being `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing two elements: the original `kandidat` and the new `kandidat`. Since the if condition `a in (c, d) and b in (c, d)` is checked and the `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the loop iteration, the preconditions remain unchanged after the if-else block executes.***
