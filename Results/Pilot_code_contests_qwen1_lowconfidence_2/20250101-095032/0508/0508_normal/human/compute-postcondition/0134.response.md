The code assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `kandidat` was either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`. Now, `kandidat` is explicitly set to `a`.

The output state is:
**`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2 * (n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2 * (n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is `a`.**
