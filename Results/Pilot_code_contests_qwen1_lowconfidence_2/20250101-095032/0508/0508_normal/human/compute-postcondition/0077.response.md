The code assigns the value of `b` to `kandidat`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `kandidat` is `b`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.**
