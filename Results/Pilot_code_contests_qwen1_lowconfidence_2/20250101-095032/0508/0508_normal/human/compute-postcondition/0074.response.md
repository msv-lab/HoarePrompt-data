The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not change any variables or affect the state of the program. All the variables remain in their original state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.**
