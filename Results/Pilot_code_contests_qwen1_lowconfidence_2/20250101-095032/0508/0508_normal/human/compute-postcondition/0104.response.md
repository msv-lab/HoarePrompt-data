The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and goes to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2*j]`, `d` is `p2[2*j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`. The values of `a` and `b` are equal to either `c` or `d`, and both `a` and `b` are in the sets `cc[i]` and `dd[j]` respectively.**
