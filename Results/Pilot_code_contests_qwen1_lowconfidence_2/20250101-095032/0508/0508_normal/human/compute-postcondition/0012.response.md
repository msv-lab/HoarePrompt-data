Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, and if `a` is not in (`c`, `d`) and `b` is not in (`c`, `d`), this condition holds. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` is implied since there is no specific action mentioned in the else part.***
