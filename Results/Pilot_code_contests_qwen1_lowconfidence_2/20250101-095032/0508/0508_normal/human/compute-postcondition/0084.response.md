The code assigns `p2[2 * j]` to `c` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` to `d`. Given that `j` is 2, `2 * j` is 4 and `2 * j + 1` is 5. Therefore, `c` is assigned the value of `p2[4]` and `d` is assigned the value of `p2[5]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is either `{a}` or `{b}`, `cc[0]` is either `[a, a]` or `[a, b]`, `dd[0]` is either `a` or `b`, `dd[1]` is either `[a]` or `[a, b]`**
