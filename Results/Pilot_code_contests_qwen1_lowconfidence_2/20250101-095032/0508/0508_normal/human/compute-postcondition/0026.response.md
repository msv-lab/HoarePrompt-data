The code `c, d = p2[2 * j], p2[2 * j + 1]` updates the values of `c` and `d`. However, the initial values of `p2` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new values of `c` and `d`. But we know that `c` will take the value of `p2[2 * j]` and `d` will take the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `kandidat` is equal to either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`**
