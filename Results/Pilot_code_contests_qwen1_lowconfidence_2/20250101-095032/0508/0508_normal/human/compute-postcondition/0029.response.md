The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if inside one) and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop or conditional structure (like `if-else`) in the given code snippet that would be directly affected by this statement, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `kandidat` is equal to either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`. If `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no specific changes are made since there is no else part specified.**
