The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing the statements outside the loop. The values of the variables are not changed, and the loop continues with the next iteration based on the condition.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m`, `c` is `p2[2*m]`, `d` is `p2[2*m + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`), `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
