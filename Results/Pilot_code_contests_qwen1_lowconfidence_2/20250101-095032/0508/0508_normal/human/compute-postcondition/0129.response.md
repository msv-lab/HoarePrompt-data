The code updates the values of `c` and `d` to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` respectively. This means the values of `c` and `d` are now different from their previous values. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

- `c` is updated to `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is updated to `p2[2 * j + 1]`.

The rest of the variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `kandidat`, `cc`, `dd`, `p1`, `p2`) remain in their original states as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2 * (n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2 * (n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, `a` is now `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is now `p1[2 * i + 1]`.**
