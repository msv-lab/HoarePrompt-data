The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables directly and simply moves to the next iteration of any existing loop. Given that there is no explicit loop in the provided code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, and the value of `a` is not in the set `{c, d}` and the value of `b` is not in the set `{c, d}`.**
