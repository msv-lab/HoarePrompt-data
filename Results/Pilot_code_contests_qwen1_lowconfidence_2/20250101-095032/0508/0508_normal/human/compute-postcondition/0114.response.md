Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`
- `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` must be at least 1
- `j` is `m-1`
- `c` is `p2[2*j]`
- `d` is `p2[2*j + 1]`
- `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`
- `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`)
- `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates over `range(m)`. Since `j` is currently `m-1`, the loop will execute one more time when `j` becomes `m`.

2. **Variables Not Directly Dependent on `j`**:
   - `i` remains `n-1`.
   - `a` remains `p1[2*(n-1)]`.
   - `b` remains `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `m` remains at least 1.
   - `c` remains `p2[2*j]`.
   - `d` remains `p2[2*j + 1]`.
   - `cand` remains a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`.
   - `cc[i]` remains a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`).
   - `dd[j]` remains a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added.

### Adjusted States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `j` will be incremented from `m-1` to `m`, so `j` becomes `m`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m`, `c` is `p2[2*m]`, `d` is `p2[2*m + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`), `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added.**
