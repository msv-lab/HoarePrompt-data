The code assigns `p2[2 * j]` to `c` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` to `d`. However, the value of `j` is not defined in the given initial state or code snippet. Since `j` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. But we know that `c` and `d` are elements from the list `p2` at indices `2 * j` and `2 * j + 1` respectively.

The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`**
