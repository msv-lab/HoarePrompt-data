Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*i]`, `b` is `p1[2*i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`. If `max((len(cc[i]) for i in range(n))) <= 1` and `max((len(dd[i]) for i in range(m))) <= 1`, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
