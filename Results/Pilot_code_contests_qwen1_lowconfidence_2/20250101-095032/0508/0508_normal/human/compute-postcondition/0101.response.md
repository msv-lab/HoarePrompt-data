The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the execution simply moves to the next line without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2*j]`, `d` is `p2[2*j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`. The values of `a` and `b` are neither equal to `c` nor `d`.**
