The code assigns the value of `b` to the variable `kandidat`. This means the value of `kandidat` is updated to be the same as `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m`, `c` is `p2[2*m]`, `d` is `p2[2*m + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`), `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added, `kandidat` is `b`.
