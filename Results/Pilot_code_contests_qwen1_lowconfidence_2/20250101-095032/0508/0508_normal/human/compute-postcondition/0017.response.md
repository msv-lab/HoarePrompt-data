The code assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. This means `kandidat` now holds the same value as `a`, which is within the range defined by `c` and `d`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is in (`c`, `d`), `b` is in (`c`, `d`), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is equal to `a`**
