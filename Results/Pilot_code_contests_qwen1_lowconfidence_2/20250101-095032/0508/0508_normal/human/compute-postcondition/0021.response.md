`cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either equal to `a` or `b`, and both `a` and `b` are in the tuple (`c`, `d`), the set `cand` will contain one of these values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is in (`c`, `d`), `b` is in (`c`, `d`), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, and either `kandidat` is equal to `a` or `kandidat` is equal to `b`.**
