Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2*j]`, `d` is `p2[2*j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`.***
