Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`. If `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, then the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition when the if condition is true.***
