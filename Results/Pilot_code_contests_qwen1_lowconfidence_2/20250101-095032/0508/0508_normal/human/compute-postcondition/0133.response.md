Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2 * (n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2 * (n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, and the loop continues to the next iteration if both `a` and `b` are not in `(c, d)`. If `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, the loop condition is satisfied as they are checked within the if condition.***
