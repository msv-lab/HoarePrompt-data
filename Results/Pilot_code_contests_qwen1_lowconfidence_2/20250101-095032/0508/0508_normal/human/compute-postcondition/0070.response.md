`a` and `b` are assigned the values of `p1[2 * i]` and `p1[2 * i + 1]` respectively. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a` is updated to `p1[0]` and `b` is updated to `p1[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
