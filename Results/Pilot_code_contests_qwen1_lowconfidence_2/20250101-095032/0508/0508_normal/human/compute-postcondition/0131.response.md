Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2 * (n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2 * (n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, `a` is now `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is now `p1[2 * i + 1]`. If `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
