Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`
   - `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `j` is `m`
   - `c` is `p2[2*m]`
   - `d` is `p2[2*m + 1]`
   - `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`
   - `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with the additional element `kandidat`
   - `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added
   - `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`
   - `dd[j]` is updated with the new value of `kandidat`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially set to `m` (which means it was already the last iteration), we need to adjust `j` to `m-1` to allow for another iteration.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `d`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `kandidat`) remain unchanged because the loop body does not alter these variables unless explicitly stated.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is now `m-1`
- All other variables remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2*m]`, `d` is `p2[2*m + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with the additional element `kandidat`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`; `dd[j]` is updated with the new value of `kandidat`.**
