First, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet:

Initial State:
- `i` is 0
- `a` is `p1[0]`
- `b` is `p1[1]`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` must be at least 1
- `j` is 0
- `c` is `p2[0]`
- `d` is `p2[1]`
- If `a` is in the set `{c, d}`, `kandidat` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`.

Code Snippet:
```python
cand.add(kandidat)
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Determine the value of `kandidat` based on the initial conditions:
   - `kandidat` is `a` if `a` is in the set `{c, d}`.
   - `kandidat` is `b` if `a` is not in the set `{c, d}`.

2. Add `kandidat` to the set `cand`.

Since the value of `cand` and its contents are not specified in the initial state, we assume `cand` is initially an empty set.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet:
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` (depending on whether `a` is in the set `{c, d}`).
- `cand` is a set containing one element, which is `kandidat`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat` (where `kandidat` is `a` if `a` is in the set `{c, d}` and `b` otherwise)**
