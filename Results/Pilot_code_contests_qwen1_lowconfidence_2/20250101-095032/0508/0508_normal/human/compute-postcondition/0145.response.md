Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*i]`, `b` is `p1[2*i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`. The length of `cand` is not equal to 1, and the maximum length of sets `cc[i]` for all `i` in range `n` is less than or equal to 1, and the maximum length of sets `dd[i]` for all `i` in range `m` is less than or equal to 1.***
