The code adds `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, the set `cand` will contain one of these two values. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`, `kandidat` is either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`.**
