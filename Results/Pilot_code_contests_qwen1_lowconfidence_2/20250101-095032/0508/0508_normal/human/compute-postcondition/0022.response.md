The code `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 0, and `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`. The set `cc[0]` will now contain one element, which is either `a` or `b`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is in (`c`, `d`), `b` is in (`c`, `d`), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b`, and either `kandidat` is equal to `a` or `kandidat` is equal to `b`; `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`**
