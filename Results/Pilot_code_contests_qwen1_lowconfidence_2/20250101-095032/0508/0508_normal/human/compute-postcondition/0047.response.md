The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the variable `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Given the initial state, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`. Since `kandidat` is already part of the set `cand`, adding `kandidat` to `cand` does not change the set.

Therefore, the set `cand` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their initial values. The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` is a set containing two elements both being `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing two elements: the original `kandidat` and the new `kandidat`.**
