The code `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the standard input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The initial states of `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 12\). After executing this line of code, `n` and `m` will hold the specific integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, and both satisfy \(1 \leq n, m \leq 12\)**.
