The code updates the values of `c` and `d`. Initially, `c` is `p2[0]` and `d` is `p2[1]`. After the code runs, `c` is assigned the value of `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is assigned the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`. Since `j` is 1, `c` becomes `p2[2]` and `d` becomes `p2[3]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
