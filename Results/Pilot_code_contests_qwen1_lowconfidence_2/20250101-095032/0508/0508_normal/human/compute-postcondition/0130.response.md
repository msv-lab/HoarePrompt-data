The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, we assume there was a loop before the `continue` statement. However, the exact loop is not mentioned, so we focus on the variables that might be affected within the context provided.

Given the initial state and the fact that `continue` does not change the values of any variables outside of the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is that the loop moves to the next iteration without executing the remaining code inside the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2 * (n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2 * (n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, `a` is now `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is now `p1[2 * i + 1]`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
