`dd[j]` is a set that adds the value `kandidat`. Since `j` is 0, `dd[j]` is the same as `dd[0]`. The value of `kandidat` is added to `dd[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
