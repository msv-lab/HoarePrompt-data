The code `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 0,
- `a` is `p1[0]`,
- `b` is `p1[1]`,
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1,
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`,
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`,
- `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`,
- `kandidat` is either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`,
- `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`,
- `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`.

Since `i` is 0, the code modifies `cc[0]` by adding `kandidat` to the set `cc[0]`. Initially, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, and after the code executes, `cc[0]` will contain both `kandidat` (since it was already there) and the new `kandidat` (assuming it's the same as before, which is implied in this context).

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`, `kandidat` is either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `cc[0]` is a set containing two elements both being `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`.**
