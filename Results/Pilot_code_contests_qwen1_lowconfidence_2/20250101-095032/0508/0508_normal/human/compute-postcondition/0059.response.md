The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, and the value of `a` is not in the set `{c, d}` and the value of `b` is not in the set `{c, d}`, and both `a` and `b` are currently in the set `{c, d}`.**
