The code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to `p2`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `p1` are not altered by this operation. The new list `p2` is created by converting each element in the input line into an integer using the `map` function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, and both satisfy \(1 \leq n, m \leq 12\); `p1` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `p2` is a list of integers read from another input line**
