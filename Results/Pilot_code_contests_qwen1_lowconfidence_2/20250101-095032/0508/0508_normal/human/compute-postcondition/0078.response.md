Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`. If `a` is in `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is `a`, `cand` is a set containing `a`, `cc[0]` contains `a`, `dd[0]` contains `a`. Otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.***
