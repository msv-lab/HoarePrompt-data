`kandidat` is assigned the value of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, and `a` is not in the set `{c, d}`, or `b` is not in the set `{c, d}`; `kandidat` is `b`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, and `a` is not in the set `{c, d}`, or `b` is not in the set `{c, d}`; `kandidat` is `b`**.
