Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is in (`c`, `d`), `b` is in (`c`, `d`), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `a` is not in (`c`, `d`)***

This postcondition includes all the original preconditions and negates the if condition, ensuring that the program state reflects that the if block was not entered and the else block was executed instead.
