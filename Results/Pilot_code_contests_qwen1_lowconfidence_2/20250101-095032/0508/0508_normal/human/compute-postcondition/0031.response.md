The code assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. Since `a` is equal to `p1[0]`, `kandidat` is now `p1[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `kandidat` is `p1[0]`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`.
