`kandidat` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `kandidat` is now equal to `a`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `kandidat` is `a`, `cand` is a set containing `a`, `cc[0]` contains `a`, `dd[0]` contains `a`.**
