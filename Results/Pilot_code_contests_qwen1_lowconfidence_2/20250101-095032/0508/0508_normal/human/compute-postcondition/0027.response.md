The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged, and the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `kandidat` is equal to either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing `kandidat`.**
