Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is either `{a}` or `{b}`, `cc[0]` is either `[a, a]` or `[a, b]`, `dd[0]` is either `a` or `b`, `dd[1]` is either `[a]` or `[a, b]`. If `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, no specific changes are mentioned for the variables in the else part, so the state of the variables stays as per the if condition check.***
