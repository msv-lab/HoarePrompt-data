According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:

- `i` is 0
- `a` is `p1[0]`
- `b` is `p1[1]`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` must be at least 1
- `j` is 0
- `c` is `p2[0]`
- `d` is `p2[1]`
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`
- `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Given that `j` is currently 0 and `m` is at least 1, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `j < m`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be 1 (since it is incremented by 1).
- `m` remains the same (it must still be at least 1).

The other states do not change because they are not affected by the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
