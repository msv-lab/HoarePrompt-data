The code adds the `kandidat` value to the set `dd[j]`. Given that `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, we need to determine which value `kandidat` holds.

From the initial state:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`
- `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` must be at least 1
- `j` is `m-1`
- `c` is `p2[2*j]`
- `d` is `p2[2*j + 1]`
- `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`
- `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`)
- `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`

To determine `kandidat`, we check if `a` is in `(c, d)`:
- If `a` is in `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is `a`.
- Otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`.

Since `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`, adding `kandidat` to `dd[j]` will update `dd[j]` to include the new value of `kandidat`.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `dd[j]` includes the new value of `kandidat` (either `a` or `b`).

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2*j]`, `d` is `p2[2*j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`), `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added.**
