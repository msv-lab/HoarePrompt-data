`kandidat` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is in the set `{c, d}`, so `kandidat` is also in the set `{c, d}`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `kandidat` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `kandidat` is equal to `a`**
