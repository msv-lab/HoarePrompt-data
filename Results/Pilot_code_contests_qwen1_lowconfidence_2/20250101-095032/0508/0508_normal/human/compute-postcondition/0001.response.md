The code `p1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `p1`. Since the input is read using `raw_input()`, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The initial values of `n` and `m` are still integers read from input, and both satisfy \(1 \leq n, m \leq 12\). After executing the code, `p1` will be a list of integers derived from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, and both satisfy \(1 \leq n, m \leq 12\); `p1` is a list of integers derived from the input line**
