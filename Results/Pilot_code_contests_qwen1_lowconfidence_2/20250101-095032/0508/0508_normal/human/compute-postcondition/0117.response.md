The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing any code in the loop body for the current iteration. The values of the variables are not changed by the `continue` statement itself. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m`, `c` is `p2[2*m]`, `d` is `p2[2*m + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with an additional element (either `a` or `b`), `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
