Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cc[0]` is a set containing two elements both being `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing two elements: the original `kandidat` and the new `kandidat`.***

Explanation:
- If the condition `a in (c, d)` is true, then `kandidat` is set to `a` and `cc[0]` is a set containing two elements both being `kandidat`. `dd[1]` is a set containing two elements: the original `kandidat` and the new `kandidat`.
- If the condition `a in (c, d)` is false, then `kandidat` is assigned the value of `b` and becomes `p1[1]`. The preconditions and other variables remain unchanged.
