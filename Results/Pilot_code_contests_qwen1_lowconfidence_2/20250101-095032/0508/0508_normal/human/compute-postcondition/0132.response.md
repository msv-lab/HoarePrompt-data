The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. No changes are made to the values of the variables within the scope of the loop. 

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the variables `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2 * (n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2 * (n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, `a` is now `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is now `p1[2 * i + 1]`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
