Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2*j]`, `d` is `p2[2*j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m-1`.
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `m-1` because the loop condition `j < m` will fail when `j` reaches `m`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, the loop checks conditions involving `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
   - If both `a` and `b` are not in `(c, d)`, or if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, the loop continues without adding any `kandidat` value.
   - If exactly one of `a` or `b` is in `(c, d)`, the corresponding `kandidat` value (`a` or `b`) is added to the sets `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j]`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After all iterations, the following will hold:
     - `i` remains `n-1` because the loop does not change this variable.
     - `a` and `b` will be the last pair of values from `p1` accessed during the loop, i.e., `p1[2*(n-1)]` and `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`.
     - `n` must be greater than 0, as per the initial state.
     - `m` must be at least 1, as per the initial state.
     - `j` will be `m-1` after the loop completes.
     - `c` and `d` will be the last pair of values from `p2` accessed during the loop, i.e., `p2[2*(m-1)]` and `p2[2*(m-1) + 1]`.
     - `cand` will be a set containing all unique `kandidat` values that were added during the loop.
     - `cc[i]` will be a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, which means it will contain all `kandidat` values added for `i` during the loop.
     - `dd[j]` will be a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`, which means it will contain all `kandidat` values added for `j` during the loop.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the variables `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `c`, and `d` retain their final values as described above. The set `cand` contains all unique `kandidat` values, and the sets `cc[i]` and `dd[j]` contain all `kandidat` values added during the loop.
