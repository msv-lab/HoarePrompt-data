The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12. Additionally, the function receives two lists as input: a list of `n` pairs of integers and a list of `m` pairs of integers, where each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and 9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one pair in the first list and one pair in the second list that share exactly one number. The function returns a value based on the condition that there is at least one pair in the first list and one pair in the second list that share exactly one number.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both integers between 1 and 12, and two lists of pairs of integers. Each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and 9. The function returns a value indicating whether there is at least one pair in the first list and one pair in the second list that share exactly one number.**
