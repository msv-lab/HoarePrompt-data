`cand.pop()` removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set `cand`. Since `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values with exactly one element, after popping the element, `cand` will be an empty set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*i]`, `b` is `p1[2*i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cand` is an empty set, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j`.**
