According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is either `{a}` or `{b}`, `cc[0]` is either `[a, a]` or `[a, b]`, `dd[0]` is either `a` or `b`, `dd[1]` is either `[a]` or `[a, b]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `m` must be at least 1, the loop can execute one more time if `m` is greater than 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the following states:
- `i` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `a` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `b` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is incremented by 1 so `j` becomes 2.
- `c` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `d` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `kandidat` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `cand` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `cc[0]` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `dd[0]` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `dd[1]` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop condition.

State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is either `{a}` or `{b}`, `cc[0]` is either `[a, a]` or `[a, b]`, `dd[0]` is either `a` or `b`, `dd[1]` is either `[a]` or `[a, b]`**
