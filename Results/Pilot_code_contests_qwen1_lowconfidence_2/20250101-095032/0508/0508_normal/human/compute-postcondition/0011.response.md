The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `a` is not in (`c`, `d`), and `b` is not in (`c`, `d`)**
