`cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, the value of `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2 * (n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2 * (n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m-1`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, and `cc[i]` now includes `kandidat`.**
