The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables and simply continues to the next line of code after the statement. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is either `{a}` or `{b}`, `cc[0]` is either `[a, a]` or `[a, b]`, `dd[0]` is either `a` or `b`, `dd[1]` is either `[a]` or `[a, b]`.**
