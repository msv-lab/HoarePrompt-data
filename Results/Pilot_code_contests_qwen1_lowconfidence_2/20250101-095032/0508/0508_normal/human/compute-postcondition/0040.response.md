The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables directly but indicates that the loop continues without executing the following code block.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]` plus `kandidat`, `kandidat` is either `p1[0]` or `p1[1]`, `cc[0]` is a set containing two elements both being `kandidat`, `dd[1]` is a set containing two elements: the original `kandidat` and the new `kandidat`.**
