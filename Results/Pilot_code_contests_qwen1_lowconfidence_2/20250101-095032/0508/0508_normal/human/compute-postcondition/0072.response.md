The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop context given, the statement itself does not change any variable values. However, we can infer that this statement is likely within a loop, and the loop would continue its normal flow without changing the values of the variables mentioned.

Given the initial state:

- `i` is 0
- `a` is `p1[0]`
- `b` is `p1[1]`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` must be at least 1
- `j` is 1
- `c` is `p2[2]`
- `d` is `p2[3]`
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`
- `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`

The `continue` statement does not affect these values, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is `p1[0]`, `b` is `p1[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
