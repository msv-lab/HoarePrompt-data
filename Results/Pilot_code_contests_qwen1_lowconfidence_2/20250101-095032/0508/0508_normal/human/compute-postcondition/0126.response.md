`dd[j]` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `a` is in `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is `a`.
2. If `a` is not in `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is `b`.

In both cases, the set `dd[j]` will include the updated value of `kandidat`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is `p1[2*(n-1)]`, `b` is `p1[2*(n-1) + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is `m`, `c` is `p2[2*m]`, `d` is `p2[2*m + 1]`, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values including the current `kandidat`, `cc[i]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `i` with the additional element `kandidat`, `dd[j]` is a set containing all `kandidat` values for `j` with the new value of `kandidat` added, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` depending on whether `a` is in `(c, d)`; `dd[j]` is updated with the new value of `kandidat`.**
