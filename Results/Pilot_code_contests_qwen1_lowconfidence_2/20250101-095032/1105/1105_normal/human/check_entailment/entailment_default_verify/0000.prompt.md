You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n slimes in a row. Each slime has an integer value (possibly negative or zero) associated with it.

Any slime can eat its adjacent slime (the closest slime to its left or to its right, assuming that this slime exists). 

When a slime with a value x eats a slime with a value y, the eaten slime disappears, and the value of the remaining slime changes to x - y.

The slimes will eat each other until there is only one slime left. 

Find the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000) denoting the number of slimes.

The next line contains n integers a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the value of i-th slime.

Output

Print an only integer — the maximum possible value of the last slime.

Examples

Input

4
2 1 2 1


Output

4

Input

5
0 -1 -1 -1 -1


Output

4

Note

In the first example, a possible way of getting the last slime with value 4 is:

  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -1, 1
  * Second slime eats the third slime, the row now contains slimes 2, -2
  * First slime eats the second slime, the row now contains 4 



In the second example, the first slime can keep eating slimes to its right to end up with a value of 4.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, a) = (int(input()), rints())
    neg = len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, a)))
    pos = n - neg
    if neg:
        print(sum((abs(x) for x in a)))
    else:
        (ans, s) = (0, sum(a))
        for i in range(n):
            if i and a[i] < a[i - 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i - 1])
            elif i < n - 1 and a[i] < a[i + 1]:
                ans = max(ans, s - a[i + 1])
        print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of the last slime. The issue lies in how the program handles negative and positive values. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of absolute values of all slimes if there are any negative values present. However, the correct approach should consider the parity (odd/even) of the number of negative values. If the number of negative values is odd, the program should subtract the smallest absolute value from the total sum to achieve the maximum possible value of the last slime. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-2 3 -4
```

The program would output `7` (which is `|-2| + |3| + |-4| = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9`), but the correct output should be `5` because we should subtract the smallest absolute value (2) from the total sum (9).

To fix this, the program needs to check the number of negative values and adjust the sum accordingly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list of integers `a` and calculates a specific value based on the contents of the list. If the list contains any negative numbers, the function prints the sum of the absolute values of all elements in the list. Otherwise, it iterates through the list to find the maximum subarray sum where the sum is calculated as the total sum of the list minus a specific element, considering the condition that the current element is less than its adjacent elements. The function then prints the maximum value found. The function ensures that the input list `a` meets the constraints of having a length between 1 and 500,000 and each element being between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\). If these constraints are violated, the function does not execute properly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
