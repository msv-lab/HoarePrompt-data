`pos` is assigned the value `n - neg`. The value of `n` is an integer input between 1 and 500,000, and `neg` is the number of negative integers in list `a`. The value of `pos` is calculated as `n - neg`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 500,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive), `neg` is the number of negative integers in list `a`, `pos` is `n - neg`.**
