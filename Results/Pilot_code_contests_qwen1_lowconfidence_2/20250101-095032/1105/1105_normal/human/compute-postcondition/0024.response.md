Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\); `neg` is 0; `pos` is `n`; `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `s - a[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]`; `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`.***
