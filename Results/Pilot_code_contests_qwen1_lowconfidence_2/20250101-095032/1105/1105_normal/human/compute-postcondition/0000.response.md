The given code defines a lambda function named `rints` which reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string into an integer. This lambda function does not modify any existing variables but rather provides a new way to read and convert input data.

Since the lambda function itself does not execute any operations that change the values of `n` or `a`, the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
