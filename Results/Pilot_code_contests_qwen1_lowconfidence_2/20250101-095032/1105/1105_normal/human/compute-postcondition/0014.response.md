Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive), `neg` is 0, `pos` is `n`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `s - a[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]`, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and for all valid indices `i`, `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`.***
