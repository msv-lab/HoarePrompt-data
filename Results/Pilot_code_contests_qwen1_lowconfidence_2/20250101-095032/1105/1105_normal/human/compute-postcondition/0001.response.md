The code reads two inputs from the user: the first input is assigned to `n` and is converted to an integer, and the second input is assigned to `a` and is expected to be a list of `n` integers. The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\,000\) and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). After executing the code, the values of `n` and `a` are updated according to the inputs provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 500,000 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive)**.
