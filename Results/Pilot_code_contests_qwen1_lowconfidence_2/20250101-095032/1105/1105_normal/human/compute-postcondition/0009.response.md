Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive), `neg` is 0, `pos` is `n`, `ans` is 0, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`. The current index `i` is valid (0 â‰¤ i < n) and the value of `a[i]` is less than the value of `a[i - 1]`***
