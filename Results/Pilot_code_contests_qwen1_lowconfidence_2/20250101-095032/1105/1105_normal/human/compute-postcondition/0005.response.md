The code calculates the sum of the absolute values of all elements in the list `a`. This does not modify any of the existing variables, but rather prints the result. The variables `n`, `a`, `neg`, and `pos` remain unchanged, but now there is a printed output which is the sum of the absolute values of the elements in list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 500,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive), `neg` is the number of negative integers in list `a`, `pos` is `n - neg`, a new value is printed which is the sum of the absolute values of all elements in list `a`.**
