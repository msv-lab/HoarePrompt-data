Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive), `neg` is 0, `pos` is `n`, `ans` is the maximum value between `max(0, s - a[i - 1])` when `a[i] < a[i - 1]` and the value of `ans` when `a[i] >= a[i - 1]`, and `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.***
