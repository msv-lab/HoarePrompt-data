Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\) (inclusive), `neg` is 0, `pos` is `n`, `ans` is the maximum value between its original value and `s - a[i - 1]` if `i > 0` and `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and `i` is incremented.***

Explanation:
- In the if part, if `i > 0` and `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `s - a[i - 1]`.
- In the else part, `ans` remains unchanged unless `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `s - a[i + 1]`.
- Both parts ensure that `i` is incremented at the end of the execution.
