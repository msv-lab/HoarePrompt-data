Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive), `neg` is 0, `pos` is `n`, `ans` is 0, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and for all valid indices `i`, `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`. The current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`***
