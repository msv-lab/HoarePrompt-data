Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 500,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\) (inclusive), `neg` is the number of negative integers in list `a`, `pos` is `n - neg`. If `neg` is greater than 0, the sum of the absolute values of all elements in list `a` is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum value between its original value and either `s - a[i - 1]` if `i > 0` and `a[i] < a[i - 1]` or `s - a[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1` and `a[i] < a[i + 1]` for all valid `i`, where `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, and `ans` is printed.**
