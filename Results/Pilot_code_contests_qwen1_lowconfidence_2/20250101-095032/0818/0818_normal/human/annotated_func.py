#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, mx is an integer that will be computed as the maximum bit length difference needed to make the array non-decreasing.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        mx = 0

            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
                a[i] = p

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where every element except the last one is replaced by the last element of the list, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of `(p - a[i])` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `p` is equal to the last element of the list `a`, and `func_2(mx)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list `a` to find the maximum bit length difference needed to make the array non-decreasing. This is achieved by ensuring that each element in the array is greater than or equal to the previous element, adjusting values when necessary. After processing each element, it calls another function `func_2` with the computed maximum bit length difference `mx`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` and `n` are positive integers, `a` is a list where each element except the last one is replaced by the last element of the list, `mx` is the maximum bit length difference needed to make the array non-decreasing, and `func_2(mx)` has been called. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists with only one element, which would result in `mx` being 0 since no adjustments are needed. The function does not return any value, but `func_2(mx)` is called, implying that the value of `mx` is passed to another function for further processing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no precondition provided for the function `func_2` based on the problem description and the given code snippet. The function does not take any arguments related to the problem and is likely a utility function for printing.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is an iterable where each element has been converted to a string and concatenated with the separator `sep` (which is a space by default) except for the last element.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable where each element has been converted to a string and concatenated with the separator `sep` (which is a space by default) except for the last element, and a newline character `\n` has been written to `sys.stdout`. If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the output buffer is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints the elements of an iterable (`args`) to a specified output stream (`file`), using a specified separator (`sep`). By default, `sep` is a space character and `file` is `sys.stdout`. It also handles the `end` parameter to add a trailing character to the output, and the `flush` parameter to flush the output buffer. After executing the function, the elements of `args` have been converted to strings and concatenated with `sep`, with the final element not followed by `sep`. A trailing character specified by `end` is added, and if `flush` is `True`, the output buffer is flushed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include passing non-string elements in `args`, and specifying invalid types for `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush`.
