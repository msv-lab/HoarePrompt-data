t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of integers of length n where each integer satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
