Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of seconds required to make the array non-decreasing. The function `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the required operations as described in the problem statement.

Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that we can modify multiple elements in a single second by adding \(2^{x-1}\). Instead, it tries to adjust the array by making sure no element is less than its previous element, which is a more relaxed condition than the requirement to make the array non-decreasing as fast as possible.

For instance, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4
```

- For the first test case, the initial array is `[1, 7, 6, 5]`. To make this array non-decreasing, we need to ensure that each element is greater than or equal to the previous one. The correct approach would involve identifying the largest gap and filling it with the necessary power of two. In this case, the largest gap is between 6 and 5, which requires adding \(2^2 = 4\) to 5, resulting in the array `[1, 7, 6, 9]`, which is non-decreasing in 2 seconds. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

- For the second test case, the array is already non-decreasing, so the output should be 0, which is handled correctly.

- For the third test case, the array is `[0, -4]`. To make it non-decreasing, we need to add \(2^2 = 4\) to `-4`, resulting in the array `[0, 0]`, which is non-decreasing in 3 seconds. The current implementation does not handle this correctly either.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in several cases.
