Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required to make the array nondecreasing. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4
```

For the third test case `[0, -4]`, the program should output `3` because we need to wait until the 3rd second to make `-4` nonnegative. However, the current implementation only checks if the current element is less than the previous element and calculates the maximum bit length difference without considering the need to wait multiple seconds to make all elements nonnegative simultaneously. This means the program might not handle cases where multiple elements need to be adjusted in later seconds.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the cumulative effect of the operations across all elements, ensuring that all elements can be made nonnegative in the minimum number of seconds.
