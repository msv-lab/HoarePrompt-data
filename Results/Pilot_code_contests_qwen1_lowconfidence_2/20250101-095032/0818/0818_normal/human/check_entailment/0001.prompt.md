You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:

  * Select some distinct indices i_{1}, i_{2}, …, i_{k} which are between 1 and n inclusive, and add 2^{x-1} to each corresponding position of a. Formally, a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1} for j = 1, 2, …, k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all.



You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.

Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} ≤ a_{2} ≤ … ≤ a_{n}.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 10^{5}.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, …, a_{n} (-10^{9} ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make a nondecreasing.

Example

Input


3
4
1 7 6 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
0 -4


Output


2
0
3

Note

In the first test case, if you select indices 3, 4 at the 1-st second and 4 at the 2-nd second, then a will become [1, 7, 7, 8]. There are some other possible ways to make a nondecreasing in 2 seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, a is already nondecreasing, so answer is 0.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first 2 seconds and select index 2 at the 3-rd second, a will become [0, 0].
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        mx = 0
        p = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] < p:
                mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
                a[i] = p
            p = a[i]
        func_2(mx)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
