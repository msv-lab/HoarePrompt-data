t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, mx is an integer that will be computed as the maximum bit length difference needed to make the array non-decreasing.
