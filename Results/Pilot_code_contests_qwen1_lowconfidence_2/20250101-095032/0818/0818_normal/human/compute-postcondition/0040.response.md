Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `p` is `a[k + 1]`.
   - `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`. If `a[i] < p`, then `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `0`. Otherwise, `mx` remains the same as its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `k + 2`.

4. **Determine the New State of `p`:**
   - `p` is defined as `a[k + 1]` at the end of the previous iteration, so it does not change with the loop increment.

5. **Determine the New State of `mx`:**
   - `mx` is updated based on the condition involving `p` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, we now need to consider `a[k + 2]` for the next iteration.
   - The update rule for `mx` is:
     - If `a[k + 2] < p`, then `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `0`.
     - Otherwise, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[k + 2]`.

6. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `k + 2`.
   - `p` remains `a[k + 1]`.
   - `mx` is updated based on the new value of `a[k + 2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[k + 2]`. If `a[k + 2] < p`, then `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `0`. Otherwise, `mx` remains the same as its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[k + 2]`.**
