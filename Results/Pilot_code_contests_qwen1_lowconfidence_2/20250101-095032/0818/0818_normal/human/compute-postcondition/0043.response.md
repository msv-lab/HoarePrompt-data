Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`. If `a[i] < p`, then `mx` is set to 0; otherwise, `mx` remains the same as its original value or the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`, whichever is larger.***
