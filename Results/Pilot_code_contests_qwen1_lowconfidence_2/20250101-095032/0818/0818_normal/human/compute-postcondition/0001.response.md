The code snippet modifies the values of `sep` and `file` by popping them from `kwargs`. Since no initial values are provided for `kwargs`, we consider the default values for `sep` and `file` as defined in the code. 

- `sep` is assigned the value `' '` if `'sep'` is not present in `kwargs`, otherwise it retains the value from `kwargs`.
- `file` is assigned the value `sys.stdout` if `'file'` is not present in `kwargs`, otherwise it retains the value from `kwargs`.

Since there is no initial state provided, we assume `kwargs` is an empty dictionary, which means both `sep` and `file` will take their default values.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`**
