According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop starts from `i = 1` and continues as long as `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's summarize the required states:

- `a` is a new list of integers from input (no change needed here as it's already given).
- `p` is the first element of the list `a` (no change needed here as it's already given).
- `mx` is 0 (no change needed here as it's already given).
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

So, the final state after adjustment is:

State: **`a` is a new list of integers from input, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `mx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
