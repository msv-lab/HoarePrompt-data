Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is an iterable where each element has been converted to a string and concatenated with the separator `sep` (which is a space by default) except for the last element.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sep` remains unchanged as it is only used within the loop and its initial value is a space character.
- The variable `file` also remains unchanged as it is set to `sys.stdout` and is only used within the loop.
- The variable `at_start` becomes `False` after the first iteration and remains `False` thereafter since the loop sets `at_start` to `False` in every iteration.
- The variable `args` must be a non-empty iterable. After the loop completes, each element in `args` has been converted to a string and written to `sys.stdout` with a separator `sep` (a space by default) except for the last element, which is written without a trailing separator.

This ensures that all elements of `args` are printed to `sys.stdout` separated by spaces, except for the last one which is not followed by any separator.
