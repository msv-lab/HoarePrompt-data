`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character `' '` in this case) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the value of `sys.stdout` has a space character written to it.**
