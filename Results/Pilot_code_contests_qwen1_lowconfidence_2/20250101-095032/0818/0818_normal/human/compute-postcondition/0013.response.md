`at_start` is reassigned the value `False`. The value of `sep`, `file`, and `x` remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is converted to a string and written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is converted to a string and written to `sys.stdout`**
