`a[i]` is assigned the value of `p`. This updates the element at index `i` in the list `a` to be `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `p`, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `p` is an integer, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`).**
