Functionality: **This function prints the elements of an iterable (`args`) to a specified output stream (`file`), using a specified separator (`sep`). By default, `sep` is a space character and `file` is `sys.stdout`. It also handles the `end` parameter to add a trailing character to the output, and the `flush` parameter to flush the output buffer. After executing the function, the elements of `args` have been converted to strings and concatenated with `sep`, with the final element not followed by `sep`. A trailing character specified by `end` is added, and if `flush` is `True`, the output buffer is flushed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include passing non-string elements in `args`, and specifying invalid types for `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush`.**
