The code writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. This means that the string `\n` (a newline character) will be written to the standard output. The variables `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable where each element has been converted to a string and concatenated with the separator `sep` (which is a space by default) except for the last element, and a newline character `\n` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
