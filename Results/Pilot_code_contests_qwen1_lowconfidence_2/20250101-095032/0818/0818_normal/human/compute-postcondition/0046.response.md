The function `func_2(mx)` is called with the argument `mx`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine what changes, if any, this function will make to the variables. The variables `a`, `p`, and `mx` retain their initial values, and no new assignments are made to them within the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `p` is the last element of the list `a`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`) for all `i` such that `a[i] < p`.**
