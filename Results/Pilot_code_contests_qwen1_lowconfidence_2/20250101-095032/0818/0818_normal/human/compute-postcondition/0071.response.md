The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). Additionally, `mx` is an integer that will be computed as the maximum bit length difference needed to make the array non-decreasing.

The output of the function is determined by the value of `mx`, which is the maximum bit length difference needed to make the array non-decreasing.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, and returns an integer `mx` representing the maximum bit length difference needed to make the array non-decreasing.**
