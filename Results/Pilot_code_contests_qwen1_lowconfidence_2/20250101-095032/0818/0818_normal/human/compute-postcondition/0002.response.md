The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of the other variables (`sep` and `file`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `at_start` along with the unchanged values of `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
