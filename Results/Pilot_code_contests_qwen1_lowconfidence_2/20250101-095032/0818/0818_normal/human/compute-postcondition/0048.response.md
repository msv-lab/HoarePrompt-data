The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `p`, and `mx`) remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `p` is the last element of the list `a`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`) for all `i` such that `a[i] < p`, `n` is an input integer**
