According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `args` iterable. For the loop to execute again, `args` must contain at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still be a non-empty iterable, but it must now have at least one more element left to iterate over. This means `args` must have at least two elements in it for the loop to proceed.

State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two elements**
