Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sep` is a space character `' '`.
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - `x` is converted to a string and written to `sys.stdout`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - In each iteration, `x` is taken from `args` and is converted to a string and written to `sys.stdout`.
   - `sep` is used as the separator between elements when writing to `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is set to `False` at the start of the loop and remains `False` unless specifically changed within the loop.

4. **States to Be Adjusted:**
   - `sep` will remain `' '` (space) unless explicitly changed within the loop.
   - `file` will remain `sys.stdout` unless explicitly changed within the loop.
   - `at_start` will remain `False` because the loop has already processed at least one element.
   - `x` will be the next element from `args` in the current iteration.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `sep` is still `' '` (space).
   - `file` is still `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is still `False`.
   - `x` will be the next element from `args`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element from `args`**.
