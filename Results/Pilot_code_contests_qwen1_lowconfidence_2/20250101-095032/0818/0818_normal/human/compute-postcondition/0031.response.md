`mx` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the bit length of the difference between `p` and `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is less than `p`, the expression `(p - a[i])` results in a positive integer. The bit length of this positive integer is calculated and compared with the current value of `mx`. The value of `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the calculated bit length.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `p` is an integer, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `p` is an integer, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`).**
