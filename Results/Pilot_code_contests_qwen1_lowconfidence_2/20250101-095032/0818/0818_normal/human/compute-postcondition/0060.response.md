The code `a[i] = p` updates the value of `a[i]` to `p`. Since `p` is the value of `a[i]`, updating `a[i]` to `p` does not change the value of `a[i]`. Therefore, the value of `a[i]` remains the same, which is `p`.

The states of the other variables (`mx` and `n`) are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `a[i]` is `p`, `mx` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
