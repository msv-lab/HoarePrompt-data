The code `a[i] = p` updates the value of `a[i]` to `p`. Given that `a[i]` was initially `p`, this assignment does not change the value of `a[i]`. The other variables (`mx`, `p`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a[i]` is `p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is equal to `a[i]`, and the value of `n` must remain greater than 2 with `i` being 2**
