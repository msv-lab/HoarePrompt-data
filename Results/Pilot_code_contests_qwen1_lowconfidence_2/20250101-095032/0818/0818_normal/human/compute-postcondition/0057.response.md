The code snippet `p = a[i]` updates the value of `p` to the current value of `a[i]`. Since `a` is a list of integers, `a[i]` refers to an element in the list `a`. The value of `p` is now set to this element. However, without knowing the specific value of `a[i]` or the current value of `p`, we can only say that `p` is updated to `a[i]`.

Other variables (`a`, `mx`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `p` is the value of `a[i]`, `mx` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.**
