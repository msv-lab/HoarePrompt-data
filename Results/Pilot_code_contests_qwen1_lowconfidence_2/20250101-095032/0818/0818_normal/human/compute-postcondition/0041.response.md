The initial state includes:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `p` is `a[k + 1]`.
- `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[k + 2]`. If `a[k + 2] < p`, then `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `0`. Otherwise, `mx` remains the same as its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[k + 2]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
mx = max(mx, (p - a[i]).bit_length())
```

Let's break this down:
- `i` is defined as `k + 2`.
- `p` is defined as `a[k + 1]`.
- The expression `(p - a[i])` calculates the difference between `p` and `a[i]`.
- `.bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent the given integer in binary.

The `max(mx, ...)` function will update `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `(p - a[i]).bit_length()`. 

Given that the exact values of `a`, `k`, and `p` are not specified, let's consider the general case:
- If `p - a[i]` is non-negative, `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the bit length of `p - a[i]`.
- If `p - a[i]` is negative, `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the bit length of `- (p - a[i])`, which is the bit length of `a[i] - p`.

Thus, the new value of `mx` will be the maximum of its original value and the bit length of the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`.**
