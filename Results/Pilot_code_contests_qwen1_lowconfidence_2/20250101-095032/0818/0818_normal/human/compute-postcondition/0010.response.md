The code writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This action does not change the value of `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. The value of `args` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two elements**
