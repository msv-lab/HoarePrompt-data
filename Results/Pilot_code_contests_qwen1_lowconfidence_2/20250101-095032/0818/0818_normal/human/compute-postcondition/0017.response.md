`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. Since `sys.stdout` is the standard output, this effectively prints `x`. The value of `sep` remains a space character `' '`, `file` remains `sys.stdout`, `at_start` remains `False`, and `x` is now the next element from `args` (since it was just used). 

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element from `args`, and `sys.stdout` contains the printed value of `x`.**
