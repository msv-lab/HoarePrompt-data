The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`sep`, `file`, `x`, and the content of `sys.stdout`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element from `args`, and `sys.stdout` contains the printed value of `x`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element from `args`, and `sys.stdout` contains the printed value of `x`.**
