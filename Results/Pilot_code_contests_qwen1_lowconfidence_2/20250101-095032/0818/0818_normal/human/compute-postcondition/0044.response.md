`p` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `k + 2`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, and `mx` is determined based on the condition involving `p` and `a[i]`.

Since the code only updates the value of `p` without affecting `mx`, `a[k + 1]`, `k`, or `i`, the value of `p` changes to `a[i]`, which is `a[k + 2]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `p` is now `a[k + 2]`
- `mx` remains as the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `p` (which was `a[k + 1]`) and `a[i]` (which is now `a[k + 2]`).

The output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `p` is `a[k + 2]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k + 2]`.**
