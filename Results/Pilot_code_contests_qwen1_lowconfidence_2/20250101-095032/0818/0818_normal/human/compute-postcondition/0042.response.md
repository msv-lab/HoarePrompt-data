`a[i]` is assigned the value of `p`. The value of `i` is `k + 2`, and `p` is `a[k + 1]`. The value of `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is now equal to `p`, the value of `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its original value and the bit length of the absolute difference between `p` and `p`, which is 0. Therefore, `mx` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**
