The code `p = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to `p`. Given the initial state where `a[i]` is `p`, this assignment does not change the value of `p` because `a[i]` is already equal to `p`. The values of `mx`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a[i]` is `p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is equal to `a[i]`, and the value of `n` must remain greater than 2 with `i` being 2.**
