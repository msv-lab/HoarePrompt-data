Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list `a`.
   - `p` is equal to `a[i]`.
   - `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n-1` (inclusive).

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k` where `1 â‰¤ k < n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be `k + 1`.

5. **Updating the Values:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `k + 1`.
   - `p` remains the same as it is dependent on the current value of `i` in the list `a`.
   - `mx` remains the same unless the new value of `p` (which is now `a[k + 1]`) causes a change in `mx`.

6. **New States:**
   - `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `p` will be `a[k + 1]`.
   - `mx` will be the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`a[k + 1] - a[k + 1]`), which simplifies to the original value of `mx`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `p` is `a[k + 1]`.
- `mx` remains unchanged.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`)**.
