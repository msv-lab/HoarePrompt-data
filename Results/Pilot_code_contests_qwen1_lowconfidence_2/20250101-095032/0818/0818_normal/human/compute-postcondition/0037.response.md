The code assigns the value of `p` to `a[i]`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `k + 1`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `0`. Since `a[i]` is now set to `p`, the value of `a[k + 1]` changes from its original value to `p`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[k + 1]` is now `p`; `i` is `k + 1`; `p` is `a[k + 1]`; `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `0`**
