`p` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, which means `p` now holds the first element of the list `a`. The value of `a` remains the same, `mx` is still 0, and `n` is an input integer. The output state is: `a` is a new list of integers from input, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `mx` is 0, `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers from input, `p` is the first element of the list `a`, `mx` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
