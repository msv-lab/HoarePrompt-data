Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `p` is `a[k + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`. If `a[i] < p`, then `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `0`. Otherwise, `mx` remains the same as its original value and the absolute difference between `p` and `a[i]`.***
