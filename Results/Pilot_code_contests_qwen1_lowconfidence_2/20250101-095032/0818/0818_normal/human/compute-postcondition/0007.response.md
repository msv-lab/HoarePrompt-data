The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout` in this case. Since `at_start` is `False`, no additional space is written to `sys.stdout`. The values of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable.**
