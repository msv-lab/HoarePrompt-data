The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a space-separated string of integers as input and converts each element into an integer, updating the list `a`. This means that the list `a` now contains the integers entered by the user.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is the integer value entered by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers where every element except the last one is replaced by the last element of the list.
- `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of `(p - a[i])` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, where `p` is equal to the last element of the list `a`.
- `mx` is passed to `func_2`.

After executing the code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]`, the list `a` is updated with the new values, and the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers (every element except the last one is replaced by the last element of the list), `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of `(p - a[i])` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, where `p` is the last element of the list `a`, and `mx` is passed to `func_2`.**
