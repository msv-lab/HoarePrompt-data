Postcondition: **`sep` is a space character `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an iterable where each element has been converted to a string and concatenated with the separator `sep` (which is a space by default) except for the last element, and a newline character `\n` has been written to `sys.stdout`. The call to `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is made, but the current value of `flush` is unspecified.**
