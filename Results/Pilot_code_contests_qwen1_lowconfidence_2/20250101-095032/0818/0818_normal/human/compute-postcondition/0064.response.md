`p` is equal to `a[i]`, and `mx` is initially 1. The code updates `mx` to be the maximum value between `mx` and the bit length of `p - a[i]`. Since `p` is equal to `a[i]`, `p - a[i]` equals 0. The bit length of 0 is 0. So, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of 1 and 0, which remains 1.

Output State: **`a[i]` is `p`, `mx` is 1, `p` is equal to `a[i]`, and the value of `n` must remain greater than 2 with `i` being 2**
