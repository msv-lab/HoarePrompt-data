The function `func_2(mx)` is called with `mx` as an argument. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since the function call does not modify any variables or perform any operations other than potentially doing something within its own body, the variables outside of it remain unchanged. Therefore, the only thing that happens is the function call itself.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers
- `p` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `mx` is the bit length of the difference between the original value of `p` and the minimum value in the list `a` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `mx` is 0, and `n` is 0 if the loop does not execute.

Since no changes are made to the variables within the function call, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `p` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mx` is the bit length of the difference between the original value of `p` and the minimum value in the list `a` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `mx` is 0, and `n` is 0 if the loop does not execute, and `func_2(mx)` has been called.**
