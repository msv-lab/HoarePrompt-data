Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `p` is an integer, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`). If `a[i] < p`, then `a[i]` is updated to `p` and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the bit length of (`p` - `a[i]`). There is no change in `mx` if the condition `a[i] < p` is false.***
