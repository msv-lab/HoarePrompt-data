Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`
   - `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` if `t[0]` is not `False` and `maxNum` is `None` or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`
   - `i` is the next value in `index`
   - `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged
   - `ans` is `t[1]` if `t[0]` is not `False`

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `index` using `i`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be the next value in `index`.
   - The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The value of `maxNum` needs to be updated based on the new call to `func_2(x, y, z, i)` (if `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`).
   - The value of `ans` should be set to `t[1]` if `t[0]` is not `False`.

Given these requirements, let's determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `i` will be the next value in `index`.
- `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.
- `maxNum` will be updated based on the result of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` if `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`.
- `ans` will be set to `t[1]` if `t[0]` is not `False`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and `index`, we can only specify the necessary conditions.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**

State: **`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` if `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`, `i` is the next value in `index`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and `ans` is `t[1]` if `t[0]` is not `False`**
