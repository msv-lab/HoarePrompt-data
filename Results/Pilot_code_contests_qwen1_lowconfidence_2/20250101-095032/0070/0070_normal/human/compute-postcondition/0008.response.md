According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `index`. At the end of the last iteration, `maxNum` is now equal to the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `index` must contain at least one element, and `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `index`.
2. For each element `i` in `index`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`.
3. If the first element of `t` is greater than `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to this new value and `ans` is set to the second element of `t`. Otherwise, the original values of `maxNum` and `ans` remain unchanged.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `maxNum` is equal to the first element of `t`.
- `ans` is the second element of `t`.
- `index` must contain at least one element.
- `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `index` must have at least two elements because it needs to process another element `i`. Therefore, the first element of `t` from the next call of `func_1(x, y, z, i)` will be compared with `maxNum`.

State: **`maxNum` is now equal to the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `index` must contain at least two elements, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
