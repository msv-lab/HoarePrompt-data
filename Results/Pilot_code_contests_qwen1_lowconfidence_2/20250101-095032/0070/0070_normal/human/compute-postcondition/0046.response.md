`t` is assigned the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`. This means `t` now holds whatever `func_2(x, y, z, i)` returns. The value of `t` could be a tuple `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are the outputs of `func_2`.

- If `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]`.
- If `t[0]` is not `False`, then `ans` is set to `t[1]`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` if `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`, `ans` is `t[1]` if `t[0]` is not `False`, and `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
