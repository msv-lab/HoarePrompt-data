Postcondition: ***`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is `t[1]`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged. If `maxNum` is `None` or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
