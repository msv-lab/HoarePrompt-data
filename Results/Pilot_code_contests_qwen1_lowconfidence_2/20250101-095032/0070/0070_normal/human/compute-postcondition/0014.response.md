The code assigns the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)` to the variable `t`. The function `func_1` returns two values, where `maxNum` is the first element and `ans` is the second element of the return value from `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`, and `ans` is the second element of the return value from `func_1(x, y, z, i)`. After executing the code, `t` will contain the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, which means `t` will have both `maxNum` and `ans` as its first and second elements respectively. The other variables (`maxNum`, `ans`, `index`, `new_i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`, `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `index` contains at least two elements, `new_i` is the next element in `index`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
