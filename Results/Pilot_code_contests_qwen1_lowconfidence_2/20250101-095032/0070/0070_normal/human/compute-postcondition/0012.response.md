Postcondition: **`maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `index` contains at least two elements, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, if the first element of `t` is greater than `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to the first element of `t`; otherwise, `maxNum` remains unchanged.**
