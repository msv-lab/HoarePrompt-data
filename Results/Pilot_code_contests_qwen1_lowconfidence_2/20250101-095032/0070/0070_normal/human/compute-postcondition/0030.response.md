The code initializes two variables: `maxNum` is set to `None` and `ans` is set to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `maxNum` is `None`, `ans` is an empty string**
