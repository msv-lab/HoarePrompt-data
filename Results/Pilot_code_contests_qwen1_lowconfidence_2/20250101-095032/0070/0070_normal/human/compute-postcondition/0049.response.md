Postcondition: ***`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` if `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`, `ans` is `t[1]` if `t[0]` is not `False`, and `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `maxNum` is `None` or `t[0] > maxNum`, these updates occur. Otherwise, the values of `maxNum` and `ans` remain as they were before the if-else block.***
