`maxNum` is assigned the value of `t[0]`. According to the initial state, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, and `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`. Therefore, after the assignment, `maxNum` will be updated to the value of `t[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is `t[1]`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `maxNum` is equal to `t[0]`.**
