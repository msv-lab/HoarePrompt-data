`ans` is assigned the value of `t[1]`, which is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`, `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `index` contains at least two elements, `new_i` is the next element in `index`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of `t`**
