The code `t = func_1(x, y, z, i)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i`. The values of `maxNum`, `ans`, and `index` are not affected by this line of code. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine the value of `t` or how `maxNum`, `ans`, or `index` might be changed. Therefore, the only information we can confidently include in the output state is the call to the function.

Output State: **`maxNum` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `index` must contain at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
