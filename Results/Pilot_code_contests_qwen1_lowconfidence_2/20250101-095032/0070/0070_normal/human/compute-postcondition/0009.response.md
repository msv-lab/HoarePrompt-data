The code assigns the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)` to `t`. The values of `maxNum` and `ans` are derived from the initial state of `t`, where `maxNum` is the first element of `t` and `ans` is the second element of `t`. After executing `t = func_1(x, y, z, i)`, the new values of `maxNum` and `ans` will be the first and second elements of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, respectively. The value of `index` remains unchanged since it was not modified by the code.

Output State: **`maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `index` contains at least two elements, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
