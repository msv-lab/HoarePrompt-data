Output State: **`maxNum` is the maximum value among all the first elements returned by `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`, `ans` is the second element of the `t` corresponding to the maximum first element, `index` is the list of indices, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in `index`.
- For each iteration, it calls `func_1(x, y, z, i)` and assigns the result to `t`.
- If the first element of `t` (which we denote as `t[0]`) is greater than the current `maxNum`, `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` and `ans` is updated to `t[1]`.
- After all iterations, `maxNum` will hold the highest value among all `t[0]` values, and `ans` will hold the corresponding `t[1]`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `index` is empty), then `maxNum` remains `0` and `ans` remains an empty string.

This ensures that the final values of `maxNum` and `ans` reflect the maximum first element returned by `func_1(x, y, z, i)` and its corresponding second element, respectively, across all elements in `index`.
