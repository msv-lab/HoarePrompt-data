`ans` is assigned the value of the second element of `t`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and the first element of `t` is greater than the current value of `maxNum`, the first element of `t` is equal to `maxNum`. Therefore, the second element of `t` is assigned to `ans`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxNum` is now equal to the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `index` must contain at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
