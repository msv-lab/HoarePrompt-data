`ans` is assigned the value of `t[1]`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `t[1]` is the second element of the return value, which is `ans` according to the initial state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `index` contains at least two elements, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of `t`**
