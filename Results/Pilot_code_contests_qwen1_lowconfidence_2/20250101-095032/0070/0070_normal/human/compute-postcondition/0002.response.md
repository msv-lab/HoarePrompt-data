According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `index`. The loop will execute if `index` contains at least one element. Before the loop starts, `maxNum` is 0 and `ans` is an empty string. These variables do not affect the condition of the loop's execution, but we need to ensure that `index` has at least one element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `index` must contain at least one element, and the initial values of `maxNum` and `ans` remain as they are.

State: **`maxNum` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `index` must contain at least one element**
