The code assigns `t[1]` to `ans`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, and `ans` is set to `t[1]` only if `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`, the value of `ans` is now `t[1]` if these conditions are met. The other variables (`t`, `maxNum`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` if `t[0]` is not `False` and `t[0]` is greater than the current `maxNum`, `ans` is `t[1]` if `t[0]` is not `False`, and `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
