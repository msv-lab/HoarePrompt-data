Postcondition: **`maxNum` is now equal to the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `index` must contain at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`. If the first element of `t` is greater than `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to this new value and `ans` is set to the second element of `t`. Otherwise, the original values of `maxNum` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
