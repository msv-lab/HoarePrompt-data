Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, each being a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0]. Based on certain conditions, the function performs the following actions and returns one of the following outcomes:

- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, the function iterates over the `index` list and calls `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`. It then finds the tuple `t` with the maximum first element and returns the second element of this tuple.
- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is exactly 1, it checks if `x` is 1. If `x` is 1, it returns '1^y^z'. Otherwise, it checks if `y` is 1. If `y` is 1, it returns '1^x^z'. In all other cases, it returns `z` raised to the power of (`x` raised to the power of `y`).
- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is greater than or equal to 1, the function iterates over the `index` list and calls `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`. It keeps track of the maximum first element returned by `func_2` and the corresponding string value. After the loop, it returns the string value corresponding to the maximum first element.

In all cases, the function ensures that the inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0].**

This summary covers all potential cases and includes the actions performed by the function based on the given conditions and the actual code.
