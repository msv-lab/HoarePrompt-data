Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0], `maxNum` is the maximum value returned by `func_2(x, y, z, i)` among all iterations, `ans` is the corresponding string value returned by `func_2(x, y, z, i)` when `maxNum` is updated, `i` is the last value in `index` that caused `maxNum` to be updated, and `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` during the last iteration.**
