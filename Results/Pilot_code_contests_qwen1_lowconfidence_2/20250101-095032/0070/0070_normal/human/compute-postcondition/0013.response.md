Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`.
   - `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`.
   - `index` contains at least two elements.
   - `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `index`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, `t` is updated to the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`.
   - If the first element of `t` (let's call it `newMaxNum`) is greater than `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to `newMaxNum`.
   - Otherwise, `maxNum` remains unchanged.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume that after the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 (since we're iterating over `index`).
   - The new `i` is the next element in `index`.
   - `t` is now the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - `maxNum` may or may not have changed depending on the result of `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body did not update it.
   - `index` is still valid and contains at least two elements, but the current `i` is the next element in `index`.

6. **New State**:
   - `maxNum` is either the same as before or updated based on the result of `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`.
   - `ans` remains the same as the initial state.
   - `index` contains at least two elements, and the current `i` is the next element in `index`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`, `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `index` contains at least two elements, `new_i` is the next element in `index`**.

To simplify:

State: **`maxNum` is the first element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, new_i)`, `ans` is the second element of the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `index` contains at least two elements, `new_i` is the next element in `index`**.
