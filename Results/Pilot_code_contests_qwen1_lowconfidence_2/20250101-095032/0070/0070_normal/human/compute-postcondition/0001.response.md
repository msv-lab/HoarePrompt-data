The code initializes two variables: `maxNum` to 0 and `ans` to an empty string. Since the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, none of these variables can affect the initialization of `maxNum` and `ans`. Therefore, the values of `maxNum` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxNum` is 0, `ans` is an empty string**
