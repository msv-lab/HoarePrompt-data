The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each of these parameters is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point and lies in the range [0.1, 200.0]. The function has multiple return points based on certain conditions:

- Case_1: The function returns the second element of the tuple `t` that corresponds to the maximum first element returned by `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`.
- Case_2: The function returns '1^y^z', given that `x` is 1 and the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is 1, which implies that `y` and `z` must also be 1.
- Case_3: The function returns '1^x^z'.
- Case_4: The function returns `z` raised to the power of (`x` raised to the power of `y`).
- Case_5: The function returns `ans`, which is the string value returned by `func_2(x, y, z, i)` when `maxNum` was last updated.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0] and return one of the following based on specific conditions:

- The second element of the tuple `t` corresponding to the maximum first element from `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`.
- '1^y^z' if `x` is 1 and the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is 1.
- '1^x^z'.
- `z` raised to the power of (`x` raised to the power of `y`).
- The string value returned by `func_2(x, y, z, i)` when `maxNum` was last updated.
