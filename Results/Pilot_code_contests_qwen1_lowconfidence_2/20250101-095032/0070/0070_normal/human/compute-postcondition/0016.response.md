The code `maxNum = t[0]` assigns the first element of the tuple `t` to the variable `maxNum`. The variable `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `ans` is the second element of `t`. Therefore, `maxNum` is assigned the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`maxNum` is the value of `ans`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `index` contains at least two elements, `new_i` is the next element in `index`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
