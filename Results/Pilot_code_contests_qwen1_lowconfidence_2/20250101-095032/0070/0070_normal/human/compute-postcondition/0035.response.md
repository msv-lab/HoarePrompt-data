`ans` is assigned the value of `t[1]`. According to the initial state, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, and `t[0]` is not False, meaning `func_2` returned a non-False value. Additionally, either `maxNum` is None or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the value of `t[0]` is still greater than `maxNum` if `maxNum` was not None.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is `t[1]`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and either `maxNum` is None or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`.

Output State: **`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is `t[1]`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and either `maxNum` is None or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`.**
