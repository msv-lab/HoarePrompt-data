To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and how they apply to the loop's execution.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`.
   - `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - If `t[0]` is not `False`, then `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` if `maxNum` is `None` or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`.
   - Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the variable `i` in `index`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be such that it is within the bounds of `index`.
   - The specific value of `i` used in the current iteration is not directly relevant to the next iteration; what matters is the condition under which the loop continues.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged, their values will stay the same.
   - `t` will be the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the new value of `i` in the next iteration.
   - `maxNum` might change depending on the result of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the new `i`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to adjust as follows:
- `t` will be the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the new value of `i`.
- `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `maxNum` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the new value of `t[0]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `i` (which is part of `index` but not specified), and the potential update to `maxNum`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` where `i` is the next value in `index`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `maxNum` is either unchanged or updated if `t[0]` is not `False` and `maxNum` is `None` or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`.**
