The code `maxNum = t[0]` assigns the first element of the list `t` to the variable `maxNum`. According to the initial state, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `maxNum` is initially equal to the first element of `t`. After executing this line, `maxNum` will be updated to the first element of `t`.

Output State: **`maxNum` is now equal to the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `index` must contain at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
