You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:

  1. a1 = xyz; 
  2. a2 = xzy; 
  3. a3 = (xy)z; 
  4. a4 = (xz)y; 
  5. a5 = yxz; 
  6. a6 = yzx; 
  7. a7 = (yx)z; 
  8. a8 = (yz)x; 
  9. a9 = zxy; 
  10. a10 = zyx; 
  11. a11 = (zx)y; 
  12. a12 = (zy)x. 



Let m be the maximum of all the ai, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that ac = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that ac.

Input

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Output

Find the maximum value of expression among xyz, xzy, (xy)z, (xz)y, yxz, yzx, (yx)z, (yz)x, zxy, zyx, (zx)y, (zy)x and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

xyz should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (xy)z should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point and within the range 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and `k` is an integer. Based on the value of `k`, the function performs different calculations involving powers of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The function returns either a numerical value or a string representing the calculated power expression.

The function covers the following cases:
1. If `k` is 1, it returns \( x^{y^z} \) as a string `'x^y^z'`.
2. If `k` is 2, it returns \( x^{z^y} \) as a string `'x^z^y'`.
3. If `k` is 3 or 4, it returns \( x^{(z \times y)} \) as a numerical value and the string `'(x^y)^z'`.
4. If `k` is 5, it returns \( y^{(x^z)} \) as a string `'y^x^z'`.
5. If `k` is 6, it returns \( y^{z^x} \) as a string `'y^z^x'`.
6. If `k` is 7 or 8, it returns \( y^{(x \times z)} \) as a numerical value and the string `'(y^x)^z'`.
7. If `k` is 9, it returns \( z^{(x^y)} \) as a numerical value.
8. If `k` is 10, it returns \( z^{y^x} \) as a string `'z^y^x'`.
9. If `k` is 11 or 12, it returns \( z^{(x \times y)} \) as a numerical value and the string `'(z^x)^y'`.

If `k` does not match any of the above values, the function will return an error or an undefined state, as the function does not handle this case explicitly.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k`. These parameters are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that `0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0`, and `k` is an integer. The function returns a mathematical expression and a string based on the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k`.

- If `x > 1` and `k == 1`, it returns `z * log(y) + log(log(x))` and `'x^y^z'`.
- If `x > 1` and `k == 2`, it returns `y * log(z) + log(log(x))` and `'x^z^y'`.
- If `x > 1` and `k == 3` or `k == 4`, it returns `log(y) + log(z) + log(log(x))` and `'x^(y^z)'`.
- If `y > 1` and `k == 5`, it returns `z * log(x) + log(log(y))` and `'y^x^z'`.
- If `y > 1` and `k == 6`, it returns `x * log(z) + log(log(y))` and `'y^z^x'`.
- If `y > 1` and `k == 7` or `k == 8`, it returns `log(x) + log(z) + log(log(y))` and `'y^(x^z)'`.
- If `z > 1` and `k == 9`, it returns `y * log(x) + log(log(z))` and `'z^x^y'`.
- If `z > 1` and `k == 10`, it returns `x * log(y) + log(log(z))` and `'z^y^x'`.
- If `z > 1` and `k == 11` or `k == 12`, it returns `log(x) + log(y) + log(log(z))` and `'z^(x^y)'`.
- If none of the conditions are met, it returns `False` and an empty string.

This covers all possible cases and includes potential edge cases such as when `x`, `y`, or `z` are equal to their boundaries (`0.1` or `200.0`). The function handles the specified conditions and returns the appropriate mathematical expression and string based on the input values.

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, each being a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0]. Based on certain conditions, the function performs the following actions and returns one of the following outcomes:

- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, the function iterates over the `index` list and calls `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`. It then finds the tuple `t` with the maximum first element and returns the second element of this tuple.
- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is exactly 1, it checks if `x` is 1. If `x` is 1, it returns '1^y^z'. Otherwise, it checks if `y` is 1. If `y` is 1, it returns '1^x^z'. In all other cases, it returns `z` raised to the power of (`x` raised to the power of `y`).
- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is greater than or equal to 1, the function iterates over the `index` list and calls `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`. It keeps track of the maximum first element returned by `func_2` and the corresponding string value. After the loop, it returns the string value corresponding to the maximum first element.

In all cases, the function ensures that the inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0].



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
