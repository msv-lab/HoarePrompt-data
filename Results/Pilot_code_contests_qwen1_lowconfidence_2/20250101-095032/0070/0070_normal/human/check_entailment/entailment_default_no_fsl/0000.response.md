Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_3` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all potential cases based on the maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z`:

1. If the maximum value is less than 1, it uses `func_1` to evaluate all 12 expressions and returns the one with the maximum value.
2. If the maximum value is exactly 1, it handles specific cases where one of `x`, `y`, or `z` is 1 and returns the appropriate expression.
3. If the maximum value is greater than or equal to 1, it uses `func_2` to evaluate all 12 expressions and returns the one with the maximum value.

The code logic aligns with the problem description and output hints provided. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
