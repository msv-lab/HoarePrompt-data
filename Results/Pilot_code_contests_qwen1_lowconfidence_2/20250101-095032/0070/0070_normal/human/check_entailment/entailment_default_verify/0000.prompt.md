You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:

  1. a1 = xyz; 
  2. a2 = xzy; 
  3. a3 = (xy)z; 
  4. a4 = (xz)y; 
  5. a5 = yxz; 
  6. a6 = yzx; 
  7. a7 = (yx)z; 
  8. a8 = (yz)x; 
  9. a9 = zxy; 
  10. a10 = zyx; 
  11. a11 = (zx)y; 
  12. a12 = (zy)x. 



Let m be the maximum of all the ai, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that ac = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that ac.

Input

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Output

Find the maximum value of expression among xyz, xzy, (xy)z, (xz)y, yxz, yzx, (yx)z, (yz)x, zxy, zyx, (zx)y, (zy)x and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

xyz should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (xy)z should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the evaluation of the expressions correctly. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to handle the twelve possible expressions as described. Instead, they attempt to evaluate expressions using logarithmic properties, which is not a direct method for comparing the values of the expressions.

For instance, let's consider the following input:
```
1.1 3.4 2.5
```

The program should output the expression corresponding to the maximum value among the twelve possibilities. However, due to the complexity and the way the functions are implemented, the program might not correctly identify the maximum value and the corresponding expression.

A more appropriate approach would be to directly evaluate each of the twelve expressions and compare their values. Here's a simplified version of how this could be done:

```python
def evaluate_expression(x, y, z, expr):
    if expr == 'x^y^z':
        return x ** (y ** z)
    elif expr == 'x^z^y':
        return x ** (z ** y)
    elif expr == '(x^y)^z':
        return (x ** y) ** z
    # Add other expressions similarly

def main():
    x, y, z = map(float, input().split())
    max_value = float('-inf')
    best_expr = ''
    
    for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]:
        expr = f'expr_{i}'
        value = evaluate_expression(x, y, z, expr)
        if value > max_value:
            max_value = value
            best_expr = expr
    
    print(best_expr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This approach ensures that each expression is evaluated correctly and the maximum value is identified accurately. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect as it does not properly implement the required logic to find the maximum value among the twelve expressions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, each being a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0]. Based on certain conditions, the function performs the following actions and returns one of the following outcomes:

- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, the function iterates over the `index` list and calls `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`. It then finds the tuple `t` with the maximum first element and returns the second element of this tuple.
- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is exactly 1, it checks if `x` is 1. If `x` is 1, it returns '1^y^z'. Otherwise, it checks if `y` is 1. If `y` is 1, it returns '1^x^z'. In all other cases, it returns `z` raised to the power of (`x` raised to the power of `y`).
- If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is greater than or equal to 1, the function iterates over the `index` list and calls `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for each `i` in `index`. It keeps track of the maximum first element returned by `func_2` and the corresponding string value. After the loop, it returns the string value corresponding to the maximum first element.

In all cases, the function ensures that the inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point in the range [0.1, 200.0].+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
