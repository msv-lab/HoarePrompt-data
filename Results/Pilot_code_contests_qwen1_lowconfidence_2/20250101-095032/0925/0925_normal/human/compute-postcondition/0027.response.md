The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, it exits the loop (implied by the context). The values of the variables do not change, and we simply break out of the loop.

Output State: **`l1` is `['n', 'k']`, `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is 2, `mestot` is 1, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
