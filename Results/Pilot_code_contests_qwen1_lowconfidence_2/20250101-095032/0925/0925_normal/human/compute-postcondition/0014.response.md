Postcondition: ***`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is set to the index of 'G' in `l` if 'G' is found in `l`; otherwise, `mestok` remains `None`, `mestot` is set to the index of 'T' in `l` if 'T' is found in `l`; otherwise, `mestot` retains its original value which is the index of 'G' in `l` or `None`. If the condition `(mestok != None and mestot != None)` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur to `mestok` and `mestot`.***
