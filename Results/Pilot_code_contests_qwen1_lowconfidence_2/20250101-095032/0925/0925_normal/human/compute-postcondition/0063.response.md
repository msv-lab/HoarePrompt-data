The code `mestot = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mestot`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated value of `mestot` is `i`, while `fl`, `mestok`, `l`, and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`fl` is not `False`, `mestok` is decremented by at least 1, `mestot` is `i`, `l` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the current value of `i` + 1.**
