Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is an integer (not `None`), `mestok + k` is within the range `[mestok, len(l))`, the absolute difference between `mestok + k` and `mestot` is divisible by `k`. After executing the if-else block, `fl` is set to `True` if `l[mestok + k] == '#'`; otherwise, `fl` remains unchanged.***
