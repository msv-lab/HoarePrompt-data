The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement here would be a syntax error if not inside a loop or match-case. However, focusing on the impact on the variables, none of the variables are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `fl` is False, `mestok` is updated to `mestok + k`, `mestok + k` is within the range `[mestok, len(l))`, the absolute difference between `mestok + k` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`.**
