The code `mestot = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mestot`. Based on the initial state, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1, so `mestot` will take on this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`fl` is not `False`, `mestot` is the current value of `i`, `mestok` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1.**
