Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `fl` remains unchanged, `mestok` is updated to `mestok + k`, and `mestok + k` is within the range `[mestok, len(l))`, the absolute difference between `mestok + k` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`. If `l[i]` is '#', the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function continues without changing anything related to `fl` and `mestok`.***
