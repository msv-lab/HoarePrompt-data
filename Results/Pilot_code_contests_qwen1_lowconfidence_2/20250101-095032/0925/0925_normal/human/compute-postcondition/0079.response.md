Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing.

### Initial State Recap
- `fl` is not `False`
- `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestot` if there is no 'T'
- `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestok` if there is no 'G'
- `l` is the reversed version of its original state
- `i` is the length of the list `l`

### Loop Code Analysis
```python
for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
    if l[i] == '#':
        fl = False
        break
```

### Understanding the Loop Execution
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `mestok` to `len(l)` with a step size of `k`.
2. **Break Condition**: If `l[i] == '#'`, the loop breaks and sets `fl` to `False`.

### Final State Determination
- **Case 1: No '#' is found within the range [mestok, len(l)]**
  - The loop does not break, and `fl` remains `False`.
  - The final value of `i` will be `mestok + (len(l) - mestok) // k * k`.
  
- **Case 2: A '#' is found within the range [mestok, len(l)]**
  - The loop breaks and sets `fl` to `False`.
  - The final value of `i` will be the index where `l[i] == '#'`.

### Conclusion
Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a '#', the final value of `i` will be the smallest index within the range `[mestok, len(l))` where `l[i] == '#'`. If no such index exists, `i` will be `len(l)`.

Given these observations, the final output state can be described as follows:

**Output State:** **`mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer, `fl` is `False`, and `i` is the smallest index within the range `[mestok, len(l))` where `l[i] == '#'`, or `len(l)` if no such index exists.**
