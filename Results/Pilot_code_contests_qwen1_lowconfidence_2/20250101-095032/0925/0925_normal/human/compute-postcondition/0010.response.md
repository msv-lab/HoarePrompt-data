The code assigns the value of the index `i` to the variable `mestot`. Given that the initial state specifies `l[i]` is 'T', the index `i` is known. However, since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we will denote it as `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is set to the index of 'G' in `l` if 'G' is found in `l`; otherwise, `mestok` remains `None`, `mestot` is `i`.**
