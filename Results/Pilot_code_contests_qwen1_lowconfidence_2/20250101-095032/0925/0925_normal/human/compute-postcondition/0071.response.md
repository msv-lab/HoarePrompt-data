According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mestok`, and `len(l)`. The loop iterates from `mestok` to the end of the list `l` with a step size of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer, and `fl` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` (which starts from `mestok`) must be less than `len(l)`. Since `i` increments by `k` in each iteration, we need to ensure that the next value of `i` (i.e., `i + k`) is still within the bounds of the list.

Given that `mestok` is a valid index and `k` is a positive integer, the next value of `i` would be `mestok + k`. For the loop to continue, `mestok + k` must be less than `len(l)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `mestok` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `i` will be updated to `mestok + k`.
- The condition `mestok + k < len(l)` must hold true for the loop to continue.

State: **`mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `mestok + k`, and `i < len(l)`**
