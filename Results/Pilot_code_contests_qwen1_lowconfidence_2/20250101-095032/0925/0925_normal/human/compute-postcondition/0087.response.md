The code snippet `print('NO')` does not change any of the variables in the initial state. It only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`l1` is `['n', 'k']`, `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in `l` (or None if 'G' is not found), `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in `l` (or the index of the last 'G' if 'T' is not found or None if neither 'G' nor 'T' is found); `fl` is True. Additionally, `(abs(mestot - mestok) % k != 0)`**
