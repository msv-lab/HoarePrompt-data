The given code snippet does not include any operations that affect the variables `mestot`, `mestok`, `l`, or `i`. It only updates the value of `mestok` to be equal to `i`. Since no other operations are performed, the preconditions remain valid.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
- `mestok` is updated to be equal to `i`.
- The other variables (`mestot`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`mestok` is `i`; `mestot` will remain the same unless `l[i] == 'T'` during the next iteration; `l` must have at least one element; `i` will be the current value of `i` + 1.**
