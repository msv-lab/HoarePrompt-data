The `break` statement is executed, which does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the current loop or conditional block is exited. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is 1, `mestot` is 1, `i` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
