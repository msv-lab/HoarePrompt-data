The code `mestok = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mestok`. In the initial state, `l[i]` is 'G', meaning that `i` is the index of the substring 'G' in the string `l`. The other variables (`l1`, `l`, and `mestok`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is `i`, and `l[i]` is 'G'.**
