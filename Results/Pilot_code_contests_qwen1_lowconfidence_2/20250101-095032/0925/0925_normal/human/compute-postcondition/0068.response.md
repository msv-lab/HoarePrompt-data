The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `fl`. This does not affect the values of `mestok` or `k`, nor does it change the value of `l[mestok]`, which remains `'#'`.

Output State: **`mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer, `fl` is `False`, `l[mestok]` is `'#'`**
