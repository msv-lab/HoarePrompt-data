`mestok` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` was not explicitly given, but it is now stored in `mestok`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `fl` is not `False`, `mestot` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1; `mestok` is the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`fl` is not `False`, `mestot` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1; `mestok` is the current value of `i`**
