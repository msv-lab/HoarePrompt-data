Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is an integer (not `None`), the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, and there exists at least one valid index `i` in the range `[mestok, len(l))` where `l[i] == '#'`. The current value of `i` is such that `l[i] == '#'`***
