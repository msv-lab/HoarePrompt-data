The code assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `fl`. The values of the other variables (`mestok`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `mestok + k`, and `i < len(l)`; `fl` is `False`**
