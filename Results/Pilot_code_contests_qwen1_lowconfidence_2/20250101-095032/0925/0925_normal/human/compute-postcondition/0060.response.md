Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `fl` is not `False`.
   - `mestot` is either the current value of `i` if `l[i] == 'T'`, or it remains the same if `l[i] != 'T'`.
   - `mestok` is less than `mestok` (which implies `mestok` was decremented by at least 1).
   - `l` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is the current value of `i` + 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of `len(l)`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.
   - Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `(current value of i) + 1`.
   - `fl` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.
   - `mestot` will remain the same unless `l[i] == 'T'` during the next iteration.
   - `mestok` will be decremented by at least 1 (since it was already less than itself, it will continue to decrease).
   - `l` must still have at least one element, and no other conditions on `l` are mentioned.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `fl` is not `False`.
   - `mestot` will remain the same unless `l[i] == 'T'` during the next iteration.
   - `mestok` will be decremented by at least 1 (it could be more depending on the loop body).
   - `l` must have at least one element.
   - `i` will be the current value of `i` + 1.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`fl` is not `False`, `mestot` is the same as the previous value, `mestok` is less than the previous value, `l` must have at least one element, and `i` is the current value of `i` + 1.**
