`mestot` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is not specified, so we keep it as `i`. The states of the other variables (`fl`, `mestok`, and `l`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `fl` is not False, `mestot` is equal to `i`, `mestok` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element, and if the current value of `l[i]` is 'T', then the conditions remain as they were before the execution of the if-else block. If the current value of `l[i]` is 'T', the conditions related to 'G' do not apply.
