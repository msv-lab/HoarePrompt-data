Postcondition: ***`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in `l` (or None if 'G' is not found), `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in `l` (or the index of the last 'G' if 'T' is not found or None if neither 'G' nor 'T' is found); `fl` is True. The absolute difference between the indices of the last 'T' and the last 'G' in `l` is divisible by `k`.***
