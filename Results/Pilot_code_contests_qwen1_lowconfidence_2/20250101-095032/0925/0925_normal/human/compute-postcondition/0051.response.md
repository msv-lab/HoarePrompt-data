Postcondition: `fl` is not False, `mestot` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element, and if the current value of `l[i]` is 'G', then `mestok` is equal to `i`. If the current value of `l[i]` is not 'G', then the conditions remain as they were before the execution of the if-else block.
