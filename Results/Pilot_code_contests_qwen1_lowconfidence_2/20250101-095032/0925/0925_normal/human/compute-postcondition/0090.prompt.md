You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, representing the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump respectively. The second line is a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' denotes an empty cell, '#' denotes a cell with an obstacle, 'G' denotes the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' denotes the insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    n, k = l1[0], l1[1]
    l = raw_input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in `l` (or None if 'G' is not found), `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in `l` (or the index of the last 'G' if 'T' is not found or None if neither 'G' nor 'T' is found).
    fl = True
    if (abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0) :
        for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
        if (fl != False and mestot < mestok) :
            l = l[::-1]
            for i in range(len(l)):
                if l[i] == 'G':
                    mestok = i
                
                if l[i] == 'T':
                    mestot = i
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fl` is not `False`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestot` if there is no 'T', `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestok` if there is no 'G', `l` is the reversed version of its original state, and `i` is the length of the list `l`.
            for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
                if l[i] == '#':
                    fl = False
                    break
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *fl is not False and mestot is less than mestok. If this condition is true, no specific changes are made to the output state. Since there is no else part, the output state remains unchanged.
        if (fl == True) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`fl` is not False, `mestot` is less than `mestok`. If `fl` is True, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output remains unchanged.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`fl` is True, `mestot` is less than `mestok`. If `abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the program checks if `abs(mestot - mestok) % k != 0` and does not change the output.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts input consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a string of length `n`. It returns whether the grasshopper can reach the insect's position given the constraints and the string representation of the cells.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
