The code assigns the values from the list `l1` to the variables `n` and `k`. Initially, `l1` is `[n, k]`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive. After the assignment, `n` and `k` will hold these values directly.

Output State: **`l1` is [n, k], `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`**
