`fl` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `mestok` is updated to `mestok + k`, which means `mestok + k` is within the range `[mestok, len(l))`, and the absolute difference between `mestok + k` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`. The state of `l` and the condition regarding `fl` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `fl` is False, `mestok` is updated to `mestok + k`, `mestok + k` is within the range `[mestok, len(l))`, the absolute difference between `mestok + k` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`.**
