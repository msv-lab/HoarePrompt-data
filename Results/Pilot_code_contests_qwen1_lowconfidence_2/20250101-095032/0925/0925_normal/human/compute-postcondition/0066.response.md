Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop**: The for loop iterates over the list `l` starting from the index `mestok` up to the end of the list (`len(l)`) with a step size of `k`.

2. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States**:
   - `fl` is not `False`: This doesn't directly affect the loop's execution but might be relevant for other parts of the program.
   - `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestot` if there is no 'T'.
   - `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestok` if there is no 'G'.
   - `l` is the reversed version of its original state.
   - `i` is the length of the list `l`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the starting index `mestok` is less than the length of the list `l`.
   - The step size `k` should be a positive integer (since negative steps would reverse the direction of iteration).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `l` is the reversed version of its original state, the indices in the loop will be different from the original indices.
   - We need to ensure that `mestok` is valid (i.e., it is within the bounds of the reversed list).
   - We also need to ensure that `mestok` is less than the length of the list `l`.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `mestok` must be a valid index in the list `l`.
- `k` must be a positive integer.

The final state adjustment for the loop to execute is:
State: **`mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer**.
