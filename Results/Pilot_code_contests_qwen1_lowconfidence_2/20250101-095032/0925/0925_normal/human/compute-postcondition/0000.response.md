The code reads two integers from the input and splits them into a list using `map` and `int`. These integers represent `n` and `k`. The original string is not modified, and the list `l1` is created from the input.

Output State: **`l1` is [n, k], where n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n-1 inclusive; the original string remains unchanged**
