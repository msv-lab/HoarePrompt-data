The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input, which includes two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a string of length `n`. The constraints are that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`. The string consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' denotes an empty cell, '#' denotes a cell with an obstacle, 'G' denotes the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' denotes the insect's position. The function returns whether the grasshopper can reach the insect's position given the constraints and the string representation of the cells.

Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a string of length `n`. It returns whether the grasshopper can reach the insect's position given the constraints and the string representation of the cells.**
