Postcondition: ***`mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer, and `i = mestok + k`. If `l[i] == '#'`, `fl` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[i] != '#'`, `fl` remains unchanged (still `False`) and we do not break out of the loop or if statement.***
