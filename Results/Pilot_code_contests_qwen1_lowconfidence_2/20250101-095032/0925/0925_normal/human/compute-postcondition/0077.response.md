The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only thing that happens is that execution is terminated at this point. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mestok` is a valid index in the list `l`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `mestok + 2k`, `fl` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
