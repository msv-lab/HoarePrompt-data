Postcondition: **`fl` is not False, `mestot` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element, and if the current value of `l[i]` is 'T', then the conditions remain as they were before the execution of the if-else block. If the current value of `l[i]` is 'T', the conditions related to 'G' do not apply.**
