Postcondition: ***`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is 1, `mestot` is the index of 'G' in `l` or `None`, `i` is 1. If `l[i]` is 'G', `mestok` remains 1 and `mestot` remains the index of 'G' in `l` or `None`. Since there is no else part, `mestok` and `mestot` do not change under other conditions.***
