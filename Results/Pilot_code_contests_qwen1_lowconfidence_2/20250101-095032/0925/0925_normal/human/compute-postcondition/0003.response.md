The code assigns `None` to the variable `mestot`. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`l1` is [n, k], `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is an input string, `mestot` is None**
