The code `mestok = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mestok`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `mestot` is less than `mestok`, and now `mestok` is assigned the value of `i`. Therefore, the new relationship between `mestot` and `mestok` is that `mestot` is less than `mestok`.

The other variables (`fl`, `l`, and `l[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`fl` is not False, `mestot` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element, the current value of `l[i]` is 'G', `mestok` is equal to `i`**
