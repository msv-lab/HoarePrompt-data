Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `l1` is `['n', 'k']`
   - `l` is a non-empty string
   - `mestok` is set to the index of 'G' in `l` if 'G' is found in `l`; otherwise, it remains `None`
   - `mestot` is set to the index of 'T' in `l` if 'T' is found in `l`; otherwise, it retains its original value, which is the index of 'G' in `l` or `None`
   - The loop breaks if both `mestok` and `mestot` are not `None`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(l) - 1`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has incremented `i` by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be updated to the next index in the string `l` for the next iteration.
   - Since `mestok` and `mestot` are only modified when 'G' or 'T' is found, their values will remain unchanged unless the current character in `l` (at index `i`) is 'G' or 'T'.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - `l[i]` will now be the character at index `1` in the string `l`.
   - The values of `mestok` and `mestot` will remain the same unless the character at index `1` is 'G' or 'T'.

Given this analysis, the state for the next iteration should reflect the following:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `1`.
- `mestok` and `mestot` retain their original values from the previous iteration unless they are updated in the loop body.

Since no specific changes to `mestok` and `mestot` are mentioned in the loop body, we assume they stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is set to the index of 'G' in `l` if 'G' is found in `l`; otherwise, it remains `None`, `mestot` is set to the index of 'T' in `l` if 'T' is found in `l`; otherwise, it retains its original value which is the index of 'G' in `l` or `None`, `i` is 1**
