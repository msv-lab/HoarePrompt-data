Postcondition: ***`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is set to the index of 'G' in `l` if 'G' is found in `l`; otherwise, `mestok` remains `None`, and if `l[i] == 'T'`, then `mestot` is set to `i`. If `l[i] != 'T'`, `mestot` retains its original value which is either the index of 'G' in `l` or `None`.***
