Postcondition: ***`fl` is not `False`, `mestok` is decremented by at least 1, `mestot` will remain the same unless `l[i] == 'T'` during the next iteration, `l` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the current value of `i` + 1. If `l[i] == 'G'`, then `mestok` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mestok` remains unchanged.***
