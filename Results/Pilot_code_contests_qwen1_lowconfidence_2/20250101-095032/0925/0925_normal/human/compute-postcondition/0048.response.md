Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `fl` is not `False` (`fl != False`)
- `mestot` is less than `mestok` (`mestot < mestok`)
- `l` is the reversed version of its original state

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(len(l)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Condition for the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the condition `len(l)` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is not an empty list.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `l` is mentioned to be the reversed version of its original state, this implies that `l` was originally a non-empty list (otherwise, reversing an empty list would still result in an empty list).
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `l` should not be an empty list. Hence, `l` must have at least one element.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to include the condition that `l` is not an empty list. 

### Final Answer:
State: **`fl` is not False, `mestot` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element**
