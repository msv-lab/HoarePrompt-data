Postcondition: ***`fl` is not False, `mestot` is less than `mestok`, `l` must have at least one element. If the current value of `l[i]` is 'T', then `mestot` equals `i`. If the current value of `l[i]` is 'G', then `mestok` equals `i`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the execution of the if-else block.***
