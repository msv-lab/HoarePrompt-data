The code `l = raw_input()` reads a line from input and assigns it to the variable `l`. However, the initial state does not specify what `raw_input()` returns, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l`. The only information we know is that `l1` remains unchanged and `n` and `k` retain their original values.

Output State: **`l1` is [n, k], `n` is the first element of `l1`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, `l` is an input string**
