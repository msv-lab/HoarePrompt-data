Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is an integer (not `None`), the absolute difference between `mestok` and `mestot` is divisible by `k`, and there exists at least one valid index `i` in the range `[mestok, len(l))` where the loop condition holds. If `l[i] == '#'`, then `fl` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `fl` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement is exited.***
