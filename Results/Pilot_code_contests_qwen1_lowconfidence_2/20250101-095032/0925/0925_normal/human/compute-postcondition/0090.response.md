Functionality: **The function accepts two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a string representing \( n \) cells. It determines whether a grasshopper, starting at the 'G' position, can jump to the 'T' position using jumps of length \( k \), without landing on any obstacles ('#'). If the grasshopper can reach the 'T' position under these conditions, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles edge cases such as when 'G' or 'T' are not found in the string, and when the 'T' is not reachable due to obstacles or distance constraints.**
