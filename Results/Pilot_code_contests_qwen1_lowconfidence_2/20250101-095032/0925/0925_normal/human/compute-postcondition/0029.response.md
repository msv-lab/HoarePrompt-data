Output State: **`l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in `l` (or None if 'G' is not found), `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in `l` (or the index of the last 'G' if 'T' is not found or None if neither 'G' nor 'T' is found).**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `l`.
- It sets `mestok` to the index of the first 'G' it encounters and `mestot` to the index of the first 'T' it encounters.
- If both `mestok` and `mestot` are set (i.e., both 'G' and 'T' are found in `l`), the loop breaks immediately.
- If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., no 'G' or 'T' is found in `l`), both `mestok` and `mestot` remain `None`.
- After the loop finishes, `mestok` will hold the index of the last 'G' encountered (if any), and `mestot` will hold the index of the last 'T' encountered (if any). If 'G' is not found, `mestok` will be `None`. If 'T' is not found, `mestot` will be `None`. If neither 'G' nor 'T' is found, both will be `None`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing is as described above.
