Precondition: **The input consists of two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, representing the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump respectively. The second line is a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' denotes an empty cell, '#' denotes a cell with an obstacle, 'G' denotes the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' denotes the insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.**
