You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.

Output

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

5 2
#G#T#


Output

YES


Input

6 1
T....G


Output

YES


Input

7 3
T..#..G


Output

NO


Input

6 2
..GT..


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = raw_input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    fl = True
    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
        if fl != False and mestot < mestok:
            l = l[::-1]
            for i in range(len(l)):
                if l[i] == 'G':
                    mestok = i
                if l[i] == 'T':
                    mestot = i
            for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
                if l[i] == '#':
                    fl = False
                    break
        if fl == True:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the possibility of the grasshopper reaching the insect. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper and the insect are on opposite sides of the line with obstacles in between. 

Consider the following input:
```
8 3
#.G...T#
```

- The grasshopper starts at position 2 ('G').
- The insect is at position 9 ('T').
- The jump length `k` is 3.

The program would check if the distance between the grasshopper and the insect (`abs(2 - 9)`) is divisible by `k` (which it is, since `7 % 3 != 0`). However, the program then attempts to verify the path by iterating from the grasshopper's position towards the end of the line, which fails to consider the obstacle at position 3. Instead, it should check both directions (from the grasshopper to the insect and vice versa) and ensure there are no obstacles in the way.

To fix this, the program should check both directions and ensure the path is clear without assuming the direction based on the positions of 'G' and 'T'. Here’s a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    
    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        found = False
        # Check from G to T
        for i in range(mestok, mestot + 1, k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                break
        else:
            found = True
        
        # Check from T to G
        for i in range(mestot, mestok - 1, -k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                break
        else:
            found = True
        
        if found:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks both directions for a clear path, thus correctly determining if the grasshopper can reach the insect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, representing the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump respectively. The second line is a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' denotes an empty cell, '#' denotes a cell with an obstacle, 'G' denotes the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' denotes the insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

    l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))

    l = raw_input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l1` is ['n', 'k'], `l` is a non-empty string, `mestok` is the index of the last 'G' in `l` (or None if 'G' is not found), `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in `l` (or the index of the last 'G' if 'T' is not found or None if neither 'G' nor 'T' is found).
    fl = True
    if (abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0) :
        for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):

                if l[i] == 'G':

            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fl` is not `False`, `mestot` is the index of the last 'T' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestot` if there is no 'T', `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in the list `l` or the original value of `mestok` if there is no 'G', `l` is the reversed version of its original state, and `i` is the length of the list `l`.
            for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
                if l[i] == '#':
                    fl = False
                    break
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *fl is not False and mestot is less than mestok. If this condition is true, no specific changes are made to the output state. Since there is no else part, the output state remains unchanged.
        if (fl == True) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`fl` is not False, `mestot` is less than `mestok`. If `fl` is True, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output remains unchanged.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`fl` is True, `mestot` is less than `mestok`. If `abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the program checks if `abs(mestot - mestok) % k != 0` and does not change the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a string representing \( n \) cells. It determines whether a grasshopper, starting at the 'G' position, can jump to the 'T' position using jumps of length \( k \), without landing on any obstacles ('#'). If the grasshopper can reach the 'T' position under these conditions, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles edge cases such as when 'G' or 'T' are not found in the string, and when the 'T' is not reachable due to obstacles or distance constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
