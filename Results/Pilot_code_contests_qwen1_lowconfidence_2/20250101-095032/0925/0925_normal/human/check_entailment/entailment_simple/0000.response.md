Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input using `raw_input()`, which is not standard in Python 3. The correct method would be `input()` instead of `raw_input()`. However, this alone does not cause a functional issue.

2. **Finding Starting and Target Positions:**
   - The program correctly identifies the positions of 'G' and 'T'. However, it only breaks out of the loop once both positions are found, which is fine.

3. **Checking Jump Validity:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `mestok` and `mestot` is divisible by `k` to determine if a path exists. This is correct.
   - However, the program then performs unnecessary and incorrect operations if the condition is met.

4. **Reversing and Checking Again:**
   - The program reverses the string `l` and reassigns the positions of 'G' and 'T'. This step is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not address the problem correctly.
   - The logic to check if there is a path after reversing the string is flawed. It should directly check if the path exists without reversing the string.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - The final decision to print 'YES' or 'NO' is incorrect due to the above steps. The program should only check if the path exists based on the initial positions and the jump length `k`.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    # Read input
    l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, k = l1[0], l1[1]
    l = input()

    # Find positions of 'G' and 'T'
    for i in range(n):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        elif l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok is not None and mestot is not None:
            break

    # Check if the difference between positions is divisible by k
    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        # Check if there are no obstacles on the path
        for i in range(min(mestok, mestot), max(mestok, mestot) + 1, k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                print('NO')
                return
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:
- The program reads the input using `input()` as required.
- It finds the positions of 'G' and 'T'.
- It checks if the absolute difference between the positions is divisible by `k`.
- It then checks if there are no obstacles on the path by iterating through the required cells.
- Finally, it prints 'YES' if the path is clear and 'NO' otherwise.

This implementation ensures that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
