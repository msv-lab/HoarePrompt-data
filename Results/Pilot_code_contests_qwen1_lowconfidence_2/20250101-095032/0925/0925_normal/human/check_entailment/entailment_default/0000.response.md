Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain cases. Specifically, the code checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by \( k \), and then it attempts to check if there are any obstacles in the path. However, the code only checks the path in one direction (from 'G' to 'T') and does not reverse the string to check the other direction if the first check fails.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:

Consider the input:
```
6 2
T..#G.
```

In this case:
- 'G' is at position 5.
- 'T' is at position 1.
- The absolute difference between the positions is \( |5 - 1| = 4 \), which is divisible by \( k = 2 \).
- However, there is an obstacle at position 3, which prevents the grasshopper from reaching 'T'.

The code would incorrectly print 'YES' because it only checks the forward path from 'G' to 'T' and does not consider the backward path. To fix this, the code should either:
1. Check both directions explicitly.
2. Reverse the string and check the path from 'T' to 'G' if the first check fails.

Since the code does not handle this scenario correctly, the correctness of the program is **False**.
