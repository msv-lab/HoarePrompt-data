You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.

Output

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

5 2
#G#T#


Output

YES


Input

6 1
T....G


Output

YES


Input

7 3
T..#..G


Output

NO


Input

6 2
..GT..


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = raw_input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    fl = True
    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
        if fl != False and mestot < mestok:
            l = l[::-1]
            for i in range(len(l)):
                if l[i] == 'G':
                    mestok = i
                if l[i] == 'T':
                    mestot = i
            for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
                if l[i] == '#':
                    fl = False
                    break
        if fl == True:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Output hints: The function accepts two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a string representing \( n \) cells. It determines whether a grasshopper, starting at the 'G' position, can jump to the 'T' position using jumps of length \( k \), without landing on any obstacles ('#'). If the grasshopper can reach the 'T' position under these conditions, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles edge cases such as when 'G' or 'T' are not found in the string, and when the 'T' is not reachable due to obstacles or distance constraints.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
