Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the square of the minimum size such that a 2n-gon (a regular polygon with \(2 \cdot n\) vertices) can be embedded within the square. The solution should consider the geometric properties of the 2n-gon and determine the smallest square that can contain it.

2. **Given Program**: The current implementation computes the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` for each test case. This expression is not related to the problem of finding the side length of the smallest square that can contain a 2n-gon.

3. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - For a regular 2n-gon with side length 1, the minimum side length of the square that can contain it depends on the geometry of the 2n-gon.
   - Specifically, the maximum distance from the center of the 2n-gon to any vertex (the circumradius) and the height of the 2n-gon (which determines the height needed for the square) need to be considered.
   - The formula to compute the side length of the smallest containing square involves trigonometric functions and the properties of the 2n-gon.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the circumradius \( R \) of the 2n-gon and then determining the side length \( s \) of the square using the relationship between the circumradius and the geometry of the 2n-gon.
   - The side length \( s \) of the square can be derived from the formula involving the circumradius and the sine of certain angles.

Since the provided program does not implement any of these geometric calculations and instead uses a completely unrelated mathematical expression, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
