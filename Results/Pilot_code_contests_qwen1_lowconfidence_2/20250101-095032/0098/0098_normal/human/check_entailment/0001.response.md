Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` computes the square's side length using the formula \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\), which is derived from the geometry of regular polygons. However, this formula is not valid for all values of \(n\).

For \(n = 3\), the formula should yield the square's side length for a hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius 1. The correct value for \(n = 3\) (i.e., a hexagon) should be approximately \(1.931851653\), but the given formula produces a different result. 

To verify, let's calculate the correct value for \(n = 3\):

- For a hexagon (2n-gon where \(n = 3\)), the side length of the circumscribing square is given by \(s = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.1547\). However, the problem requires finding the side length of the smallest square that can contain the hexagon, which is actually the diameter of the circumcircle of the hexagon, i.e., \(2\).

Using the formula \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)}\):

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right) \approx 0.965925826, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = 0.5
\]

\[
\text{Side length} = \frac{0.965925826}{0.5} \approx 1.931851652
\]

This value is close to the expected result, but the program's implementation does not account for the specific geometric properties of the hexagon correctly.

For other values of \(n\), the formula might also produce incorrect results due to the simplifications made in the derivation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
