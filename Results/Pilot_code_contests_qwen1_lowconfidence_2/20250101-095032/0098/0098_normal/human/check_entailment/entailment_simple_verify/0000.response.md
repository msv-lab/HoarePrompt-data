Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` is using the formula \(\frac{\cos(\pi / (4n))}{\sin(\pi / (2n))}\), which does not correctly represent the minimum side length of the square that can contain the 2n-gon. As explained, the correct formula for the side length of the square is \(\frac{1}{\sin(\pi / (2n))}\). The annotated version supports this by showing that the function is being called with an odd integer \(n\) such that \(3 \leq n \leq 199\), and the function returns a value calculated using the incorrect formula. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for the given problem description.
