Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code uses an incorrect formula to calculate the side length of the square that can contain the 2n-gon. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` uses the formula \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\), which does not correctly represent the relationship between the circumradius of the 2n-gon and the side length of the containing square. The correct formula, as derived from the geometry of the 2n-gon, is \(\frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\). Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for the given problem description, confirming the original assessment.
