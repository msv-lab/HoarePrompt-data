Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square that can embed the 2n-gon. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect for the given problem description.

The correct approach involves understanding the geometry of the 2n-gon. For a 2n-gon inscribed in a circle of radius \(R\), the side length of the square that can fully contain it is related to the distance between opposite vertices of the 2n-gon.

Given that the 2n-gon has a circumradius \(R\) and each side length is 1, we can derive the circumradius \(R\) using the formula for the circumradius of a regular polygon:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2 \sin(\pi / (2n))} \]

The diagonal of the square that can contain the 2n-gon would be twice the circumradius, since the farthest points in the 2n-gon will be opposite vertices of the square:
\[ \text{Side length of the square} = 2R = \frac{1}{\sin(\pi / (2n))} \]

The provided code uses a different formula that does not correctly represent this relationship. Specifically, the formula used is:
\[ \text{Side length of the square} = \frac{\cos(\pi / (4n))}{\sin(\pi / (2n))} \]

This formula does not match the geometric derivation and hence is incorrect. Therefore, the program fails to produce the correct result for the given problem description.
