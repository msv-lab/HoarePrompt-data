Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when the input `n` is even, which is a requirement according to the problem description. The problem specifically states that `n` must be an odd integer. However, the code does not include any checks to ensure that `n` is odd. If an even number is provided, the function `func_1` will still be called, leading to incorrect results. 

For example, if `n` is 4 (an even number), the function will still compute the value, which would be incorrect since the problem specifies that `n` must be odd. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, resulting in an incorrect solution.
