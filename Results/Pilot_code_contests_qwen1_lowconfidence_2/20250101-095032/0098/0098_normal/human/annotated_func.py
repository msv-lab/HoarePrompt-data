#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)) where n is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, where `n` must be an odd integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 199. It calculates and returns the value of \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\). There are no edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code; however, it is important to ensure that the input `n` adheres to the specified constraints before performing the calculation. If `n` is outside the given range or is even, the function will not execute correctly due to the constraints in the problem statement.
