You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point (xi, yi).

They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|. Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula <image>.

The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that the distance between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.

Input

The first line of the input contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of watchmen.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109).

Some positions may coincide.

Output

Print the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel.

Note

In the first sample, the distance between watchman 1 and watchman 2 is equal to |1 - 7| + |1 - 5| = 10 for Doctor Manhattan and <image> for Daniel. For pairs (1, 1), (1, 5) and (7, 5), (1, 5) Doctor Manhattan and Daniel will calculate the same distances.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    rows = {}
    cols = {}
    posi = {}
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]
        if x in rows:
            rows[x] += 1
        else:
            rows[x] = 1
        if y in cols:
            cols[y] += 1
        else:
            cols[y] = 1
        if (x, y) in posi:
            posi[x, y] += 1
        else:
            posi[x, y] = 1
    ans = 0
    for t in rows.keys():
        ans = ans + (rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2
    for t in cols.keys():
        ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2
    for t in posi.keys():
        if posi[t] > 1:
            ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2
    print(ans)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. 

Here's the breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Rows Calculation**: The program counts how many times each x-coordinate appears. If an x-coordinate appears `k` times, then there are `k * (k - 1) / 2` pairs of points that share the same x-coordinate. This is because we can choose any two points from the `k` points.

2. **Columns Calculation**: Similarly, the program counts how many times each y-coordinate appears. If a y-coordinate appears `k` times, then there are `k * (k - 1) / 2` pairs of points that share the same y-coordinate.

3. **Overlap Correction**: Points that share both the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate are counted twice in the previous steps. To correct this, the program subtracts the overcounted pairs. Specifically, if a point `(x, y)` appears `k` times, it has been counted `k * (k - 1) / 2` times in the rows and `k * (k - 1) / 2` times in the columns. However, since these pairs are double-counted, they are subtracted once.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is the sum of all the valid pairs after correcting for overlaps.

Given the above, the program handles all potential cases correctly, and no specific counterexample was found where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of points where each point is represented as a tuple (xi, yi) and consists of integers. The length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and for each point, the coordinates xi and yi satisfy |xi|, |yi| ≤ 10^9.

            rows[x] += 1
        else:
            rows[x] = 1
        
        if y in cols:
            cols[y] += 1
        else:
            cols[y] = 1
        
        if (x, y) in posi:
            posi[x, y] += 1

            posi[x, y] = 1

    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of points where each point is a tuple (xi, yi) with integer coordinates. It calculates and returns the number of unique pairs of points that share either the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate, without double-counting pairs. Specifically, it first counts the occurrences of each x-coordinate and y-coordinate. Then, it calculates the number of unique pairs for each x-coordinate (using the combination formula \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) where n is the count of occurrences) and adds these to the total count. It then does the same for each y-coordinate. Finally, it subtracts the overcounted pairs (pairs that have both the same x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate) from the total count. The function prints and returns the resulting count. Potential edge cases include when the input list is empty, which would result in no pairs being counted. Additionally, the function assumes that the input list contains valid tuples with integer coordinates and that the coordinates are within the specified bounds.
