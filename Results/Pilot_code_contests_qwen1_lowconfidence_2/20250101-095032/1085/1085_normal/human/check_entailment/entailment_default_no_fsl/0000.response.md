Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly count the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The code only counts pairs that share the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate, but it fails to account for pairs where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance, which requires both x and y coordinates to be the same.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0 0
1 1
2 2
3 3
```

The correct output should be 6 because there are 6 pairs where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance: (0,0) and (1,1), (0,0) and (2,2), (0,0) and (3,3), (1,1) and (2,2), (1,1) and (3,3), and (2,2) and (3,3). However, the provided code will output 3 because it only counts pairs with the same x or y coordinates.

The code needs to explicitly check for pairs where both x and y coordinates are the same and adjust the count accordingly.
