Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. 

Here's the breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Rows Calculation**: The program counts how many times each x-coordinate appears. If an x-coordinate appears `k` times, then there are `k * (k - 1) / 2` pairs of points that share the same x-coordinate. This is because we can choose any two points from the `k` points.

2. **Columns Calculation**: Similarly, the program counts how many times each y-coordinate appears. If a y-coordinate appears `k` times, then there are `k * (k - 1) / 2` pairs of points that share the same y-coordinate.

3. **Overlap Correction**: Points that share both the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate are counted twice in the previous steps. To correct this, the program subtracts the overcounted pairs. Specifically, if a point `(x, y)` appears `k` times, it has been counted `k * (k - 1) / 2` times in the rows and `k * (k - 1) / 2` times in the columns. However, since these pairs are double-counted, they are subtracted once.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is the sum of all the valid pairs after correcting for overlaps.

Given the above, the program handles all potential cases correctly, and no specific counterexample was found where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
