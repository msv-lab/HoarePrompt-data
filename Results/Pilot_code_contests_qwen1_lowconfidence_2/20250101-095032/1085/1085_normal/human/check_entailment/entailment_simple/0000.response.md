Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them, as calculated by Doctor Manhattan (Manhattan distance: \(|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|\)), is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel (Euclidean distance: \(\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}\)).
   - However, the program does not perform any calculation to check whether the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance for any pair of watchmen. Instead, it simply counts the number of pairs of watchmen with the same (x, y) coordinates.

2. **Counting Pairs with Same Coordinates:**
   - The program uses dictionaries to count the occurrences of each x-coordinate (`rows`) and each y-coordinate (`cols`). It also keeps track of the occurrences of each (x, y) coordinate pair (`posi`).
   - After counting these occurrences, the program calculates the number of pairs with the same x-coordinates and the same y-coordinates separately.
   - Finally, it subtracts the overcounted pairs from the total count by checking the pairs with the same (x, y) coordinates and adjusting the count accordingly.

3. **Why This Approach Is Incorrect:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that any pair of watchmen with the same (x, y) coordinates will have the same distance according to both methods. This assumption is false because the Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance can be different even if the coordinates are the same.
   - For example, consider two watchmen at coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 1). The Manhattan distance is 0, and the Euclidean distance is also 0. However, this is a special case. In general, watchmen at the same coordinates will not necessarily have the same Manhattan and Euclidean distances unless they are exactly the same point.

4. **Correct Solution:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to iterate through all pairs of watchmen and check whether the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance for each pair.
   - This involves computing both distances for each pair and comparing them.

Given these observations, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
