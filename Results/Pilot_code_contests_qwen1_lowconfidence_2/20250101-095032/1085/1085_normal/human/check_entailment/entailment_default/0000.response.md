Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem requires calculating the number of pairs of watchmen such that the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance. However, the code only counts pairs that share the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate, without considering the Euclidean distance. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
0 0
1 1
0 1
1 0
```

- The pairs (0,0) and (1,1) have the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate, so the Manhattan distance is 2 and the Euclidean distance is approximately 1.414, which are not equal.
- The pairs (0,0) and (0,1) have the same x-coordinate, so the Manhattan distance is 1 and the Euclidean distance is 1, which are equal.
- The pairs (0,0) and (1,0) have the same x-coordinate, so the Manhattan distance is 1 and the Euclidean distance is 1, which are equal.
- The pairs (1,1) and (0,1) have the same y-coordinate, so the Manhattan distance is 2 and the Euclidean distance is approximately 1.414, which are not equal.
- The pairs (1,1) and (1,0) have the same y-coordinate, so the Manhattan distance is 1 and the Euclidean distance is 1, which are equal.
- The pairs (0,1) and (1,0) have the same y-coordinate, so the Manhattan distance is 2 and the Euclidean distance is approximately 1.414, which are not equal.

The code will count the pairs (0,0) and (0,1), (0,0) and (1,0), and (1,1) and (1,0), but it will miss the pair (0,0) and (1,0) because they do not share the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the problem description.
