The function accepts a list of points where each point is a tuple (xi, yi) with integer coordinates. It calculates and returns the number of unique pairs of points that share either the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate, without double-counting pairs. Specifically, it first counts the occurrences of each x-coordinate and y-coordinate. Then, it calculates the number of unique pairs for each x-coordinate (using the combination formula \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) where n is the count of occurrences) and adds these to the total count. It then does the same for each y-coordinate. Finally, it subtracts the overcounted pairs (pairs that have both the same x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate) from the total count. The function prints and returns the resulting count. Potential edge cases include when the input list is empty, which would result in no pairs being counted. Additionally, the function assumes that the input list contains valid tuples with integer coordinates and that the coordinates are within the specified bounds.
