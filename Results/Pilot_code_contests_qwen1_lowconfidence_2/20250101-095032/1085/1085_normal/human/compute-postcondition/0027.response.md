`cols[y]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `y` is already a key in `cols`, the value associated with `y` in `cols` changes from either `2` or `1` to `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is `1`; `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `1`; `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
