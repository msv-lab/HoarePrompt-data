The code `rows[x] += 1` increments the value of `rows[x]` by 1. Since `x` is an integer from the input, the value of `rows[x]` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `y`, `cols`, `posi`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 3 or 2 or 1, otherwise `cols[y]` is set to 1; `rows[x]` is increased by 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `2` if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, otherwise `1`; `x` and `y` are integers from the input.**
