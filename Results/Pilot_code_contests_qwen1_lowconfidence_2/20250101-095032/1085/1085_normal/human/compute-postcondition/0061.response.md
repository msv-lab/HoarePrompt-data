`ans` is initially 0. The code updates `ans` by subtracting `(posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2`. Given that `posi[t]` is greater than 1, let's denote `posi[t]` as `k` where `k > 1`. Thus, the expression `(posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2` becomes `(k - 1) * k / 2`.

Since `k` is greater than 1, `(k - 1) * k / 2` is a positive integer. Let's denote this value as `val`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans - val`.

Given the initial value of `ans` is 0, after executing the line of code, `ans` becomes `-val`.

Output State: **`ans` is -((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2), `i` is 0, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `rows` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is a non-empty dictionary, and the value of `posi[t]` is greater than 1**
