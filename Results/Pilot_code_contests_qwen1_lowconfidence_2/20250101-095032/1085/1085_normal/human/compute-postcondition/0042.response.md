Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0; `y` is a key in `cols`; `cols[y]` can be either 4, 3, 2, or 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` now set to `3` if it was `2` before, `2` if it was `1` before, or `1` if `(x, y)` was not in `posi` at all; `x` and `y` are integers from the input.***
