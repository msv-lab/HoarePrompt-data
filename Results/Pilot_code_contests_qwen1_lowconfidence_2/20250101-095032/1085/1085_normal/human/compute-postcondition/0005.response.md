The code splits the input into two integers `x` and `y` and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial values of `n`, `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` are unchanged, but now `x` and `y` have specific integer values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is an empty dictionary, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is an empty dictionary, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input**
