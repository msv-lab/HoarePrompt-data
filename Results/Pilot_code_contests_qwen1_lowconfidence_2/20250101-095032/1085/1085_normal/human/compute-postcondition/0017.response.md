The code `posi[x, y] += 1` increments the value of `posi[x, y]` by 1. Given the initial state, `posi` is an empty dictionary, meaning `posi[x, y]` does not exist before the operation. After the operation, `posi[x, y]` will be assigned the value 1.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 0, if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 2 or 1. Otherwise, `cols[y]` is set to 1. `rows` is a dictionary containing either one entry `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}`, depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`. `posi` now contains the entry `{(x, y): 1}`.
