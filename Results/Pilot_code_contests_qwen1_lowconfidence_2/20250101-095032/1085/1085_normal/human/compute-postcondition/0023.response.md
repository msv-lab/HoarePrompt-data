The code `rows[x] += 1` increments the value of `rows[x]` by 1. Given the initial state, `rows` is a dictionary containing either one entry `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}`, depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`. Since `x` is an integer from the input, the value of `rows[x]` will be incremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `y`, `cols`, `posi`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 2 or 1, otherwise `cols[y]` is set to 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing `{x: rows[x] + 1}`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `1`; `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
