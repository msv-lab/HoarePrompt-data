The code updates `ans` by adding \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) to its current value. Since `rows` must have at least two keys remaining, the key `t` exists in `rows`. The value of `ans` is updated, but the exact new value depends on the value of `rows[t]`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\), `rows` must have at least two keys remaining**
