Output State: **`ans` is the sum of \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for all keys `t` in `cols`, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `rows` is a dictionary where each key `x` is associated with a value that is the count of occurrences of `x` across all iterations of the loop, `posi` is a dictionary where each key `(x, y)` is associated with a value that is the count of occurrences of the pair `(x, y)` across all iterations of the loop, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ans` is the sum of \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) for all keys `t` in `rows`.
- The loop iterates over the keys in `cols` and updates `ans` by adding \((cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2\) for each key `t`.
- After each iteration of the loop, the corresponding key `t` in `cols` is removed, making `cols` an empty dictionary once the loop completes.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so after all iterations, `i` will be equal to the number of times the loop has executed.
- The dictionaries `rows` and `posi` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
