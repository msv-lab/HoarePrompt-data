Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `cols` is a dictionary where each key `y` is associated with a value that is the count of occurrences of `y` across all iterations of the loop; `rows` is a dictionary where each key `x` is associated with a value that is the count of occurrences of `x` across all iterations of the loop; `posi` is a dictionary where each key `(x, y)` is associated with a value that is the count of occurrences of the pair `(x, y)` across all iterations of the loop; `x` and `y` are integers from the input; `i` is equal to `n`.**
