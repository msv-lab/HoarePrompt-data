The code `rows = {}` creates an empty dictionary named `rows`. This does not affect the value of `n` or any other variables. The initial state is that `n` is the integer value entered by the user, representing the number of points in the list, and now `rows` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, representing the number of points in the list, and `rows` is an empty dictionary.**
