The code `rows[x] = 1` updates the value of `rows[x]` to 1. Since `x` is an integer from the input, this assignment changes the value of `rows[x]` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 2 or 1, otherwise `cols[y]` is set to 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing `{x: 1}` (since `rows[x]` is now 1); `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `1`; `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
