Postcondition: ***`ans` is \(-((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2)\), `i` is 0, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `rows` is an empty dictionary, and `posi` is a non-empty dictionary. Since the if condition `posi[t] > 1` is not met (as indicated by the if part's postcondition), the overall postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.***
