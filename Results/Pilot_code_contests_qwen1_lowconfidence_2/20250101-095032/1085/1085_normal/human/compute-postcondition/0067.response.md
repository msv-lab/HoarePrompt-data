The initial value of `ans` is \(-((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2)\). The code subtracts \((posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2\) from `ans`. Since `posi[t]` is the same in both `ans`'s value and the subtraction, we can simplify this operation.

Let's denote `posi[t]` as `p`. Then `ans` initially is \(-((p - 1) * p / 2)\). After the operation, `ans` becomes \(-((p - 1) * p / 2) - (p - 1) * p / 2\).

Simplifying the new value of `ans`:
\[
-((p - 1) * p / 2) - (p - 1) * p / 2 = -(2 \cdot ((p - 1) * p / 2)) = -(p - 1) * p
\]

Therefore, `ans` is now \(-(p - 1) * p\).

The other variables (`i`, `cols`, `rows`) are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`ans` is \(-(posi[t] - 1) * posi[t]\), `i` is 1, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `rows` is an empty dictionary**.
