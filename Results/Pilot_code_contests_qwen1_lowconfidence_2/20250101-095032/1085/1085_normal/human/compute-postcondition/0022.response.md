The code `x, y = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This changes the values of `x` and `y` from their initial values to the integers entered in the input. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 2 or 1, otherwise `cols[y]` is set to 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing either one entry `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}`, depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `1`; `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
