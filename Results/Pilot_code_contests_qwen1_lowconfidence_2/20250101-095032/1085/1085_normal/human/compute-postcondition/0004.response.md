According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the states given are:

- `n` is the integer value entered by the user (this does not guarantee the loop will execute).
- `rows` is an empty dictionary.
- `cols` is an empty dictionary.
- `posi` is an empty dictionary.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is an empty dictionary, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is an empty dictionary**
