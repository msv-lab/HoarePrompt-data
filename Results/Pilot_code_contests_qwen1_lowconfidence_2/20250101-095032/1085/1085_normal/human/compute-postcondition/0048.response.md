`ans` is updated to its current value plus \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\), where `rows[t]` is the value of `rows` at the last key `t`, and `rows` must have at least one key remaining. The code directly updates the value of `ans` using the formula provided. Since the exact value of `rows[t]` is not specified, we keep it in the expression. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\), `rows` must have at least one key remaining**
