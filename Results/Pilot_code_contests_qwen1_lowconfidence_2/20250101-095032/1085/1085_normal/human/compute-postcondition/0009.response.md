`rows[x]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `x` is an integer from the input, and the value of `y` is an integer from the input but it is not used in this particular line of code. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary with one entry `{x: 1}`, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is an empty dictionary, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input.
