The code snippet `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans`. However, since no operations are performed on `ans` before printing it, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `cols`, `rows`, and `posi`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of \(-(posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2)\ for all keys `t` in `posi` where `posi[t] > 1`, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `rows` is an empty dictionary, and `posi` is a dictionary containing pairs `(x, y)` with counts of occurrences of such pairs. The value of `ans` is printed.**
