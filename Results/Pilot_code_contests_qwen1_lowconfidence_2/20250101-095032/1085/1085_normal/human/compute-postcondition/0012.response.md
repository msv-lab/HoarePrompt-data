`cols[y]` is incremented by 1. Since `cols` is a dictionary with `y` as a key, the previous value of `cols[y]` could either be 1 (if `x` was already present) or 0 (if `x` was not present). After the increment, `cols[y]` will be either 2 or 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary containing either one entry `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}`, depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`, `cols` is a dictionary with `y` as a key and `cols[y]` is either 2 or 1, `posi` is an empty dictionary, `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input.**
