The code snippet reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input and splits them by a space. This means that `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the split inputs, but the values themselves are not specified in the initial state. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `x, y = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`.

Since the values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, they are simply assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 3 or 2 or 1, otherwise `cols[y]` is set to 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `2` if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, otherwise `1`; `x` and `y` are integers from the input.**
