According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and the dictionary `rows`. The loop iterates over the keys of the `rows` dictionary. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated to its current value plus \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\) and `rows` must have at least one key remaining.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ans` is updated based on the current value of `t`.
- `rows` must still have at least one key remaining for the loop to continue.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `t` should be the next key in `rows`.
- `rows` must still have at least one key remaining (since we are iterating through the keys).

Let's assume that the current `t` was the last key in the `rows` dictionary. For the loop to execute again, there must be another key in `rows`.

State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\), `rows` must have at least two keys remaining**
