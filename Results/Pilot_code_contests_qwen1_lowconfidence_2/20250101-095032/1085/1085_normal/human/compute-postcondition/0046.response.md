The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2` to its current value. However, the initial values of `ans` and `rows[t]` are not specified in the initial state. Since we cannot determine the exact values without more information, we can only express the updated value of `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value plus \((rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2\), where `rows[t]` is the value of `rows` at index `t`.**
