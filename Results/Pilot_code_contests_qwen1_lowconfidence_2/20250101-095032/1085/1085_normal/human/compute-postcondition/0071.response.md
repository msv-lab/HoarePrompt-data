The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of points. Each point in the list is represented as a tuple (xi, yi) and consists of integers. The length of the list is `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and for each point, the coordinates `xi` and `yi` satisfy |xi|, |yi| ≤ 10^9.

The function does not explicitly return anything based on the provided output cases, but rather describes conditions under which different outputs might occur if there were specific return statements. However, based on the problem statement alone, the function simply processes the list of points without specifying any particular return value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of points where each point is a tuple (xi, yi) with integer coordinates, and no explicit return value is mentioned.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of points where each point is a tuple (xi, yi) with integer coordinates.**
