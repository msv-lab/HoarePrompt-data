Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 3 or 2 or 1, otherwise `cols[y]` is set to 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `1`; `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.***
