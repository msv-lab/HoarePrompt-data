The code `cols = {}` creates a new empty dictionary named `cols`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the fact that `rows` is an empty dictionary. Therefore, the only change is that `cols` is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `rows` is an empty dictionary, `cols` is an empty dictionary**
