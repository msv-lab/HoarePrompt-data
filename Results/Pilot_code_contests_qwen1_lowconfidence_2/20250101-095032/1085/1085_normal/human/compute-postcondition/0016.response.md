Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 2 or 1. Otherwise, `cols[y]` is set to 1. `rows` is a dictionary containing either one entry `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}`, depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`. `posi` remains an empty dictionary. The current state indicates that `(x, y)` is already a key in `posi`.***
