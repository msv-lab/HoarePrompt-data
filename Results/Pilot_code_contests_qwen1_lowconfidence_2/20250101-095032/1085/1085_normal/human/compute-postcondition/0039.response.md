Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0; `y` is a key in `cols`. If `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` can be either 4, 3, 2, or 1. `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`. `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `2` if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, otherwise `1`. `x` and `y` are integers from the input.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that all possible outcomes are covered while maintaining the initial conditions and the relationships between the variables as described in the preconditions.
