Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary containing either one entry `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}`, depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`, `cols` is a dictionary with `y` as a key (since `y` is in `cols`), `posi` is an empty dictionary, `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input.**
