Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 3 or 2 or 1.
   - Otherwise, `cols[y]` is set to 1.
   - `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`.
   - `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `2` if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, otherwise `1`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers from the input.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`i = i + 1`), the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, the new value of `i` must still be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, as it is the only variable directly involved in the loop condition.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - If `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 3 or 2 or 1 (unchanged).
   - Otherwise, `cols[y]` is set to 1 (unchanged).
   - `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows` (unchanged).
   - `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `2` if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, otherwise `1` (unchanged).
   - `x` and `y` are integers from the input (unchanged).
   - `i` is now `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0; if `y` is already a key in `cols`, then `cols[y]` is either 3 or 2 or 1, otherwise `cols[y]` is set to 1; `rows` is a dictionary containing either `{x: rows[x] + 1}` or `{x: 1}` depending on whether `x` was already present in `rows`; `posi` is a dictionary with the key `(x, y)` having the value `2` if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, otherwise `1`; `x` and `y` are integers from the input; `i` is `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.**
