The function `func_4()` accepts a space-separated list of integers as input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a conversion of one of the input integers. The input list must satisfy the condition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300,000, with a_i ≥ a_{i+1}. The function reads the input as a single line of space-separated integers, converts them to strings, and returns the resulting list. Note that the function does not modify the original list of integers; instead, it creates a new list of strings from the input integers.
