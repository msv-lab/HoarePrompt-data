The function `func_5()` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. This list represents the number of non-overlapping dominos that can be drawn for a Young diagram, where the column lengths are specified in the output of `func_3()`. The function essentially takes the list of column lengths returned by `func_3()` and calculates the number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed in a Young diagram with those column lengths.
