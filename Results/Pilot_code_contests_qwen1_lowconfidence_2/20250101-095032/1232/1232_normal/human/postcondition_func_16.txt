The function `func_17()` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of columns in the histogram, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` represents the length of the corresponding column and satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 300,000 and `a_i` ≥ `a_{i+1}`. After executing a for loop that iterates through the list `a`, the function calculates two sums: `w` which is the sum of `a[i] // 2` for all even indices `i` and `(a[i] + 1) // 2` for all odd indices `i`, and `b` which is the sum of `(a[i] + 1) // 2` for all even indices `i` and `a[i] // 2` for all odd indices `i`. Finally, the function calls another function `func_18()` with the minimum of `w` and `b` as its argument.
