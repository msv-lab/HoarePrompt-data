The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 300,000 (inclusive) and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. The function correctly converts the integer to binary using Python's built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix by replacing it with an empty string. This ensures that the returned value is a valid binary string representation of the input integer. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of `n` within the specified range, as well as the case where `n` is exactly 1 or 300,000.
