The function `func_15` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` or `False` based on specific divisibility conditions. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it returns `True`. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`. For other values of `n`, it checks for divisibility by numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If no such divisor is found, it returns `True`.
