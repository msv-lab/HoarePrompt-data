The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond creating and returning the 2D list as described.
