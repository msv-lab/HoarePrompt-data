The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of non-negative integers representing the lengths of columns in a Young diagram, with the constraint that the lengths are between 1 and 300,000 and form a non-increasing sequence. The function returns a new list that is sorted according to a custom sorting key defined by the `getKey` function. After the function execution, the returned list maintains the property that the length of each column (element) is between 1 and 300,000, and the elements are non-increasing. Potential edge cases include lists that are already sorted or contain only one element, where the sorting operation does not change the list. The function does not modify the original list but instead returns a new sorted list.
