You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a Young diagram. 

Given diagram is a histogram with n columns of lengths a_1, a_2, …, a_n (a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ … ≥ a_n ≥ 1).

<image> Young diagram for a=[3,2,2,2,1].

Your goal is to find the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of this histogram, a domino is a 1 × 2 or 2 × 1 rectangle.

Input

The first line of input contain one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000): the number of columns in the given histogram.

The next line of input contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300 000, a_i ≥ a_{i+1}): the lengths of columns.

Output

Output one integer: the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of the given Young diagram.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem of finding the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that can be drawn inside a given Young diagram. Instead, it appears to be a collection of utility functions without any main logic to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to iterate through the histogram and calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos. A key observation is that each domino covers two adjacent cells in the histogram. Therefore, we can iterate through the histogram and count the number of even and odd values, which will help us determine the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_non_overlapping_dominos(a):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for height in a:
        if height % 2 == 0:
            even_count += height // 2
        else:
            odd_count += height // 2
            even_count += 1
    
    return min(even_count, odd_count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(max_non_overlapping_dominos(a))
```

This program correctly counts the number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed in the histogram by iterating through the input and using the counts of even and odd heights to determine the maximum number of dominos.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
