Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_17()` does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed in a Young diagram. Specifically, the logic for calculating `w` and `b` is flawed. The logic attempts to distribute the columns into two groups based on their indices but does not account for the optimal way to pair columns to maximize the number of dominos. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5
3 2 2 2 1
```

The correct approach would be to pair the columns optimally, which in this case would be to pair the 3 with one of the 2s, and the remaining 2s with the 1. This would result in 4 dominos (3+2, 2+2, 2+1, and 1+0). However, the current implementation does not correctly account for this and results in a lower number of dominos being counted.

To fix this, the code needs to implement an optimal pairing strategy, such as a dynamic programming approach to maximize the number of dominos.
