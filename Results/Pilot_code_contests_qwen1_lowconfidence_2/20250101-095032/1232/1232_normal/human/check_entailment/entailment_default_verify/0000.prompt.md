You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a Young diagram. 

Given diagram is a histogram with n columns of lengths a_1, a_2, …, a_n (a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ … ≥ a_n ≥ 1).

<image> Young diagram for a=[3,2,2,2,1].

Your goal is to find the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of this histogram, a domino is a 1 × 2 or 2 × 1 rectangle.

Input

The first line of input contain one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000): the number of columns in the given histogram.

The next line of input contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300 000, a_i ≥ a_{i+1}): the lengths of columns.

Output

Output one integer: the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of the given Young diagram.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem of finding the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that can be drawn inside a given Young diagram. Instead, it appears to be a collection of utility functions without any main logic to solve the problem.

To solve the problem, we need to iterate through the histogram and calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos. A key observation is that each domino covers two adjacent cells in the histogram. Therefore, we can iterate through the histogram and count the number of even and odd values, which will help us determine the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_non_overlapping_dominos(a):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for height in a:
        if height % 2 == 0:
            even_count += height // 2
        else:
            odd_count += height // 2
            even_count += 1
    
    return min(even_count, odd_count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(max_non_overlapping_dominos(a))
```

This program correctly counts the number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed in the histogram by iterating through the input and using the counts of even and odd heights to determine the maximum number of dominos.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 18 : The function `func_18()` takes a single positional argument `args`, which is a list containing the lengths of the columns of a Young diagram. It also accepts keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. The function writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to the specified output stream (`sys.stdout` by default) with a specified separator (`' '` by default) between them. After writing, it appends the value of `end` (default is `\n`) to the output. If `flush` is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream’s buffer. The function does not return anything. Potential edge cases include empty lists in `args` and non-string values. The function assumes that `args` contains at least one element.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
