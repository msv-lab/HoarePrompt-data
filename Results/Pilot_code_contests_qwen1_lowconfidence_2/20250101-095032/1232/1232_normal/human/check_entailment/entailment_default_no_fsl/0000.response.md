Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_17` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of non-overlapping dominos is flawed. Let's break down why:

1. **Logic in `func_17`:**
   ```python
   n = func_1()
   a = func_5()
   w = 0
   b = 0
   for i in range(n):
       if i % 2:
           b += (a[i] + 1) // 2
           w += a[i] // 2
       else:
           w += (a[i] + 1) // 2
           b += a[i] // 2
   func_18(min(w, b))
   ```

2. **Issue with Logic:**
   - The logic in the for loop seems to be attempting to calculate the number of dominos by splitting the heights of the columns into two different sums (`w` and `b`). However, this approach is incorrect.
   - The correct approach involves a more nuanced calculation. We should aim to pair up columns to form dominos optimally.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the number of non-overlapping dominos, we should pair up columns in such a way that we utilize the shorter column in each pair to minimize the unused space.
   - A correct approach would involve iterating through the list and pairing up columns in a way that maximizes the number of full dominos formed.

Here is an example to illustrate why the current logic is incorrect:

### Example Input:
```plaintext
5
3 2 2 2 1
```

### Expected Output:
```plaintext
4
```

### Current Logic Output:
```plaintext
2
```

### Explanation:
- The current logic splits the columns into two sums `w` and `b` in a manner that does not account for the optimal pairing of columns to form dominos.
- The correct solution would be to iterate through the list and form pairs in such a way that we maximize the number of full dominos. In this case, the optimal pairs would be (3, 2), (2, 2), and (2, 1), yielding 4 dominos.

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
