The function reads the lengths of columns in a histogram from a file named 'input.txt', processes these lengths to determine the height of the tallest column, and writes the result to a file named 'output.txt'. The function assumes the input lengths are sorted in non-increasing order and each length is between 1 and 300,000 inclusive. If the input file is empty or does not exist, the function will still attempt to read it and handle it accordingly, potentially leading to an output value of 0. If the input file does not contain any valid column lengths, the function will also return 0.
