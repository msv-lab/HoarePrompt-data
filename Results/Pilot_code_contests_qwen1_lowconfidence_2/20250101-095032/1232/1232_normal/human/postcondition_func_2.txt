The function reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` integers from the user input, ensuring that each integer is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300,000 and that the sequence of integers is non-increasing (a_i ≥ a_{i+1}). It returns a map object containing these integers. However, the function does not enforce the non-increasing condition on the input integers; it only reads them as specified. Therefore, the returned map object might contain integers that do not satisfy a_i ≥ a_{i+1}. Additionally, the function does not provide any error handling for invalid inputs, such as when `n` is outside the specified range or when the input integers are out of bounds.
