Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`; `sys.stdout` has had the string representation of the next element in `args` and a space written to it. Since the `at_start` condition is `False` in the if part, this is the only case that applies, and `sys.stdout` has had the string representation of the next element in `args` and a space written to it.***
