The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`args`, `kwargs`, `x`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty list with two fewer elements, `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, `x` is printed to the standard output.
