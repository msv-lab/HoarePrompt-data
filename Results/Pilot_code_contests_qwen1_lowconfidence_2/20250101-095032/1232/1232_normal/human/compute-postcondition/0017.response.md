`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout` in this case. This means `x` is printed to the standard output. The value of `args` and `kwargs` remains unchanged, except that `x` is printed. The initial state of `at_start` being `False` does not change.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list with two fewer elements, `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, `x` is printed to the standard output.**
