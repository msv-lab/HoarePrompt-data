Functionality: **The function `func_18()` takes a single positional argument `args`, which is a list containing the lengths of the columns of a Young diagram. It also accepts keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. The function writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to the specified output stream (`sys.stdout` by default) with a specified separator (`' '` by default) between them. After writing, it appends the value of `end` (default is `\n`) to the output. If `flush` is set to `True`, it flushes the output streamâ€™s buffer. The function does not return anything. Potential edge cases include empty lists in `args` and non-string values. The function assumes that `args` contains at least one element.**

**Final state of the program after the function concludes:**
- `args` is an empty list.
- `kwargs` contains `sep=' '`, `file=sys.stdout`, and `at_start=False`.
- `sys.stdout` contains the string representations of all elements in the original `args` list concatenated together with the separator `' '` in between each element, followed by the value of `end`.
- If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, `sys.stdout`'s internal buffer is flushed; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
