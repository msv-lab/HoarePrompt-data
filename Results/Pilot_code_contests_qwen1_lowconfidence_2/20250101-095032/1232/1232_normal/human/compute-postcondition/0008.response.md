The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`args`, `n`, `kwargs`, `sys.stdout`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 300,000\) and \(a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots \geq a_n \geq 1\), `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has had the string representation of `x` written to it.**
