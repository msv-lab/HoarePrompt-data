The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `' '` according to the initial state) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout` according to the initial state). This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list with two fewer elements, `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`**
