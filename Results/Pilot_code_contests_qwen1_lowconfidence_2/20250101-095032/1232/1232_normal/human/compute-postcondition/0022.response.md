The code `file.flush()` is executed, which flushes the internal buffer of `file` (which is `sys.stdout` in this case). However, the `flush` operation itself does not change the values of the variables `args`, `kwargs`, or `at_start`. Therefore, the only change is in the internal state of `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` is an empty list, `kwargs` now has `sep=' '`, `file=sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`; `sys.stdout`'s internal buffer is flushed.**
