The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `args`, which is a variable-length argument list. The first element of this list is a list representing the lengths of the columns of the Young diagram (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000 and a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ ... ≥ a_n ≥ 1.

Given the provided constraints and relationships, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. Therefore, we can infer that the function's return value is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `args`, where the first element is a list representing the lengths of the columns of the Young diagram, and returns nothing.**
