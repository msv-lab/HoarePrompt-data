The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list where the first element is a list representing the lengths of the columns of the Young diagram (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 300,000\) and \(a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots \geq a_n \geq 1\); `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '` if not provided and `file` set to `sys.stdout` if not provided; `at_start` is `True`.**
