The function `func_17` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of columns in the histogram, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers. Each integer `a_i` in the list represents the length of the corresponding column and satisfies the conditions 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 300,000 and `a_i` ≥ `a_{i+1}`. The function does not return any specific value directly mentioned in the provided information.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, it seems the function might be calculating something related to the histogram, but without further details on the expected output, we can only state the parameters.
