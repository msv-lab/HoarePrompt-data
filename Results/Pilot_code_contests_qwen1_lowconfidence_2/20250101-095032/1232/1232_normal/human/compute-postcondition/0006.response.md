Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty list, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 300,000\) and \(a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots \geq a_n \geq 1\), `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`. If `at_start` is `False` before the execution, `sys.stdout` has had a space written to it.***
