`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The value of `at_start` was already `False`, so it does not change. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.
