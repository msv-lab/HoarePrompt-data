Functionality: **The function `func_17()` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of columns in the histogram, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` represents the length of the corresponding column and satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 300,000 and `a_i` ≥ `a_{i+1}`. After executing a for loop that iterates through the list `a`, the function calculates two sums: `w` which is the sum of `a[i] // 2` for all even indices `i` and `(a[i] + 1) // 2` for all odd indices `i`, and `b` which is the sum of `(a[i] + 1) // 2` for all even indices `i` and `a[i] // 2` for all odd indices `i`. Finally, the function calls another function `func_18()` with the minimum of `w` and `b` as its argument.**

This summary covers the following points:
- The function accepts `n` and `a` as parameters.
- It iterates through the list `a` and calculates `w` and `b` based on the given conditions.
- It ensures that the calculations are performed correctly for both even and odd indices.
- It handles the edge case where the list `a` might have only one element (though this specific case is not explicitly covered in the annotations).
- It calls `func_18()` with the minimum value between `w` and `b`.
