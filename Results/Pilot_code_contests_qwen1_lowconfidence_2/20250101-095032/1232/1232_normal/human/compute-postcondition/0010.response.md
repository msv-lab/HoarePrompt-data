`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `' '` according to the initial state) to `sys.stdout`. The `args` list remains unchanged, `kwargs` remains with `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` remains `False`. After writing, the `sys.stdout` will have the space character added to its current content.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `kwargs` now has `sep` set to `' '`, `file` set to `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`; `sys.stdout` has had the string representation of the next element in `args` and a space written to it.**
