The function prompts the user to input an integer and returns this integer. There are no additional actions performed within the function. The function expects the user to provide an integer input, and if the user inputs a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined as the `input()` function will still return a string. If the user provides a string that cannot be converted to an integer, a `ValueError` will be raised, which is not handled within this function. The function does not validate the range of the integer input.
