The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing at least two elements, where the second element is an integer representing the length of a column in the Young diagram. The function returns this integer value. The function does not modify the input `item` and only extracts and returns the second element of the tuple or list. If `item` does not meet the requirement of being a tuple or list with at least two elements, the function's behavior is undefined. If the second element is not an integer, the function's behavior is also undefined.
