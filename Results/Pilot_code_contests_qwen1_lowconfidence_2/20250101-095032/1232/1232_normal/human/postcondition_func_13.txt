The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes zero, at which point it returns `x` as the GCD. This GCD is guaranteed to be the largest integer that divides both `x` and `y` without leaving a remainder. 

The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` could be zero. If `y` is zero initially, the function directly returns `x`. If `x` is zero and `y` is non-zero, the function will eventually set `x` to `y` when `y` is non-zero and then proceed to compute the GCD.

There are no explicit missing functionalities in the provided code, and the annotations correctly reflect the state of the program after the function concludes.
