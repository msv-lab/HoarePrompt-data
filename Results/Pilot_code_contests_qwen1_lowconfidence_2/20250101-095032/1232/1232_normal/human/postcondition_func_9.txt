The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the expression `return x and not x & x - 1` to achieve this. This expression evaluates to `True` only when `x` is 0 because for any positive integer, `x & (x - 1)` is always non-zero, making `not x & x - 1` evaluate to `False`. Thus, the overall functionality is to check if the input `x` is zero and return the appropriate boolean value.
