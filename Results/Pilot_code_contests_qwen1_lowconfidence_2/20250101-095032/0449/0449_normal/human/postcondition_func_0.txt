The function reads an integer \( n \) and \( n \) space-separated integers \( r_i \) as input, where \( n \) represents the number of concentric circles and \( r_i \) represents their radii. It then calculates the sum of the areas of the circles, considering only those areas whose indices are even (starting from 0), and multiplies the result by \( \pi \). If \( n \) is less than 1, the function outputs 0 and exits immediately.
