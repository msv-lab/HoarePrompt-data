#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.
def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if (nCircles < 1) :
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nCircles` is an integer. If `nCircles` is less than 1, then the condition is met. There is no alternative action specified for the else part, implying no change to the variables if the condition is not met.
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` is a list containing the areas of circles with radii specified in the input string, `input` is an empty string.
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` is a list of circle areas sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is the sum of selected areas based on the parity of the index, and `index` is the last executed index.
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and \( n \) space-separated integers \( r_i \) as input, where \( n \) represents the number of concentric circles and \( r_i \) represents their radii. It then calculates the sum of the areas of the circles, considering only those areas whose indices are even (starting from 0), and multiplies the result by \( \pi \). If \( n \) is less than 1, the function outputs 0 and exits immediately.
