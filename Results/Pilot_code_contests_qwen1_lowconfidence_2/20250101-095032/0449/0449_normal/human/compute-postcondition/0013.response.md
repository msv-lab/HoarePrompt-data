Output State: **`nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` is a list containing the areas of circles with radii specified in the input string, `input` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate as long as there are more values in the `input` string.
- Each iteration processes one value from the `input` string, calculates its corresponding circle area, and appends it to the `areas` list.
- The loop stops when there are no more values in the `input` string.
- Since `nCircles` is initially an integer less than 1 and no changes are made to it within the loop, it remains less than 1 throughout the loop.
- After all iterations, the `areas` list will contain the areas of circles corresponding to each radius specified in the `input` string.
- Once all values are processed, the `input` string becomes empty.
