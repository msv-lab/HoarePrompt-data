`areas` appends the value of `int(radius) * int(radius)`. Since `radius` is an input value, its exact numerical value is not known, but it is converted to an integer before squaring. The length of `areas` increases by one. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nCircles` is still less than 1; `areas` now contains five elements; `input` has at least two values left to be processed.**
