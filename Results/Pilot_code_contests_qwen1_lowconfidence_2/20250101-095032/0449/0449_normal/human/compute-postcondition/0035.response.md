`totalArea` is multiplied by `math.pi`. The value of `math.pi` is approximately 3.14159. Since `totalArea` is the sum of selected areas based on the parity of the index, it retains its original value, but now it is multiplied by `math.pi`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` is a list of circle areas sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is the sum of selected areas based on the parity of the index multiplied by `math.pi`, and `index` is the last executed index.**
