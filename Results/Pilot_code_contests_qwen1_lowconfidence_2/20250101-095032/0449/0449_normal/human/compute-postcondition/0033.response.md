Postcondition: ***`nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` is a list of circle areas sorted in ascending order and has at least 4 elements, `input` is an empty string, and `totalArea` is updated based on the following conditions: if `index` is 2 or 4, `totalArea` is the initial value plus the current `area`; otherwise, `totalArea` is either `areas[1] + areas[2]` or `2 * (areas[3] - areas[2]) + (areas[4] - areas[3])`, depending on whether `index` is 2 or 4.***
