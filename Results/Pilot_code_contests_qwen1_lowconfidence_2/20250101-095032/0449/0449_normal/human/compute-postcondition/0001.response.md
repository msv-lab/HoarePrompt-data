Postcondition: ***The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique. `nCircles` is the integer read from the first line of input. The current value of `nCircles` is less than 1.***
