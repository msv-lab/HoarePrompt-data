The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, specifically:
- The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.

After processing this input, the function does not return any value directly but is expected to perform some operation based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and `n` space-separated integers `ri` as input, where `n` represents the number of concentric circles and `ri` represents their radii.**
