The code `sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')` writes the value of `totalArea` to the standard output and adds a newline character. However, this does not change the value of any variables. The value of `totalArea` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`nCircles`, `areas`, `input`, and `index`) also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` is a list of circle areas sorted in ascending order, `input` is an empty string, `totalArea` is the sum of selected areas based on the parity of the index multiplied by `math.pi`, and `index` is the last executed index.**
