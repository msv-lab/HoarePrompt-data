The code `sys.stdout.write('0\n')` writes the string '0' to the standard output and does not affect the variables `nCircles` or the list of radii. The initial state is that `nCircles` is less than 1, and the input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of concentric circles, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles.

After executing the code, the value of `nCircles` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it. The output written to the standard output does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **`nCircles` is less than 1**
