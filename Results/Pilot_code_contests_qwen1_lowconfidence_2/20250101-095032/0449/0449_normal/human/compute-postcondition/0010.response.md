The code `areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))` appends the area of the circle calculated from the current `radius` to the list `areas`. Since `radius` is converted to an integer before being squared, the new element added to `areas` will be the square of the current `radius`.

Given the initial state:
- `nCircles` is still less than 1.
- `areas` now contains two elements: the area of the circle with the first radius and the area of the circle with the second radius.
- `input` has at least one value left to be processed, meaning there are at least two values in the input string.

After executing the code, the list `areas` will have three elements: the areas of the circles with the first two radii, plus the area of the circle with the current `radius`.

Output State: **`nCircles` is still less than 1, `areas` now contains three elements (the area of the circle with the first radius, the area of the circle with the second radius, and the area of the circle with the current radius), `input` has at least one value left to be processed.**
