The code reads an integer `nCircles` from the standard input, which represents the number of concentric circles. The variable `nCircles` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input. The second line of input is not processed by this snippet of code, so the radii of the circles remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique; `nCircles` is the integer read from the first line of input.**
