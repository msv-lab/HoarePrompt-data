The code `final_scores[name] += score` increments the value associated with the key `name` in the `final_scores` dictionary by the value of `score`. However, the initial state does not specify what `name` and `score` are. Given this, let's assume `name` is a string and `score` is an integer.

- `n` remains unchanged and is the integer input by the user.
- `rounds` remains unchanged and is a list of tuples.
- `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values initialized to 0. After executing the code, the value associated with the key `name` in `final_scores` will be incremented by `score`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values initialized to 0, the value associated with the key `name` in `final_scores` is incremented by `score`.**
