The code initializes a list of rounds where each round is represented by a player's name and their score. The `rounds` list is populated by taking `n` inputs, each consisting of a player's name and a score. This means that `rounds` is now a list of lists, where each inner list contains a player's name (a string) and their score (an integer).

Given this, the only variable affected by the code is `rounds`. The values of `n` and the initial conditions of the players' scores remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of lists where each inner list contains a player's name and their score.**
