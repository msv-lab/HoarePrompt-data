The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. The input consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The rounds are listed in chronological order. It is guaranteed that at the end of the game, at least one player has a positive number of points, and if multiple players have the maximum number of points, the winner is the one who first reached that score.

The function processes this input and returns the name of the player who has the highest score at the end of the game. If there is a tie for the highest score, the function returns the name of the player who first reached that score.
