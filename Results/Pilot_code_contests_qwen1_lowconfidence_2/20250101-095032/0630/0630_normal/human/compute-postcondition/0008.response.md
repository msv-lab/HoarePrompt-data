According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rounds`. For the loop to execute again, the `rounds` list must contain at least two tuples. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, and `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values initialized to 0. The loop increments `final_scores[name]` by `score`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rounds` must contain at least three tuples because it must already contain at least two tuples from the previous iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples that must contain at least three tuples, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values initialized to 0**
