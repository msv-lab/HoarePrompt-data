The code creates a set named `winner_candidates` which contains players whose scores are equal to the maximum score (`m`) found in `final_scores`. This does not change the values of `n`, `rounds`, or `final_scores`, but it sets `winner_candidates` based on the condition provided.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values representing the total scores accumulated for each player, `m` is the maximum value among the values in `final_scores`, `winner_candidates` is a set containing players whose scores are equal to `m`.**
