You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The rounds are listed in chronological order. It is guaranteed that at the end of the game, at least one player has a positive number of points, and if multiple players have the maximum number of points, the winner is the one who first reached that score.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    rounds = [input().split() for _ in range(n)]
    rounds = [(name, int(score)) for name, score in rounds]
    final_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        final_scores[name] += score
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values representing the total scores accumulated for each player, where each value is the sum of all scores associated with the respective player's name in `rounds`.
    m = max(final_scores.values())
    winner_candidates = {player for player, score in final_scores.items() if 
    score == m}
    curr_scores = defaultdict(int)
    for (name, score) in rounds:
        curr_scores[name] += score
        
        if curr_scores[name] >= m and name in winner_candidates:
            print(name)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `rounds` is a list of tuples, and the loop has processed all tuples.
    #- `curr_scores[name]` is the cumulative score for each player `name` as updated by the loop.
    #- If the loop printed any name, it means that player's score has reached or exceeded `m` and the player is in `winner_candidates`.
    #- `final_scores` remains unchanged and still holds the total scores for each player.
    #- `m` remains the maximum value among the values in `final_scores`.
    #- `winner_candidates` contains the names of players whose scores have reached or exceeded `m`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of text, each containing a player's name and a score. It returns the name of the player who has the highest score at the end of the game, or the name of the player who first reached the highest score in case of a tie.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
