The code creates a new dictionary called `final_scores` using `defaultdict(int)`. This means that `final_scores` is a dictionary where each key is associated with an integer value, initialized to 0 by default. No changes are made to the values of `n` or `rounds`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `rounds` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a player's name (a string) and their score (an integer); `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values initialized to 0.**
