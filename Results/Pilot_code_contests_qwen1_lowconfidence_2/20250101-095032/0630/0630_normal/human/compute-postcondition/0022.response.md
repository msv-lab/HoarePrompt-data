The code `print(name)` simply prints the value of the variable `name`. However, the value of `name` is not specified in the initial state, nor is it assigned a value within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the print statement itself, which does not affect the values of any variables.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `curr_scores[name]` is the original value plus `score`, `name` is printed**
