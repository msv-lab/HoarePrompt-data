The code `print(name)` prints the value of the variable `name`. However, this does not assign any new value to any variable. Therefore, the only change is that the value of `name` is printed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `curr_scores[name]` is increased by `score`, `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m`, and `name` is in `winner_candidates`, `name` is printed**
