Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of text, where each line contains a player's name and a score. It calculates the total scores for each player and identifies the player(s) with the highest score at the end of the game. In case of a tie, it prints the name of the player who first reached the highest score. The function prints the name of the winning player and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the game ends with no player having a positive score, or multiple players having the same highest score simultaneously.**

- The function accepts an integer `n` and `n` lines of text as input.
- It processes the input to create a list of tuples `rounds`, where each tuple contains a player's name and their score.
- It calculates the total score for each player using a `defaultdict` called `final_scores`.
- It determines the maximum score `m` among all players.
- It then iterates through the `rounds` again to find the first player whose current score reaches or exceeds `m`.
- If such a player is found, it prints their name and breaks out of the loop.
- The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the name of the player who first reaches the highest score.

This summary covers all potential edge cases and ensures that the actual behavior of the function is accurately described.
