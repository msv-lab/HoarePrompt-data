The code `final_scores[name] += score` increments the value associated with the key `name` in the dictionary `final_scores` by the value of `score`. The variables `rounds` and `n` are not affected by this line of code. 

Since the initial state includes that `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values initialized to 0, and `name` and `score` are parts of the initial state but their specific values are not given, we will keep them in their general form.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values initialized to 0, `final_scores[name]` is incremented by `score`**
