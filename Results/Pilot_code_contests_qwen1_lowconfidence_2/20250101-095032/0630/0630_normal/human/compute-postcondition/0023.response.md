The code `break` is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, it would exit the loop or match statement it is inside. However, since there is no loop or match statement in the given code snippet, and no further context about the surrounding code, we assume it breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match statement. Given the initial state, no variables are modified, and the break statement itself does not affect the variables directly.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `curr_scores[name]` is the original value plus `score`, `name` is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or match statement.**
