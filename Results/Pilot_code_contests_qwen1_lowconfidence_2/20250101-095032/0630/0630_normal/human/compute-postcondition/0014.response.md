To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

1. **Variables involved**: The loop iterates over `rounds`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a `name` and a `score`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `rounds` must contain at least one tuple. If `rounds` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n`: This variable is provided but does not directly affect the loop's execution condition.
   - `rounds`: Must have at least one element to allow the loop to execute.
   - `final_scores`: Its state is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
   - `m`: This is derived from `final_scores` but not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
   - `winner_candidates`: Also derived from `final_scores` but not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
   - `curr_scores`: Its state is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `rounds` has at least one tuple.

State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple**.
