The code `curr_scores[name] += score` updates the value of `curr_scores[name]` by adding `score` to it. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `name`, `curr_scores`, or `score`. The only information given is that `rounds` is a list of tuples and must have at least one tuple. 

Since no specific values are provided for `name`, `curr_scores`, or `score`, the output state will reflect that these variables have been updated in place without specifying their exact new values.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `curr_scores[name]` is increased by `score`**
