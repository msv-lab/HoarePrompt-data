The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the integer entered by the user, while no other variables are affected.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The rounds are listed in chronological order. It is guaranteed that at the end of the game, at least one player has a positive number of points, and if multiple players have the maximum number of points, the winner is the one who first reached that score.; `n` is the integer input by the user.**
