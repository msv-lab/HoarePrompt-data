Postcondition: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples. If `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m` and `name` is in `winner_candidates`, then `name` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or match statement. If the condition is not met, the program continues as normal.**
