`curr_scores[name]` is assigned the value of `curr_scores[name] + score`. However, since `name` and `score` are from the next tuple in the list `rounds`, their specific values are not provided initially. Therefore, the only affected variable is `curr_scores[name]`, which is incremented by `score`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `curr_scores[name]` is updated to its current value plus `score`, `name` and `score` are from the next tuple in the list `rounds`**
