The code transforms the `rounds` list of tuples into a list of tuples where each tuple contains a player's name and their score as integers. This means that each `score` in the `rounds` list is converted from a string to an integer. 

The output state after executing this code is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user; `rounds` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a player's name (a string) and their score (an integer)**
