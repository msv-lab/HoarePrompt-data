The code initializes a new `defaultdict` named `curr_scores` with an integer default factory. This means that `curr_scores` is now a dictionary where each key maps to an integer value, and any key that hasn't been set yet will default to 0.

- `n` remains unchanged as it was not referenced in the code.
- `rounds` remains unchanged.
- `final_scores` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `winner_candidates` remains unchanged.

Since no variables were updated or calculated in this code snippet, the only thing that happened is the creation of a new `defaultdict`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values representing the total scores accumulated for each player, `m` is the maximum value among the values in `final_scores`, `winner_candidates` is a set containing players whose scores are equal to `m`, `curr_scores` is a defaultdict with an integer default factory.**
