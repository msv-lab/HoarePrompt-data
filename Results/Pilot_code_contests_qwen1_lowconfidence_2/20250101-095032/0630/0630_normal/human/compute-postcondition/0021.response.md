The code snippet `curr_scores[name] += score` indicates that the value associated with the key `name` in the dictionary `curr_scores` is incremented by `score`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `curr_scores`, `name`, or `score`. Therefore, we can only state that `curr_scores[name]` has been updated by adding `score` to its current value.

Given the initial state where `rounds` is a list of tuples (which is not directly affected by the given code snippet), the output state will reflect the change in `curr_scores`.

Output State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `curr_scores[name]` is the original value plus `score`**
