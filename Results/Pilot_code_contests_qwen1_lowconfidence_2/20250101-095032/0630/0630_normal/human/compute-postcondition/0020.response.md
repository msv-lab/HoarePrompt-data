Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple.
  - `curr_scores[name]` is increased by `score`.
  - If `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m` and `name` is in `winner_candidates`, then no change occurs. Otherwise, the condition remains as it is.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(name, score)` in the `rounds` list.
   - For each tuple, `curr_scores[name]` is updated by adding `score`.

2. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are more tuples in the `rounds` list to process.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop continues based on the number of tuples remaining in `rounds`, we need to ensure that the `rounds` list has at least one more tuple for the next iteration.
   - If there is only one tuple left, the loop will stop after processing that tuple.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `rounds` must have at least one tuple.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `rounds` must have at least two tuples (one for the current iteration and one for the next).

### Conclusion:
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `rounds` should have at least two tuples.

### Final State:
State: **`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples.**

This ensures that the loop can continue to the next iteration.
