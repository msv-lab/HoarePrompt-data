`m` is assigned the maximum value among the values in `final_scores`. The value of `m` is the highest score accumulated by any player. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values representing the total scores accumulated for each player, and `m` is the maximum value among the values in `final_scores`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `rounds` is a list of tuples, `final_scores` is a defaultdict with keys as strings and values representing the total scores accumulated for each player, `m` is the maximum value among the values in `final_scores`.**
