Postcondition: ***`rounds` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples. `curr_scores[name]` is updated to its current value plus `score` if `curr_scores[name]` is greater than or equal to `m` and `name` is in `winner_candidates`. Otherwise, `curr_scores[name]` is updated to its current value plus `score`, `name` and `score` are from the next tuple in the list `rounds`, and the console does not print anything.***
