The input consists of an integer n followed by n lines of text. Each line contains a player's name (a string of lower-case Latin letters with the length from 1 to 32) and a score (an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive), representing the points gained or lost in each round. The name and score are separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that at the end of the game, at least one player has a positive number of points, and the number of rounds played is between 1 and 1000.
