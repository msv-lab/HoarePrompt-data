Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the rules described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of rounds.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input in the format "name score", storing them in the `rounds` list. This correctly captures the input data structure.

2. **Calculating Final Scores**:
   - The `final_scores` dictionary accumulates the total points for each player across all rounds.
   - This ensures that the final score for each player is calculated accurately.

3. **Identifying Winner Candidates**:
   - After calculating the final scores, the program determines the maximum score (`m`) and finds all players who have this score (`winner_candidates`).
   - This step correctly identifies the players who have the highest score at the end of the game.

4. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program then iterates over the rounds again to find the first player among `winner_candidates` who has a score of at least `m`.
   - If such a player is found, their name is printed immediately, ensuring that the winner is the one who first reached the highest score.
   - If no player reaches the required score, no name is printed, which aligns with the requirement that at least one player should have a positive score at the end.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the scenario where multiple players have the same highest score by identifying the first one to reach that score.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the game ends with at least one player having a positive score.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
