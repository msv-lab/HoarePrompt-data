Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input to calculate the final scores of each player and identifies the player(s) with the highest score. In case of a tie, it determines the player who first reached the highest score. The code handles all potential cases as described:

1. It correctly calculates the final scores for each player.
2. It identifies the maximum score accurately.
3. It checks which player first reached the highest score in case of a tie.
4. It handles the scenario where multiple players have the same highest score and prints the first one who reached that score.

Since the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct.
