The function processes an input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of text, where each line contains a player's name and a score. It calculates the total scores for each player and identifies the player(s) with the highest score at the end of the game. In case of a tie, it prints the name of the player who first reached the highest score. The function prints the name of the winning player and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the game ends with no player having a positive score, or multiple players having the same highest score simultaneously.
