Output State: **`dice1.top` is the value of the top face of `dice1` after rolling 4 times in the 'SWN' direction, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is `0`, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers` because the condition `dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers` was true for all iterations of the loop.**
