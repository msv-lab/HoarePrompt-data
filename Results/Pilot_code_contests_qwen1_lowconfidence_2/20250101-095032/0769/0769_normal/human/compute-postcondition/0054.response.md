Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step and determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `dice1.top` is `i + 1`.
- `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.

### Code of the Loop
```python
for j in range(4):
    dice1.roll_dice('SWN')
    if dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers:
        flag = True
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Iteration Analysis**:
   - The loop runs 4 times because `j` ranges from 0 to 3.
   - In each iteration, `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is called, which changes the top value of `dice1`.
   - The condition `if dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers:` checks if the numbers on `dice1` match those on `dice2`.
   - If the condition is true, `flag` is set to `True`. Otherwise, it remains `True` (since no else part is provided).

2. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - Since the loop runs exactly 4 times, `j` will be 3 at the end.
   - The value of `dice1.top` will change after each call to `roll_dice('SWN')`. However, we don't know the exact values, only that they are determined by the function `roll_dice`.
   - `dice2` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `flag` will be `True` after all 4 iterations, as the condition is checked every time and `flag` is set to `True` if the condition is met at any point. Even if the condition is never met, `flag` remains `True` due to the lack of an else part.
   - `j` will be 3 after the loop completes.

### Final Output State
Since the loop runs 4 times and the condition is checked each time, `flag` will be `True` regardless of whether the condition is met or not. The values of `dice1.top` will have changed after each roll, but the exact values depend on the implementation of `roll_dice`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`dice1.top` is the value determined by `roll_dice('SWN')` after 4 iterations, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is 3, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.**
