Postcondition: ***`dice1.top` is updated based on the roll 'SWN', `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is 0, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`. If `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers`, all these conditions remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition's outcome.***
