The code provided is a docstring for a function that compares two dice to check if they are equal. However, the actual function implementation is missing. Based on the given initial state and the code snippet, no variables are being modified or returned by the function. The function itself does not execute any operations that would alter the state of the variables.

Output State: **`dice1` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive**
