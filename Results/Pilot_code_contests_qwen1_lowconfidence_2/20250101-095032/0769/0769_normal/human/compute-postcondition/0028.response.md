Postcondition: ***`dice1.top` is the new top face value after rolling, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` remains `True`, `j` is `0`, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`. Since the if condition is met, `dice1.numbers` equals `dice2.numbers` and no other changes occur in the else part.***
