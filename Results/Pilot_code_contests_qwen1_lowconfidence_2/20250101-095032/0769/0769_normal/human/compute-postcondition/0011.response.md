Postcondition: ***`dice1`'s top face is either 1, 2, or 3, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is 0, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`. If the condition `dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers` is false, the values of `flag`, `j`, and the relationship between `dice1.numbers` and `dice2.numbers` remain unchanged.***
