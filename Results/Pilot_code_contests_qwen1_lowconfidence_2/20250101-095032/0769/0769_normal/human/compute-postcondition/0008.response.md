The method `roll_dice('SWN')` on `dice1` changes the top face value of `dice1`. The initial top face of `dice1` is `i + 1`. After rolling, the top face value of `dice1` will be one of the values in the set {'S', 'W', 'N'}, which means it will be one of 1, 2, or 3 (assuming 'S', 'W', 'N' map to these values).

Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`dice1`'s top face is either 1, 2, or 3, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `False`, `j` is 0**
