The code sets `flag` to `True`, which is its initial value. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`dice1.top` is a new value after rolling in the 'SWN' direction, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `j` is 2, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`**
