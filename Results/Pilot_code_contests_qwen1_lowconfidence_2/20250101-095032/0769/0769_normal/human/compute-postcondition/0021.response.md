The method `roll_dice('S')` is called on `dice1`. This method typically rolls the dice and updates the top face of `dice1`. Since the exact implementation of `roll_dice` is not provided, we assume it updates `dice1`'s top face to a random value from 1 to 3. 

Given the initial state, `dice1`'s top face was a random value from 1 to 3, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is 3, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.

After calling `dice1.roll_dice('S')`, `dice1`'s top face will be updated to a new random value from 1 to 3.

Output State: **`dice1`'s top face is a random value from 1 to 3, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is 3, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.**
