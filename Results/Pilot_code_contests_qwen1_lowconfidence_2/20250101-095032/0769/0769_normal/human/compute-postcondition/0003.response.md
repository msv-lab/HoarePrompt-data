The code simply reassigns the value of `flag` to `True`, which was already its initial value. Therefore, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Output State: **`dice1` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True**
