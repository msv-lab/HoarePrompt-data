The method `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is called, which likely rolls the dice in the specified directions ('SWN' could mean South, West, North). However, without knowing the exact behavior of the `roll_dice` method, we can infer that the top value of `dice1` will change based on the roll. Since `dice1.top` was a new value after rolling initially, it will now be updated to a new value after the roll in the 'SWN' direction. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1.top` is a new value after rolling in the 'SWN' direction, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `j` is 2, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`**
