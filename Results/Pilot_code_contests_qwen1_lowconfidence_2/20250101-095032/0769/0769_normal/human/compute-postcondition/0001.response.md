The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `flag`. This does not affect the values of `dice1` and `dice2`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`dice1` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is False**
