The code `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is executed, which typically rolls the dice in the specified directions ('SWN'). However, since the exact behavior of `roll_dice` is not specified in the problem statement, we will assume that rolling the dice changes the top face of `dice1` to a new random value from the set {1, 2, 3} and does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `dice1`'s top face is either 1, 2, or 3.
- `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `j` is 1.
- `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.

After executing `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`, the top face of `dice1` will change to a new random value from the set {1, 2, 3}, but we do not know the specific value it will take. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1`'s top face is 1, 2, or 3 (new random value), `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is 1, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.**
