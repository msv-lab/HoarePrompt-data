The method `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is called, which likely represents a roll of the dice in the specified directions ('S', 'W', 'N'). However, without specific details about how `roll_dice` works, we can infer that this action changes the top face of `dice1`. Since the initial state of `dice1.top` is `i + 1`, after rolling the dice, `dice1.top` will be updated to the new top face value, which is not explicitly defined by the method call itself.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `dice2` remains a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive.
- `flag` remains `True`.
- `j` remains `0`.
- `dice1.numbers` remains equal to `dice2.numbers`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`dice1.top` is the new top face value after rolling, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is `0`, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.**
