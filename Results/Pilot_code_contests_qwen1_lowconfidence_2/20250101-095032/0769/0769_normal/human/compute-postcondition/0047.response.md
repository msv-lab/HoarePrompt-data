`dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is called, which means the top value of `dice1` will be updated based on the roll 'SWN'. However, the exact new value of `dice1.top` is not specified, so we can only state that it has been updated. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dice1.top` is updated based on the roll 'SWN'; `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive; `flag` is `True`; `j` is 0; `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.
