`dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` changes the top face of `dice1` based on the roll direction 'SWN'. However, the exact new value of `dice1.top` depends on the current value of `dice1.top` (which is `i + 1`) and the roll outcome. Since the roll outcome is not specified, we can only say that `dice1.top` will change, but its new value cannot be determined without knowing the roll result.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `dice2` remains a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive.
- `flag` remains `True`.
- `j` must still be less than 4.
- `dice1.numbers` remains equal to `dice2.numbers`.

Output State: **`dice1.top` changes from `i + 1` to a new value based on the roll 'SWN', `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` must be less than 4, `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`**
