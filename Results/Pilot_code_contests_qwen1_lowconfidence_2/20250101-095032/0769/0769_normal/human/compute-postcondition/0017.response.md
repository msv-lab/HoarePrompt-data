The method `roll_dice('SWN')` is called on `dice1`. This method typically rolls the dice in the directions specified by 'SWN', which stands for South, West, and North. However, since the exact implementation of `roll_dice` is not provided, we assume it changes the top face of `dice1` to a new random value from 1 to 3.

Given the initial state:
- `dice1`'s top face is 1, 2, or 3 (new random value)
- `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive
- `flag` is `True`
- `j` is 2
- `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`

After calling `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')`, `dice1`'s top face will be a new random value from 1 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1`'s top face is a new random value from 1 to 3, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `j` is 2, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.**
