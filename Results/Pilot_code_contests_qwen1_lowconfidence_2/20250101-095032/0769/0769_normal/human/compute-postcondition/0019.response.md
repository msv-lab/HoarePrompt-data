Postcondition: ***`dice1`'s top face is a new random value from 1 to 3, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `j` is 2, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers.*** 

Since there is no else part in the if-else block, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition `dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers` is true.
