Postcondition: **`dice1` and `dice2` are lists of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True. If `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`, `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, after rolling `dice1` in the 'S' direction six times, `dice1.numbers` becomes equal to `dice2.numbers`, and `flag` remains True.**
