The code simply reassigns `flag` to `True`, which does not change its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1`'s top face is a new random value from 1 to 3, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `j` is 2, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers.`**
