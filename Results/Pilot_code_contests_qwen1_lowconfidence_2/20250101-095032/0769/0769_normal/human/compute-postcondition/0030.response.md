The method `dice1.roll_dice('SWN')` is called, which likely rotates the dice faces based on the directions 'SWN'. However, without specific details on how `dice1.roll_dice` functionally works, we can only state that the top face value of `dice1` will change, and the other conditions remain the same.

Given the initial state:
- `dice1.top` is the new top face value after rolling.
- `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive.
- `flag` remains `True`.
- `j` is 1.
- `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.

After the roll, `dice1.top` will be updated to a new value, but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specifics of the roll function. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dice1.top` is a new value after rolling, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers`.**
