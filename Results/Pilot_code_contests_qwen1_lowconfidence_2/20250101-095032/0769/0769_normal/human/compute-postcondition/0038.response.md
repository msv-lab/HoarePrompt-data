The code `dice1.roll_dice('S')` rolls the dice1 object in the 'S' (South) direction. This changes the value of the top face of `dice1`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of the top face after rolling 4 times in the 'SWN' direction, we denote it as the new value after the South roll.

Other variables are not affected by this roll command. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dice1.top` is the new value after rolling in the 'S' direction, `dice2` is a list of six integers each in the range 0 to 100 inclusive, `flag` is `True`, `j` is `0`, and `dice1.numbers` is equal to `dice2.numbers` because the condition `dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers` was true for all iterations of the loop.**
