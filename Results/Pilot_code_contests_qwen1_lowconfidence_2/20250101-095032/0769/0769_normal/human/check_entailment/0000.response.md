Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to determine if the dices are all different using the rules from Dice III. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if two dices are the same by rolling the first dice to try to match the top face of the second dice. However, the logic for rolling the dice is flawed. 

For instance, consider the following scenario:
- Dice 1 with faces: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Dice 2 with faces: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The program will incorrectly determine that these dices are the same because it only checks a limited number of rotations and does not cover all possible orientations of the dices.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all possible orientations of the dices are checked. This involves rotating the dice in all possible ways to ensure that no two dices are considered the same if their faces can be rearranged to match each other.
