Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully implement the required logic to determine if the dices are all different according to the rules specified in Dice III. Specifically, the code uses a method (`func_1`) to check if one dice can be rolled into another, but it does not properly handle the requirement that the dices must be distinct. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if `dice1` can be rolled into `dice2` by performing up to six possible rotations. However, it does not account for the possibility that the dices are inherently different based on their initial configurations.
   - The function only checks if `dice1` can be made to look like `dice2` by rotating it. It does not check if the dices are fundamentally different, which is required by the problem statement.

2. **Lack of Distinctiveness Check:**
   - The main program logic iterates over pairs of dices and uses `func_1` to check if they are the same. However, `func_1` only checks if one dice can be rolled to look like the other, not if they are fundamentally different.
   - This means that if two dices have the same configuration, `func_1` will return `True`, indicating they are the same, even though the problem requires them to be distinct.

3. **Example of Failure:**
   - Consider two dices with identical configurations. The program would incorrectly identify them as the same, even though they should be different based on the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all dices are checked for fundamental differences using the rules of Dice III. This involves comparing the dices in a way that ensures they cannot be transformed into each other by any sequence of rolls.

Since the current implementation does not fully address the requirement, the program is **incorrect**.
