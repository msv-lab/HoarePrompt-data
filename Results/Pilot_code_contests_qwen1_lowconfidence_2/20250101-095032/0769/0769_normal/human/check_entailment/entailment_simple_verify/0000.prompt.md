You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a program which reads $n$ dices constructed in the same way as Dice I, and determines whether they are all different. For the determination, use the same way as Dice III.

Constraints

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to determine if the dices are all different using the rules from Dice III. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if two dices are the same by rolling the first dice to try to match the top face of the second dice. However, the logic for rolling the dice is flawed. 

For instance, consider the following scenario:
- Dice 1 with faces: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Dice 2 with faces: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The program will incorrectly determine that these dices are the same because it only checks a limited number of rotations and does not cover all possible orientations of the dices.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all possible orientations of the dices are checked. This involves rotating the dice in all possible ways to ensure that no two dices are considered the same if their faces can be rearranged to match each other.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
