Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not properly determine whether all given dices are different using the rules specified in Dice III.

1. **Problem Description Requirements:**
   - The program should read \( n \) dices, each defined by six integers representing the faces of the dice.
   - It needs to determine if all dices are different by comparing them according to the rules specified in Dice III.
   - If all dices are different, it should print "Yes", otherwise "No".

2. **Annotated Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a class `Dice` to represent a single die and includes methods for rotating the die in various directions.
   - The main logic is in the `func_1` function, which attempts to check if two dice are equivalent by rotating one of them and checking if the faces match.
   - However, the `func_1` function incorrectly assumes that if any rotation of one die matches the other die, the two dice are equivalent. This is not accurate according to the rules of Dice III.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if the initial orientation of the dice is the same. If not, it rotates the first die up to 6 times (one full rotation) in specific directions (`SWN`) and checks if it matches the second die.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not cover all possible orientations that could make the dice appear different. According to Dice III rules, a die can be rotated in many ways to look different, and simply rotating one die 6 times is insufficient.

4. **Example Case:**
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     3
     1 2 3 4 5 6
     6 2 4 3 5 1
     6 5 4 3 2 1
     ```
   - According to the problem description, these three dices are not all different because the second and third dices can be obtained from the first by rotations. However, the annotated program would incorrectly determine them as different.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly implement the logic, the program needs to ensure that no two dices can be transformed into each other by any sequence of allowed moves. This involves checking all possible orientations and ensuring that no two dices can be aligned by rotations.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it fails to accurately determine if the dices are all different according to the rules specified in Dice III. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
