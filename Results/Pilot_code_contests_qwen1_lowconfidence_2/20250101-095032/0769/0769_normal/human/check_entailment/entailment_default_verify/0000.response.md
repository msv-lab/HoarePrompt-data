Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` does not correctly check all possible orientations of the dices to determine if they are different. Specifically, the function only rolls the first dice in the 'S' direction up to six times, which is insufficient to cover all possible orientations. The provided output hints also confirm that the function does not handle all cases correctly, as it fails to check all possible configurations of the dices. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to an incorrect assessment.
