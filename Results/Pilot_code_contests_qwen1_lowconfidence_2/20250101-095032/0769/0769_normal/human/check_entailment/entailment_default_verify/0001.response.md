Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all possible rotations of the dice faces correctly. The provided output hints further confirm that the function `func_1` only checks the initial configuration and does not account for all possible rotations of the dice. Specifically, the function only rolls the dice in the 'S' direction and does not consider other valid rotations such as 'N', 'E', and 'W'. Therefore, the program may fail to identify equivalent dice configurations that are rotations of each other.

To accurately determine if two dice are the same, the program should consider all possible orientations of the dice, including all six faces and their permutations. Since the current implementation is insufficient, the program cannot guarantee correctness based on the problem description.
