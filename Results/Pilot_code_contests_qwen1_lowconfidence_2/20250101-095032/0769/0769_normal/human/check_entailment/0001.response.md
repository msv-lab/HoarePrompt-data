Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all possible rotations of the dice faces correctly. Specifically, the `func_1` function checks if two dice are identical by setting the top face of `dice1` to each of the six possible values and then rotating it to check if it matches `dice2`. However, this approach might miss some configurations due to the way the dice faces are manipulated.

Consider the following case:
- Dice 1: Faces are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Dice 2: Faces are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` but with the faces rotated differently.

For example, if Dice 1 has faces `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and Dice 2 has faces `[1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2]`, the program will not correctly identify them as the same because the `func_1` function only checks the initial configuration and does not account for all possible rotations.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all possible orientations of the dice are checked. This can be done by considering all permutations of the faces and checking if the faces match after accounting for rotations.
