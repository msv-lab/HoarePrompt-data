Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the requirement to determine if the given dices are all different. The function `func_1` checks if two dices can be made identical by rolling one of them, but the logic for determining if dices are all different is flawed.

Specifically, the main issue lies in how the dices are compared. The code uses a series of predefined moves ('SWN') to try to align the faces of the dices, but it does not cover all possible orientations. The function `func_1` only checks if one dice can be rolled in a specific sequence ('SWN') to match the other dice, which is insufficient for determining if two dices are different.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider two dices with the following faces:
- Dice 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Dice 2: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

These dices are clearly different, but the current implementation may incorrectly conclude that they are the same because it does not account for all possible rotations.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible rotations of each die, which requires a more comprehensive approach. Hereâ€™s a simplified version of how this could be done:

```python
from itertools import product

def compare_dices(dice1, dice2):
    for top1 in range(1, 7):
        for front1 in range(1, 7):
            if front1 == top1:
                continue
            # Set top and front of dice1 to match the given values
            dice1.set_top(top1)
            dice1.set_front(front1)
            # Check if dice1 matches dice2
            if dice1.numbers == dice2.numbers:
                return True
    return False

def are_all_different(dices):
    for i in range(len(dices)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(dices)):
            if not compare_dices(dices[i], dices[j]):
                return False
    return True

# Read input and process dices
dice_number = int(input())
dices = [Dice([int(x) for x in input().split()]) for _ in range(dice_number)]

if are_all_different(dices):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This revised code checks all possible orientations of each die before concluding that they are different, ensuring the program works correctly for all potential cases.
