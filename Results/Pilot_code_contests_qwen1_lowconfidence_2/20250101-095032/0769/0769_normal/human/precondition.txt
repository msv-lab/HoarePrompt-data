The function does not take any input parameters directly. Instead, the input is provided through external means such as a file or standard input, and the numbers assigned to the dice faces are stored in a list named `numbers`. The list `numbers` contains the integers assigned to the dice faces for each dice, and it is structured in the same way as described in Dice III.
