Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly count all pairs of opposite numbers. Specifically, the code only considers the counts of positive and negative numbers and does not handle the case where both positive and negative counterparts are zero. The example in the problem description shows that zeros should also form pairs with other zeros. 

For instance, consider the input:

```
5
0 0 0 0 0
```

The correct output should be 10 because each zero can pair with any other zero. However, the given code would only count \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\) pairs using the formula \(a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2\), which is correct for this specific case. But the code does not handle the general case correctly for other inputs where there are both positive and negative counterparts of zero.

The correct implementation should include a separate check for the count of zeros and handle them appropriately. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = int(input())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count occurrences of each number
    for num in t:
        a[num] += 1
    
    ans = 0
    # Calculate pairs of opposite numbers
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    
    # Handle zeros separately
    zeros_count = a[0]
    ans += zeros_count * (zeros_count - 1) // 2
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that all cases, including those with multiple zeros, are handled correctly.
