You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everybody knows that opposites attract. That is the key principle of the "Perfect Matching" dating agency. The "Perfect Matching" matchmakers have classified each registered customer by his interests and assigned to the i-th client number ti ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10). Of course, one number can be assigned to any number of customers.

"Perfect Matching" wants to advertise its services and publish the number of opposite couples, that is, the couples who have opposite values of t. Each couple consists of exactly two clients. The customer can be included in a couple an arbitrary number of times. Help the agency and write the program that will find the sought number by the given sequence t1, t2, ..., tn. For example, if t = (1, - 1, 1, - 1), then any two elements ti and tj form a couple if i and j have different parity. Consequently, in this case the sought number equals 4.

Of course, a client can't form a couple with him/herself.

Input

The first line of the input data contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which represents the number of registered clients of the "Couple Matching". The second line contains a sequence of integers t1, t2, ..., tn ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), ti — is the parameter of the i-th customer that has been assigned to the customer by the result of the analysis of his interests.

Output

Print the number of couples of customs with opposite t. The opposite number for x is number  - x (0 is opposite to itself). Couples that only differ in the clients' order are considered the same.

Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

-3 3 0 0 3


Output

Input

3

Output

3

Note

In the first sample the couples of opposite clients are: (1,2), (1,5) и (3,4).

In the second sample any couple of clients is opposite.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = input()
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `n` (the number of registered clients) is read incorrectly. The program reads `n` as a string and then attempts to use it as an integer without converting it. This will cause a TypeError. To fix this, the program should convert `n` to an integer using `int(input())`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = int(input())  # Convert input to integer
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)

func()
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of integers representing the parameter t for each customer, where the length of the list is at least 1 and at most 100,000, and each element in the list is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive.
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is 0, `t` is a list of integers, and `i` is 10.
    n = input()
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that key appears in the first `n` elements of the list `t`, `t` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that key appears in the first `n` elements of the list `t`, `t` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is 0.
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `t` and counts the number of pairs of positive and negative integers that have equal absolute values. If no such pairs exist, it counts the number of occurrences of zero. The function returns this count as an integer. The function also handles the case where the list is empty by returning 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
