Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly handle the input size `n`. Specifically, the state of the program right before the function call indicates that `n` is read as a string using `input()`, and it is used directly in the `for` loop without conversion to an integer. This will raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a valid integer. The annotation clearly states that `n` is a non-negative integer, and the program uses `n` directly without converting it from a string, which is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect due to the incorrect handling of `n` is valid.
