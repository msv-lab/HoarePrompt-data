You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Everybody knows that opposites attract. That is the key principle of the "Perfect Matching" dating agency. The "Perfect Matching" matchmakers have classified each registered customer by his interests and assigned to the i-th client number ti ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10). Of course, one number can be assigned to any number of customers.

"Perfect Matching" wants to advertise its services and publish the number of opposite couples, that is, the couples who have opposite values of t. Each couple consists of exactly two clients. The customer can be included in a couple an arbitrary number of times. Help the agency and write the program that will find the sought number by the given sequence t1, t2, ..., tn. For example, if t = (1, - 1, 1, - 1), then any two elements ti and tj form a couple if i and j have different parity. Consequently, in this case the sought number equals 4.

Of course, a client can't form a couple with him/herself.

Input

The first line of the input data contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which represents the number of registered clients of the "Couple Matching". The second line contains a sequence of integers t1, t2, ..., tn ( - 10 ≤ ti ≤ 10), ti — is the parameter of the i-th customer that has been assigned to the customer by the result of the analysis of his interests.

Output

Print the number of couples of customs with opposite t. The opposite number for x is number  - x (0 is opposite to itself). Couples that only differ in the clients' order are considered the same.

Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Note

In the first sample the couples of opposite clients are: (1,2), (1,5) и (3,4).

In the second sample any couple of clients is opposite.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of integers representing the parameter t for each customer, where the length of the list is at least 1 and at most 100,000, and each element in the list is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive.
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is 0, `t` is a list of integers, and `i` is 10.
    n = input()
    t = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that key appears in the first `n` elements of the list `t`, `t` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that key appears in the first `n` elements of the list `t`, `t` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is 0.
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `t` and counts the number of pairs of positive and negative integers that have equal absolute values. If no such pairs exist, it counts the number of occurrences of zero. The function returns this count as an integer. The function also handles the case where the list is empty by returning 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
