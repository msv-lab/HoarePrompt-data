Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of opposite couples based on the provided problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible opposite pairs, including those involving the integer `0`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of Zero (`0`):**
   - The program incorrectly treats the integer `0` separately using the line `ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) / 2`. This formula calculates the number of ways to choose 2 zeros out of `a[0]` occurrences, but it should simply be `a[0] * (a[0] - 1) // 2` to get the number of unique pairs of zeros.
   - However, the main issue is that it doesn't account for the fact that any zero can pair with any other zero, and this needs to be added directly without division by 2 (since pairs of zeros are counted individually, not as combinations).

2. **Logic for Non-Zero Values:**
   - The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over a range from `-10` to `0`, but it should iterate over both positive and negative values. It should include both `for i in range(-10, 11)` and check both `a[i] * a[-i]` and `a[-i] * a[i]`.

### Correct Implementation:

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Iterate over the range from `-10` to `10` to ensure all possible values are considered.
- Directly add the count of pairs for zeros without dividing by 2.
- Ensure that the count of pairs for non-zero values is calculated correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    
    n = int(input())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        if i != 0:
            ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) // 2
    
    print(ans)

# Overall this is what the function does:
# The function accepts a list of integers `t` and counts the number of pairs of positive and negative integers that have equal absolute values.
# If no such pairs exist, it counts the number of occurrences of zero.
# The function returns this count as an integer.
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly counts all possible opposite pairs, including those involving the integer `0`, thereby meeting the requirements of the problem description.
