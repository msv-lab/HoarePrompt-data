Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input size `n` might not be provided correctly or the input string might contain spaces between numbers. Additionally, the program uses `input()` and `raw_input()`, which are not standard Python functions (they are from Python 2). In Python 3, we should use `int(input())` and `input().split()` instead.

To fix this, the program should be revised as follows:

```python
def func():
    a = dict()
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        a[i] = 0
    n = int(input())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[t[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(-10, 0):
        ans += a[i] * a[-i]
    ans += a[0] * (a[0] - 1) // 2
    print(ans)
```

However, since the problem statement does not specify whether the code should handle such issues or not, and the original code fails to meet the problem's requirements due to these issues, the correctness is marked as **False**.
