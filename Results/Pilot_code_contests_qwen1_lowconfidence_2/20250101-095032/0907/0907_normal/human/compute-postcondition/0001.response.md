State: **`a` is an empty dictionary, t is a list of integers representing the parameter t for each customer, where the length of the list is at least 1 and at most 100,000, and each element in the list is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive, i is -10**.

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The for loop iterates over the range from -10 to 10 (inclusive). Therefore, the variable `i` must be initialized to -10 at the start of the loop.
2. **List of Integers (`t`)**: The list `t` is given as a parameter for each customer. Although the list itself does not directly affect the loop's execution, it is specified that the list should have a length between 1 and 100,000 and each element in the list is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive.
3. **Dictionary (`a`)**: The dictionary `a` is initially empty. This is already part of the initial state and doesn't need adjustment.

Thus, the key state adjustments needed are ensuring `i` is set to -10, and maintaining the conditions on the list `t`.
