According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -10 to 10 inclusive. The variable `i` is initialized to -9 at the start of the loop, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `a` is `{'-10': 0, '-9': 0}`
- `t` is a list of integers
- `i` is -9

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The value of `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become -8.
2. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be within the range of -10 to 10.

Given that `i` was -9 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be -8. Since -8 is within the range of -10 to 10, the loop will continue executing.

The state of `a` and `t` does not change based on the information given, as the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified that would affect these variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is `{'-10': 0, '-9': 0}`, `t` is a list of integers, `i` is -8**
