The code snippet `t = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `t`. The original values of `a`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

- `a` remains a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is 0.
- `t` gets updated to a list of integers obtained from the user input.
- `i` remains `10`.
- `n` remains an input string.

Output State: **`a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is 0; `t` is a list of integers from the user input; `i` is 10; `n` is an input string**
