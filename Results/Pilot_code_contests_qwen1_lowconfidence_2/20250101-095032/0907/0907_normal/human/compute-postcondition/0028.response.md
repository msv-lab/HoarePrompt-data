Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `t` and counts the number of pairs of positive and negative integers that have equal absolute values. If no such pairs exist, it counts the number of occurrences of zero. The function returns this count as an integer. The function also handles the case where the list is empty by returning 0.**

**Detailed Summary:**
- The function initializes a dictionary `a` with keys ranging from -10 to 10, setting each value to 0.
- It then reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the list `t`.
- The function updates the dictionary `a` to count the occurrences of each integer in the first `n` elements of the list `t`.
- Next, it calculates the sum of the products of the counts of each pair of positive and negative integers that have equal absolute values.
- Finally, it adds half the product of the count of zeros with itself minus one to account for the combinations of zeros.
- The function prints the final result and returns it as the output.

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `t` is empty, the function will return 0 because there are no integers to process.
- If the list contains only zeros, the function will return the number of zeros squared divided by 2 plus zero (if there's only one zero, the result will be 0).
- If there are no pairs of positive and negative integers with equal absolute values, the function will only add the count of zeros to the result.
