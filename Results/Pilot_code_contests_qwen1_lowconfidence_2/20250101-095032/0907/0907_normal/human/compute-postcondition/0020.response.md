According to the code, the loop `for i in range(-10, 0)` iterates over the range of integers from -10 to -1 (inclusive). However, the problem statement explicitly mentions that the loop `for i in range(-10, 0)` will never execute.

Since the loop will never execute, there is no change needed in the states provided at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, all the states remain as they are.

State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that key appears in the first `n` elements of the list `t`, `t` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is 0**
