The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a list of integers. Each element in the list is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive, and the length of the list is at least 1 and at most 100,000. 

Case_1: The function returns the count of positive integers in the list `t`.
Case_2: The function returns the count of negative integers in the list `t`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `t` of integers and return either the count of positive integers or the count of negative integers based on the conditions specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `t` of integers, and returns the count of positive integers in the list if any exist, otherwise it returns the count of negative integers in the list.**
