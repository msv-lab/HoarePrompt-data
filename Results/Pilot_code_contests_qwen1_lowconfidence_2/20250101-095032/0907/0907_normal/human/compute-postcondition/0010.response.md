According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. The initial state provides the following information:

- `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is 0.
- `t` is a list of integers from user input.
- `i` is 10 (this value is irrelevant since the loop uses `n`).
- `n` is an input string.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be converted to an integer and this integer must be non-negative. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the following states:
- `n` should be a non-negative integer.

State: **`a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is 0, `t` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 10, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
