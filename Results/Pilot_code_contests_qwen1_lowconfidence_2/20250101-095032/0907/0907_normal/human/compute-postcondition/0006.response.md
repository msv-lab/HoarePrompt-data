The code assigns the value `0` to `a[i]`, where `i` is `-8`. Given the initial state, `a` is a dictionary with keys `'-10'` and `'-9'` both having a value of `0`, and `i` is `-8`. Since `i` is `-8`, which is not a key in the dictionary `a`, the dictionary `a` remains unchanged. The value of `t` and `i` also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is `{'-10': 0, '-9': 0}`, `t` is a list of integers, `i` is -8**
