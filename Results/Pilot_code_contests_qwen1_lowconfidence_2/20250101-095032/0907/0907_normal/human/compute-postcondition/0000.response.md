The code initializes an empty dictionary `a`. Since no operations are performed on the input list or any other variables, the only change is the creation of the dictionary `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an empty dictionary, the input is a list of integers representing the parameter t for each customer, where the length of the list is at least 1 and at most 100,000, and each element in the list is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive.**
