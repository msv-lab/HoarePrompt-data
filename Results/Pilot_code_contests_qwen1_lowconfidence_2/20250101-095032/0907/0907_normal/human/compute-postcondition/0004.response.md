The code `a[i] = 0` updates the dictionary `a` by setting the value at key `-9` (since `i` is `-9`) to `0`. The initial state shows that `a` is `{'-10': 0}`. After running the code, the dictionary `a` will have two entries: `-10` maps to `0` and `-9` also maps to `0`.

The states of the other variables (`t` and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is `{'-10': 0, '-9': 0}`, `t` is a list of integers, `i` is -9**
