The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans`. The variables `a`, `i`, `n`, and `t` are not affected by this print statement. The calculation of `ans` involves the count of how many times `0` appears in the list `t`, which is stored in `a[0]`. Since the print statement does not alter any variable values, the value of `ans` remains as it was computed before the print statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that key appears in the first `n` elements of the list `t`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is `ans + count_0 * (count_0 - 1) / 2`, where `count_0` is the number of times `0` appears in the list `t`, and `ans` is printed.**

Note: The exact value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as computed before the print statement.
