The code snippet `ans += a[i] * a[-i]` impacts the variable `ans`. Since `i` ranges from -10 to 0 in the loop, the condition `for i in range(-10, 0)` is never executed, which means `i` does not take any value in this range. Thus, the line `ans += a[i] * a[-i]` is also never executed.

Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged at 0, and the other variables' states are unaffected. 

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a dictionary where the keys are integers ranging from -10 to 10, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that key appears in the first `n` elements of the list `t`, `t` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is 0, and the loop `for i in range(-10, 0)` will never execute.**
