According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range from -10 to 10 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `a` is `{'-10': 0}`, `t` is a list of integers, and `i` is -10.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The current value of `i` is -10.
2. The loop will continue if `i` is less than 11.

Since `i` is currently -10, the next value of `i` would be -9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be -9.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

State: **`a` is {'-10': 0}, `t` is a list of integers, `i` is -9**
