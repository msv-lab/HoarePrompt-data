`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. The input is read from `stdin.readline()`, which means `n` and `k` are now integer values obtained from user input. The values of `T` and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ans` is a list containing integers from 1 to k // 2 + 1 followed by integers from k + 1 to n + 1; `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from user input.**
