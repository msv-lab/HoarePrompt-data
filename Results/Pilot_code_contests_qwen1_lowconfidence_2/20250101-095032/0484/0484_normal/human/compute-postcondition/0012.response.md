Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ans` is a list of integers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`, the output is `n - k // 2 + 1` followed by the elements of `ans` joined into a single string separated by spaces.**
