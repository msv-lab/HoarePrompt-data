Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000\). For each test case, it generates a list `ans` containing integers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n`. The function then prints the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` concatenated into a single line separated by spaces. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads the number of test cases `T` (where \(1 \leq T \leq 100\)) from standard input at the beginning. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases, printing the required output for each case.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where `k` is even, ensuring that the range `k // 2 + 1` is inclusive.
- It correctly handles the case where `k` is odd, also ensuring that the range `k // 2 + 1` is inclusive.
- The function ensures that `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges, though no explicit checks are included in the code for these conditions. This means that if `n` or `k` are outside the specified ranges, the behavior is undefined.
- The function correctly handles the scenario where `k` equals `n`, resulting in an empty list `ans`.
- There is no error handling for invalid input types (e.g., non-integer inputs for `n` and `k`).
