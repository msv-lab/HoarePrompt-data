The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the function definition. Instead, it implies that there are test cases where `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000\). The output varies based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes test cases where `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000\). The function returns outputs based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
