The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input using `stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `T`, `n`, and `k` are affected.

- `T` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that `1 ≤ T ≤ 100`.
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input.

Since the input values for `n` and `k` are valid (i.e., `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000`), these constraints are now reflected in the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000**
