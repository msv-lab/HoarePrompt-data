Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is equal to `n`. According to the problem description, we need to choose the maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to `n` such that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to `k`. However, the program always includes all integers from `k+1` to `n` and a subset of integers from `1` to `k//2`, which does not guarantee that no subset of the chosen numbers will sum to `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 5
```
The program outputs:
```
4
4 3 1 2
```
Here, the chosen numbers are `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. The subset `{1, 4}` sums to `5`, which violates the condition that no subset of chosen numbers should sum to `k`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for this case.
