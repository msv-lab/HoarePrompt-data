Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code constructs a list `ans` that includes all integers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by all integers from `k + 1` to `n`. However, this approach does not guarantee that there will be no subset of the chosen numbers with a sum equal to `k`.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \):
- The generated list would be `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.
- The subset `[1, 2]` has a sum of `3`, which is equal to `k`.

This shows that the constructed list may contain subsets whose sum is equal to `k`, violating the problem's requirement. Therefore, the code is incorrect for at least one potential case.
