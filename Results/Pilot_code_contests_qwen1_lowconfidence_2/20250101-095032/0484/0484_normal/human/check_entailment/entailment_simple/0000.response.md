Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to choose the maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to `n` such that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to `k`.
   - The solution uses a simple strategy: select all numbers from 1 to `k // 2` and all numbers from `k + 1` to `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over `T` test cases as expected.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It constructs a list `ans` containing:
     - All numbers from 1 to `k // 2`.
     - All numbers from `k + 1` to `n`.
   - The length of `ans` is `n - k // 2 + 1`, which is the maximum number of chosen integers while ensuring no subset sums to `k`.
   - It prints the length of `ans` and then the elements of `ans` in a space-separated format.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Maximum Number of Chosen Integers**: The selected numbers ensure that no subset can sum to `k` because any subset containing numbers up to `k // 2` will not reach `k`, and any subset starting from `k + 1` onwards will exceed `k`.
   - **Distinct Numbers**: Each number in the list is unique and within the specified range.
   - **Subset Sum Condition**: Since the numbers from `1` to `k // 2` do not sum to `k` and the numbers from `k + 1` onwards cannot form a subset that sums to `k`, this strategy satisfies the problem's requirement.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description and ensures the chosen numbers meet the required conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
