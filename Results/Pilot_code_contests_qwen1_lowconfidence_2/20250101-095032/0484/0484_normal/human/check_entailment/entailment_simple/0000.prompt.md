You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two integers n and k. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to n so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to k.

A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).

Each of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the description of test cases.

Output

For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer m — the number of chosen integers.

In the second line output m distinct integers from 1 to n — the chosen numbers.

If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.

Example

Input


3
3 2
5 3
1 1


Output


2
3 1 
3
4 5 2 
0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        ans = [x for x in range(1, k // 2 + 1)] + [x for x in range(k + 1, n + 1)]
        
        print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, ans))))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ans` is a list of integers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n + 1`, the output is `n - k // 2 + 1` followed by the elements of `ans` joined into a single string separated by spaces.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
