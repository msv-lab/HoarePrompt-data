Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when `k` is equal to `n`. In such cases, the program incorrectly includes `k` in the chosen numbers, which would violate the condition that no subset of chosen numbers should sum to `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 5
```

The expected output should be:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

However, the current program outputs:
```
1
5
```

This is incorrect because including `5` violates the condition that no subset of chosen numbers should sum to `5`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
