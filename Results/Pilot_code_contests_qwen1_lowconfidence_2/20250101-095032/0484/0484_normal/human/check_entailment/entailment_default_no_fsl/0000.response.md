Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where \( k \) is greater than half of \( n \). In such cases, the approach of choosing numbers from 1 to \( k // 2 + 1 \) and from \( k + 1 \) to \( n \) might not guarantee that no subset of the chosen numbers sums to \( k \).

For example, consider the test case \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \):
- The code would generate the list `[1, 2, 5]`.
- However, the subset `[1, 3]` sums to 4, which violates the problem constraints.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
