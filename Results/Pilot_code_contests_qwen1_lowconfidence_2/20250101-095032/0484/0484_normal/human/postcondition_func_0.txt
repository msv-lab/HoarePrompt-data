The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000\). For each test case, it generates a list `ans` containing integers from 1 to `k // 2 + 1` followed by integers from `k + 1` to `n`. The function then prints the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` concatenated into a single line separated by spaces. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads the number of test cases `T` (where \(1 \leq T \leq 100\)) from standard input at the beginning. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases, printing the required output for each case.
