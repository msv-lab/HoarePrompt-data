The function `func_2()` does not accept any input parameters and instead uses the built-in `input()` function to prompt the user for an integer input. The function then returns this integer value, which represents the order of the rhombus. However, the function lacks any validation to ensure that the input is indeed an integer, leading to potential runtime errors if the user enters non-integer values. Additionally, the function does not handle any specific edge cases, such as very large or very small integer values, although the behavior for these cases would depend on the underlying system's limitations.
