The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100. It checks whether `x` is a power of 2. If `x` is not a power of 2, the function returns `False`. If `x` is a power of 2, the function returns `True`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is 1, which is a power of 2. The function also correctly handles the edge case where `x` is outside the specified range (though such cases should not arise given the constraints).
