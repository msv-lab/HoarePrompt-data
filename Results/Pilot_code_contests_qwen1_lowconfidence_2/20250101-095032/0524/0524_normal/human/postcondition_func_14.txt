The function `func_15` takes no explicit parameters and internally calls `func_1()` to get an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`. Based on the value of `n`, it either directly calls `func_16(1)` if `n` is 1, or it enters a loop to compute the values of `r` and `ans` according to the given formulas: `r = 2n - 2` and `ans = 2n^2 - 2n + 2`. After the loop, it calls `func_16(ans)`. The function ensures that if `n` is 1, the value passed to `func_16` is 1, and if `n > 1`, it computes and passes the value of `ans` which is derived from the loop computations.
