The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 100 and returns a list of its individual digits as integers. This is achieved by converting the integer `n` into a string, then iterating over each character in the string, converting it back to an integer, and collecting these integers into a list. Potential edge cases include the minimum value (1) and maximum value (100) of `n`. Since the function uses list comprehension to convert each digit from the string representation of `n` to an integer, it correctly handles all single-digit and multi-digit numbers within the specified range without any missing functionality.
