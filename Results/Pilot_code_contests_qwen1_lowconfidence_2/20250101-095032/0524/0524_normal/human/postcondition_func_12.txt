The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. The potential edge case is when `y` is initially 0; in this case, the function immediately returns `x` without entering the loop, assuming `x` is already the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will incorrectly return 0, which is a missing functionality since the GCD of 0 and 0 is undefined.
