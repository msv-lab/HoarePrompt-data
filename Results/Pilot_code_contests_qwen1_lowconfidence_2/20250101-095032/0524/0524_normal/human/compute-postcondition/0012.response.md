`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file `file`. Since the initial content of `file` is `next_x + sep` and the condition `not at_start` evaluates to true, `at_start` is `False`.

After executing the line of code, the content of the file `file` will have `next_x + sep` followed by the string representation of `x`. The variables `at_start`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged; the content of `file` is `next_x + sep + str(x)`**
