The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` affects the variables `sep` and `file`. Let's break down the code:

1. `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` tries to pop the value associated with the key 'sep' from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the key exists, its value is removed from `kwargs` and assigned to `sep`. If the key does not exist, `b' '` (a byte string) is assigned to `sep`.
2. `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` tries to pop the value associated with the key 'file' from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the key exists, its value is removed from `kwargs` and assigned to `file`. If the key does not exist, `sys.stdout` (the standard output stream) is assigned to `file`.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `kwargs`, `sys.stdout`, or any other variables, we assume the default behavior as described.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`**
