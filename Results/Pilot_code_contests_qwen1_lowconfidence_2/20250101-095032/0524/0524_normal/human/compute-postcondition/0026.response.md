Functionality: **The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number within the range 1 < n â‰¤ 100, and `False` otherwise. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returning `False`. If `n` is between 2 and 3, it returns `True`. It then checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if true. After these initial checks, it uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `i` and `i+2` up to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all these checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning `False`.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 2 or 3, returning `True`.
- The function correctly handles even numbers and multiples of 3, returning `False`.
- The function correctly checks divisibility by numbers of the form `i` and `i+2` up to the square root of `n`.

**Potential Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is exactly 100, although this case is implicitly covered by the condition `i * i <= n` in the loop.
