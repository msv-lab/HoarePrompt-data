The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. Since the initial state specifies that the content of `file` depends on the value of `at_start`, let's consider both cases:

1. If `at_start` is `False`, the content of `file` is `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg)) + sep`.
2. If `at_start` is `True`, the content of `file` is `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg))`.

In both cases, the code `file.write(str(x))` will append `str(x)` to the current content of `file`. However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new content of `file`. But we can express it in terms of the initial content plus `str(x)`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file` is the content `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg)) + sep` or `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg))` depending on the initial value of `at_start`; `file` now includes `str(x)` appended to its current content. `args` remain unchanged.**
