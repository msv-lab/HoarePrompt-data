Postcondition: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged; `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`; `file` now contains the content of `args` concatenated with `sep` and a newline character. If `flush` is `True`, the value of `flush` is popped from `kwargs`; otherwise, `kwargs` remains unchanged.**
