The initial state is that `at_start` is a boolean, and if `not at_start`, then `at_start` remains `False`. Otherwise, `at_start` is `True`. The values of `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged from their initial states. The file `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.

The code snippet sets `at_start` to `False`. This means that regardless of the initial value of `at_start`, it is now explicitly set to `False`. The values of `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged from their initial states, the file `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.**
