The code sets `at_start` to `False`. This directly changes the value of `at_start`. The other variables (`sep`, `file`, `args`, `next_x`, `next_arg`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file` is the content `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg)) + sep` or `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg))` depending on the initial value of `at_start`; `file` now includes `str(x)` appended to its current content. `args` remain unchanged.**
