`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `sep`, `file`, and `args`, nor does it change the content of `file`. The content of `file` remains as `next_x + sep + str(x)`. 

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged; the content of `file` is `next_x + sep + str(x)`**
