The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` does the following:

1. It pops the value associated with the key `'end'` from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the key does not exist, it defaults to `b'\n'`.
2. It writes this value to the file object `file`.

Since `kwargs` is not initially defined, and no default dictionary is provided, the `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` part will default to `b'\n'` because `'end'` is not in `kwargs`. Therefore, `file.write(b'\n')` will write `b'\n'` (a newline character) to the file.

The states of `at_start`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged. The only affected variable is `kwargs`, which now no longer contains the key `'end'` (assuming it did not originally contain this key).

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged; `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `file` now contains the content of `args` concatenated with `sep` and a newline character.**
