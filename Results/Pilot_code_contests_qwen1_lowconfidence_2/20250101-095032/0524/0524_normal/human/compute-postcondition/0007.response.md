The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file `file`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, so we cannot determine the exact content written to the file. The only thing we know is that `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is a boolean. If `not at_start`, then `at_start` remains `False`. Otherwise, `at_start` is `True`. The values of `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged from their initial states. The file `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.**
