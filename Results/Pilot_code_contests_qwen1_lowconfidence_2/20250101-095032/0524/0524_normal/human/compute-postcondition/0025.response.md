Functionality: **The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It takes no arguments and operates on positional arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. The function writes the string representation of each element in `args` to the file object specified by `file`, using `sep` as the separator between elements. After writing all elements, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the file, which defaults to a newline character. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output buffer. However, since the function does not define `args` or `kwargs`, these variables are not used within the function. Additionally, the function does not perform any action based on the presence of `args` or `kwargs`, meaning it essentially performs no operation when called without arguments.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes `sep` and `file` are provided via keyword arguments. If `sep` or `file` are not provided, the function will raise a `TypeError` because it tries to use `kwargs.pop` without ensuring these keys exist.
- The function does not handle the case where `args` or `kwargs` might be empty, which means it will not write anything to `file` if no arguments are provided.
- The function does not validate the types of `sep` or `file`, assuming `file` is a file-like object. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `file` is not a valid file object.
