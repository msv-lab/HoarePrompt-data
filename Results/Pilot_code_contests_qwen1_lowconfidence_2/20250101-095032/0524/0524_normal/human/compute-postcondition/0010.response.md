`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. Since `file` initially contained the string representation of `next_x`, after writing `sep`, the file will contain `next_x + sep`. The other variables (`at_start`, `sep`, `file`, and `args`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`; `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged; the content of the file `file` is `next_x + sep`**
