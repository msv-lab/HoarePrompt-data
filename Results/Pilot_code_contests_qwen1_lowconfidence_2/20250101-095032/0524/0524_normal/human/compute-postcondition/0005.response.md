The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Since no further operations modify the variables, the values of `at_start`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or `b' '`, `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `args` must contain at least one element**
