Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged. The content of `file` is either `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg)) + sep` if the condition `not at_start` is true, or remains as `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg))` if the condition is false.***
