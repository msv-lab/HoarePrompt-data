`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. The value of `sep` remains unchanged, and the content of `file` now includes an additional `sep` string at the end. The other variables (`at_start`, `args`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged; the content of `file` is `next_x + sep + str(next_x + sep + str(next_arg)) + sep`**
