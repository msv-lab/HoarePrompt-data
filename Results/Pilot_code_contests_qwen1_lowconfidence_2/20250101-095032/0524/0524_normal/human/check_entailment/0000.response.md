Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not actually compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Instead, it seems to be implementing a different algorithm, possibly related to a sequence or pattern, but it does not match the described problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` is called, but it does not implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in a rhombus as defined in the problem description.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should follow the recursive definition of the rhombus:

1. A 1st-order rhombus has 1 cell.
2. For n â‰¥ 2, an n-th order rhombus is formed by adding all cells that share a side with the (n-1)-th order rhombus.

The correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def count_cells_in_rhombus(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return count_cells_in_rhombus(n-1) + 4 * (n - 1)
```

This function correctly computes the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus by recursively adding 4 times the (n-1) value to the result for each level up to 1.
