Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus as defined in the problem description. Based on the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the functions `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the logic required to solve the problem. 

- `func_15` reads an integer `n` from the input, but instead of computing the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, it appears to be performing some other computation involving `r` and `ans`, which does not align with the problem requirements.
- `func_16` is a print function and does not contribute to solving the problem.

The code does not implement the recursive logic needed to compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The correct logic, as previously mentioned, should be:

```python
def count_cells_in_rhombus(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return count_cells_in_rhombus(n-1) + 4 * (n - 1)
```

Since the provided program does not implement this logic, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
