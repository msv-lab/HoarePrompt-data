You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 × 1 (i.e just a cell).

A n-th order rhombus for all n ≥ 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

<image>

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Input

The first and only input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not actually compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Instead, it seems to be implementing a different algorithm, possibly related to a sequence or pattern, but it does not match the described problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` is called, but it does not implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in a rhombus as defined in the problem description.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should follow the recursive definition of the rhombus:

1. A 1st-order rhombus has 1 cell.
2. For n ≥ 2, an n-th order rhombus is formed by adding all cells that share a side with the (n-1)-th order rhombus.

The correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def count_cells_in_rhombus(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return count_cells_in_rhombus(n-1) + 4 * (n - 1)
```

This function correctly computes the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus by recursively adding 4 times the (n-1) value to the result for each level up to 1.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
