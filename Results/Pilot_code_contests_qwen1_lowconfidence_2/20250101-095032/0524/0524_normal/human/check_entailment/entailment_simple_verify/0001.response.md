Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15()` attempts to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus, but its logic does not align with the expected pattern. Specifically, the loop and the way the final answer is derived do not correctly implement the incremental addition of cells around the perimeter of the rhombus.

For example, for a 3rd order rhombus, the expected number of cells is 13. However, the current implementation does not correctly account for the increasing number of cells added in each iteration. Instead of adding cells in a way that matches the problem description, the current logic leads to incorrect results. The annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly implement the calculation, hence maintaining the original assessment of **False**.
