Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Based on the problem description, each n-th order rhombus is formed by adding cells around the perimeter of the (n-1)-th order rhombus. The function `func_15()` attempts to calculate the number of cells but does not follow the correct incremental pattern.

From the output hints, we know that `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not perform any meaningful operations. This further confirms that the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
