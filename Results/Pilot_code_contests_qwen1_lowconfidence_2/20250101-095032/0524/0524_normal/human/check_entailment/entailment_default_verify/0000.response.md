Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_15` is called in the program, but it does not implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in a rhombus as defined in the problem description. Instead, `func_15` appears to be implementing a different algorithm, likely related to a sequence or pattern, but it does not match the described problem. The output hints further confirm that the function `func_16` does not perform any meaningful operation, as it simply prints elements with a separator and end character without any input parameters or logic relevant to the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus remains incorrect.
