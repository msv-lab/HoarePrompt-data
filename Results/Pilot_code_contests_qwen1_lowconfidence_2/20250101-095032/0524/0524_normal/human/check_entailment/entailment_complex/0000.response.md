Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_15` does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly according to the problem description. The problem description requires the program to compute the number of cells in an `n`-th order rhombus, and for `n=1`, the output should be 1. However, the code calls `func_16(1)` directly when `n` is 1, which means the final output will be the number of cells in a 1-st order rhombus plus some additional calculations from the subsequent loop.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issue:

1. **For `n=1`:**
   - The code correctly reads `n` from input.
   - When `n == 1`, it calls `func_16(1)`.
   - However, the problem description requires the output to be simply 1 for `n=1`, but the code seems to be performing additional computations before calling `func_16`.

2. **For `n > 1`:**
   - The code enters a loop and performs computations to calculate the number of cells in the `n`-th order rhombus.
   - Finally, it calls `func_16(ans)`, where `ans` is computed as `2n^2 - 2n + 2`.
   - This computation does not match the problem description, which suggests a different formula for the number of cells in an `n`-th order rhombus.

Given the problem description and the intended behavior, the code needs to be corrected to directly return `1` for `n=1` and compute the correct formula for `n > 1`.
