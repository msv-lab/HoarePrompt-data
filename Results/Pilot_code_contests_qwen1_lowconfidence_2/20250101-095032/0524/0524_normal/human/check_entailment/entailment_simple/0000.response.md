Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to compute the number of cells in an \(n\)-th order rhombus. According to the problem description, the number of cells in a \(n\)-th order rhombus can be derived from the formula \(4n^2 - 4n + 2\). Let's break down why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions listed in the annotated program are not directly related to calculating the number of cells in an \(n\)-th order rhombus. Some of them are general utility functions that don't contribute to solving the specific problem at hand.
   - The relevant part of the program is in `func_15()`, which is supposed to compute the number of cells in an \(n\)-th order rhombus.

2. **Logic in `func_15()`**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` is flawed. It attempts to use a loop to compute some intermediate values, but the final formula used (`2n^2 - 2n + 2`) does not match the correct formula \(4n^2 - 4n + 2\).

3. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula for the number of cells in an \(n\)-th order rhombus is \(4n^2 - 4n + 2\). This can be derived by observing the pattern in the number of cells for each \(n\):
     - For \(n = 1\): 1 cell
     - For \(n = 2\): 5 cells
     - For \(n = 3\): 13 cells
     - And so on...

4. **Implementation Issue**:
   - In `func_15()`, the loop iterates from 2 to \(n+1\), and inside the loop, it tries to calculate something using `r` and `m`, but these calculations do not lead to the correct formula.
   - The final value of `ans` is incorrectly computed as \(2n^2 - 2n + 2\), which is not the correct formula.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_15():
    n = int(input())  # Get the input n
    if n == 1:
        print(1)  # Base case for n = 1
    else:
        # Use the correct formula to compute the number of cells
        print(4 * n * n - 4 * n + 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_15()
```

This implementation correctly computes the number of cells in an \(n\)-th order rhombus using the formula \(4n^2 - 4n + 2\) and prints the result. Therefore, the original program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
