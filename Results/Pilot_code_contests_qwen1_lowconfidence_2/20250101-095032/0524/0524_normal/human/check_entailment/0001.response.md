Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Based on the problem description, a 1st order rhombus is a 1x1 square (1 cell), and each subsequent order adds cells around the perimeter of the previous rhombus.

For example:
- A 1st order rhombus has 1 cell.
- A 2nd order rhombus has 5 cells.
- A 3rd order rhombus has 13 cells.

However, the function `func_15()` attempts to calculate the number of cells using a different approach that does not match this pattern. Specifically, the logic inside the loop and the way the final answer is derived do not align with the expected formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.

To verify, let's consider the calculation for the 3rd order rhombus:
- A 1st order rhombus has 1 cell.
- To form a 2nd order rhombus, we add 4 cells around the 1st order rhombus, making it 5 cells.
- To form a 3rd order rhombus, we add 12 more cells (since each side grows by 2 cells, and there are 4 sides minus the 4 corners already counted once), making it 13 cells.

The provided code does not implement this incremental addition of cells correctly, leading to incorrect results for higher-order rhombuses. For instance, if we run the program with `n = 3`, the output will be incorrect.
