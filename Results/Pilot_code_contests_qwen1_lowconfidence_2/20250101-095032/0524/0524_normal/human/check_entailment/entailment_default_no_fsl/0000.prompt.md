You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 × 1 (i.e just a cell).

A n-th order rhombus for all n ≥ 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

<image>

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Input

The first and only input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` prompts the user to input an integer within the range of 1 to 100 and returns that integer. If the user inputs a value outside this range, the function will continue to prompt until a valid input is given.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` does not accept any input parameters and instead uses the built-in `input()` function to prompt the user for an integer input. The function then returns this integer value, which represents the order of the rhombus. However, the function lacks any validation to ensure that the input is indeed an integer, leading to potential runtime errors if the user enters non-integer values. Additionally, the function does not handle any specific edge cases, such as very large or very small integer values, although the behavior for these cases would depend on the underlying system's limitations.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a single integer `n` from standard input, expects `n` more integers separated by spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function assumes that exactly `n` integers are provided after reading `n`. If fewer or more integers are provided, the function will raise an error since the map object cannot be constructed properly. No validation is performed to ensure that the input meets the expected format.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. The function does not perform any operations other than returning the output of `func_3()`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code snippet.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts a new thread to run a function named `main`. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, a new thread is running the `main` function, and the original thread continues executing without waiting for the new thread to finish.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the first element is an integer representing the order of a rhombus (1 ≤ item[0] ≤ 100). The function returns this integer, which represents the order of the rhombus. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond returning the first element of the `item` tuple or list. The function handles the following cases:
1. If `item` is a valid tuple or list with at least one element and the first element is within the specified range (1 to 100), the function returns this integer.
2. If `item` is an empty tuple or list, or if the first element is outside the specified range, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle these cases.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a list of integers `l` and returns a new list of integers from `l` sorted based on the values returned by the `getKey` function for each element. The function performs the following actions:
1. It uses the `sorted` function to sort the elements of `l`.
2. The sorting key is determined by the `getKey` function, which is applied to each element of `l`.
3. The function does not modify the original list `l`; instead, it creates and returns a new sorted list.
4. If the `getKey` function is not defined or does not return valid sorting keys for all elements, the function may raise an error (e.g., `TypeError`).
5. The function handles the case where `l` is an empty list by returning an empty list.
6. The function does not handle cases where `l` contains non-integer values; if such values are present, the `getKey` function must handle them appropriately to avoid errors.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a matrix, and `num` is an integer value that fills each cell in the matrix. After executing the function, it returns a matrix (a list of lists) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the matrix is the integer `num`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The code correctly constructs and returns the desired matrix.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100. It checks whether `x` is a power of 2. If `x` is not a power of 2, the function returns `False`. If `x` is a power of 2, the function returns `True`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is 1, which is a power of 2. The function also correctly handles the edge case where `x` is outside the specified range (though such cases should not arise given the constraints).
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a single parameter `n`, which should be an integer. It converts `n` to its binary representation using the built-in `bin()` function, then removes the '0b' prefix from the resulting string and returns the modified string. The function correctly handles all valid integer inputs, including negative integers, zero, and positive integers. No edge cases or missing functionality exist based on the provided code.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 100 and returns a list of its individual digits as integers. This is achieved by converting the integer `n` into a string, then iterating over each character in the string, converting it back to an integer, and collecting these integers into a list. Potential edge cases include the minimum value (1) and maximum value (100) of `n`. Since the function uses list comprehension to convert each digit from the string representation of `n` to an integer, it correctly handles all single-digit and multi-digit numbers within the specified range without any missing functionality.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p1
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers and `p` is a positive integer representing a prime number. It computes the result of the modular exponentiation \(x^y \mod p\) using an efficient algorithm known as "Exponentiation by Squaring." Specifically, it iteratively squares `x` and multiplies it into the result when `y` is odd, reducing `y` by half each iteration until `y` becomes zero. After the loop, the function returns the computed result. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `y` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the function immediately returns 1 since \(x^0 \equiv 1 \mod p\).
- If `x` is 0, the result will always be 0 regardless of `y` and `p`, as \(0^y \equiv 0 \mod p\).

The function correctly implements the modular exponentiation algorithm as described in the annotations and return postconditions.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. The potential edge case is when `y` is initially 0; in this case, the function immediately returns `x` without entering the loop, assuming `x` is already the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will incorrectly return 0, which is a missing functionality since the GCD of 0 and 0 is undefined.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning `False`.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 2 or 3, returning `True`.
- The function correctly handles even numbers and multiples of 3, returning `False`.
- The function correctly checks divisibility by numbers of the form `i` and `i+2` up to the square root of `n`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    n = func_1()
    if n == 1:
        func_16(1)
    else:
        r = 1
        ans = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            m = r * r % ans
            r += 2
            ans += 4 + m
        func_16(ans)
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` takes no explicit parameters and internally calls `func_1()` to get an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`. Based on the value of `n`, it either directly calls `func_16(1)` if `n` is 1, or it enters a loop to compute the values of `r` and `ans` according to the given formulas: `r = 2n - 2` and `ans = 2n^2 - 2n + 2`. After the loop, it calls `func_16(ans)`. The function ensures that if `n` is 1, the value passed to `func_16` is 1, and if `n > 1`, it computes and passes the value of `ans` which is derived from the loop computations.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It takes no arguments and operates on positional arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. The function writes the string representation of each element in `args` to the file object specified by `file`, using `sep` as the separator between elements. After writing all elements, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the file, which defaults to a newline character. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output buffer. However, since the function does not define `args` or `kwargs`, these variables are not used within the function. Additionally, the function does not perform any action based on the presence of `args` or `kwargs`, meaning it essentially performs no operation when called without arguments.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
