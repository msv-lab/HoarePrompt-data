Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_15` does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. According to the problem description, the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus can be calculated using the formula \(2n^2 - 2n + 1\). However, the code in `func_15` uses a different approach that does not consistently produce the correct result for all values of \(n\).

For example:
- When \(n = 1\), the correct answer is 1, and the code correctly outputs 1.
- When \(n = 2\), the correct answer is 5, but the code computes an incorrect value.
- When \(n = 3\), the correct answer is 13, but the code again computes an incorrect value.

The code in `func_15` seems to be attempting to compute the number of cells by iterating and adding cells, but the logic is flawed and does not produce the correct result for \(n > 1\). Therefore, the program is incorrect for the majority of potential cases.
