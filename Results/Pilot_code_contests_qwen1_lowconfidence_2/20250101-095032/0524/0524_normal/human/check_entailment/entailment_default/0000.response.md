Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The logic in `func_15` attempts to calculate the number of cells, but it uses an incorrect formula. Specifically, the formula used is:

\[ \text{ans} = 2n^2 - 2n + 2 \]

This formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is:

\[ \text{cells} = n^2 + (n-1)^2 \]

To verify this, let's consider a few cases:

1. For \( n = 1 \):
   - Correct answer: \( 1^2 + (1-1)^2 = 1 \)
   - Program answer: \( 2(1)^2 - 2(1) + 2 = 2 \)
   
2. For \( n = 2 \):
   - Correct answer: \( 2^2 + (2-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \)
   - Program answer: \( 2(2)^2 - 2(2) + 2 = 8 - 4 + 2 = 6 \)
   
3. For \( n = 3 \):
   - Correct answer: \( 3^2 + (3-1)^2 = 9 + 4 = 13 \)
   - Program answer: \( 2(3)^2 - 2(3) + 2 = 18 - 6 + 2 = 14 \)

These examples show that the program does not produce the correct number of cells for an n-th order rhombus. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
