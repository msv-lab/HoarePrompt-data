Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The provided code uses a different approach that does not align with the expected pattern. Specifically, the loop inside `func_15()` calculates values of `r` and `ans` using formulas that do not correspond to the incremental addition of cells required to form an n-th order rhombus.

For example, the calculation for the number of cells in a 2nd order rhombus should be 5, and for a 3rd order rhombus, it should be 13. However, the current implementation does not produce these correct results. The annotated version confirms that the function does not correctly follow the incremental pattern of adding cells to form higher-order rhombuses.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is still valid.
