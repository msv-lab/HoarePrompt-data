Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the goal is to compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The provided code does not implement this functionality. Instead, it contains various utility functions that do not address the core problem. The function `func_15` attempts to compute something, but it does not follow the recursive definition of the rhombus as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it calculates values using a formula that does not match the described growth pattern of the rhombus. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in concluding that the program does not meet the problem description.
