#State of the program right berfore the function call: The variable n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user that is within the range of 1 to 100
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user to input an integer within the range of 1 to 100 and returns that integer. If the user inputs a value outside this range, the function will continue to prompt until a valid input is given.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no input variable in the provided function, but the problem expects an input integer n representing the order of the rhombus.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input integer n representing the order of the rhombus
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` does not accept any input parameters and instead uses the built-in `input()` function to prompt the user for an integer input. The function then returns this integer value, which represents the order of the rhombus. However, the function lacks any validation to ensure that the input is indeed an integer, leading to potential runtime errors if the user enters non-integer values. Additionally, the function does not handle any specific edge cases, such as very large or very small integer values, although the behavior for these cases would depend on the underlying system's limitations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no input parameter for the function. The input is read from standard input and consists of a single line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers read from standard input, split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a single integer `n` from standard input, expects `n` more integers separated by spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function assumes that exactly `n` integers are provided after reading `n`. If fewer or more integers are provided, the function will raise an error since the map object cannot be constructed properly. No validation is performed to ensure that the input meets the expected format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided. However, based on the problem description and the nature of the function, we can infer that this function does not take any input parameters since the problem description specifies that the input is read from stdin and not passed as arguments to a function.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. The function does not perform any operations other than returning the output of `func_3()`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code snippet.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no variable related to the problem description in the function signature. The function does not take any input parameters related to computing the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts a new thread to run a function named `main`. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, a new thread is running the `main` function, and the original thread continues executing without waiting for the new thread to finish.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the first element is an integer representing the order of the rhombus (1 ≤ item[0] ≤ 100).
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the integer representing the order of the rhombus, which is the first element of the tuple or list `item`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the first element is an integer representing the order of a rhombus (1 ≤ item[0] ≤ 100). The function returns this integer, which represents the order of the rhombus. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond returning the first element of the `item` tuple or list. The function handles the following cases:
1. If `item` is a valid tuple or list with at least one element and the first element is within the specified range (1 to 100), the function returns this integer.
2. If `item` is an empty tuple or list, or if the first element is outside the specified range, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle these cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a list of integers from 'l' sorted based on the values returned by the 'getKey' function for each element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list of integers `l` and returns a new list of integers from `l` sorted based on the values returned by the `getKey` function for each element. The function performs the following actions:
1. It uses the `sorted` function to sort the elements of `l`.
2. The sorting key is determined by the `getKey` function, which is applied to each element of `l`.
3. The function does not modify the original list `l`; instead, it creates and returns a new sorted list.
4. If the `getKey` function is not defined or does not return valid sorting keys for all elements, the function may raise an error (e.g., `TypeError`).
5. The function handles the case where `l` is an empty list by returning an empty list.
6. The function does not handle cases where `l` contains non-integer values; if such values are present, the `getKey` function must handle them appropriately to avoid errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of a matrix, and num is an integer value that will fill each cell in the matrix.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a matrix (a list of lists) with 'n' rows and 'm' columns, where each element in the matrix is the integer 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a matrix, and `num` is an integer value that fills each cell in the matrix. After executing the function, it returns a matrix (a list of lists) with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the matrix is the integer `num`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The code correctly constructs and returns the desired matrix.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100.
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns False if x is not a power of 2, and True if x is a power of 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100. It checks whether `x` is a power of 2. If `x` is not a power of 2, the function returns `False`. If `x` is a power of 2, the function returns `True`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is 1, which is a power of 2. The function also correctly handles the edge case where `x` is outside the specified range (though such cases should not arise given the constraints).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a single parameter `n`, which should be an integer. It converts `n` to its binary representation using the built-in `bin()` function, then removes the '0b' prefix from the resulting string and returns the modified string. The function correctly handles all valid integer inputs, including negative integers, zero, and positive integers. No edge cases or missing functionality exist based on the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the original integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 100 and returns a list of its individual digits as integers. This is achieved by converting the integer `n` into a string, then iterating over each character in the string, converting it back to an integer, and collecting these integers into a list. Potential edge cases include the minimum value (1) and maximum value (100) of `n`. Since the function uses list comprehension to convert each digit from the string representation of `n` to an integer, it correctly handles all single-digit and multi-digit numbers within the specified range without any missing functionality.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, p is a positive integer representing a prime number.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is \(((x \% p)^{2^k}) \% p1\), where \(k\) is the number of times the loop executed, `y` is 0, `res` is the result of applying the modular exponentiation algorithm described by the loop to the initial values of `x` and `p`
    return res
    #The program returns the result of applying the modular exponentiation algorithm described by the loop to the initial values of x and p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers and `p` is a positive integer representing a prime number. It computes the result of the modular exponentiation \(x^y \mod p\) using an efficient algorithm known as "Exponentiation by Squaring." Specifically, it iteratively squares `x` and multiplies it into the result when `y` is odd, reducing `y` by half each iteration until `y` becomes zero. After the loop, the function returns the computed result. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `y` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the function immediately returns 1 since \(x^0 \equiv 1 \mod p\).
- If `x` is 0, the result will always be 0 regardless of `y` and `p`, as \(0^y \equiv 0 \mod p\).

The function correctly implements the modular exponentiation algorithm as described in the annotations and return postconditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'x' and 'y'; 'y' is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, given that y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. The potential edge case is when `y` is initially 0; in this case, the function immediately returns `x` without entering the loop, assuming `x` is already the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will incorrectly return 0, which is a missing functionality since the GCD of 0 and 0 is undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_14(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 < n <= 100
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 100, and n is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 100, and n is greater than 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and n is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 < n \leq 100 \), \( n > 3 \), \( n \) is not divisible by 2, and \( n \) is not divisible by 3, and \( n \) is not divisible by any integer \( i \) or \( i + 2 \) where \( i \) is an integer such that \( i^2 \leq n \); \( i \) is the smallest integer greater than \( \sqrt{n} \) such that \( (i-6)^2 \leq n \).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning `False`.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 2 or 3, returning `True`.
- The function correctly handles even numbers and multiples of 3, returning `False`.
- The function correctly checks divisibility by numbers of the form `i` and `i+2` up to the square root of `n`.

            r += 2
            
            ans += 4 + m
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` ≠ 1, `i` is `n` + 1, `r` is `2n - 2`, `ans` is `2n^2 - 2n + 2`, `m` is undefined.
        func_16(ans)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `n` is set to the return value of `func_1()`. If `n` is 1, then `func_16(1)` has been called. Otherwise, `i` is `n` + 1, `r` is `2n - 2`, `ans` is `2n^2 - 2n + 2`, and `m` is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes no explicit parameters and internally calls `func_1()` to get an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`. Based on the value of `n`, it either directly calls `func_16(1)` if `n` is 1, or it enters a loop to compute the values of `r` and `ans` according to the given formulas: `r = 2n - 2` and `ans = 2n^2 - 2n + 2`. After the loop, it calls `func_16(ans)`. The function ensures that if `n` is 1, the value passed to `func_16` is 1, and if `n > 1`, it computes and passes the value of `ans` which is derived from the loop computations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are no relevant variables in the function signature related to the problem description. The function `func_16` does not contribute to solving the problem of computing the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged from their initial states, the content of `file` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged; `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`; `file` now contains the content of `args` concatenated with `sep` and a newline character. If `flush` is `True`, the value of `flush` is popped from `kwargs`; otherwise, `kwargs` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It takes no arguments and operates on positional arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. The function writes the string representation of each element in `args` to the file object specified by `file`, using `sep` as the separator between elements. After writing all elements, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to the file, which defaults to a newline character. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output buffer. However, since the function does not define `args` or `kwargs`, these variables are not used within the function. Additionally, the function does not perform any action based on the presence of `args` or `kwargs`, meaning it essentially performs no operation when called without arguments.
