The function reads a single integer `n` from standard input, expects `n` more integers separated by spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function assumes that exactly `n` integers are provided after reading `n`. If fewer or more integers are provided, the function will raise an error since the map object cannot be constructed properly. No validation is performed to ensure that the input meets the expected format.
