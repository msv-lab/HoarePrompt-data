The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the first element is an integer representing the order of a rhombus (1 ≤ item[0] ≤ 100). The function returns this integer, which represents the order of the rhombus. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond returning the first element of the `item` tuple or list. The function handles the following cases:
1. If `item` is a valid tuple or list with at least one element and the first element is within the specified range (1 to 100), the function returns this integer.
2. If `item` is an empty tuple or list, or if the first element is outside the specified range, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle these cases.
