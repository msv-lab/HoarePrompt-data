The function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, then starts a new thread to run a function named `main`. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, a new thread is running the `main` function, and the original thread continues executing without waiting for the new thread to finish.
