Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where there are no attacked cities (`m == 0`). According to the problem description, if there are no attacked cities, Super M should still be able to teleport to any city to start her journey. However, the code fails to initialize the necessary variables and logic when `m == 0`, leading to incorrect behavior. Specifically, the `func_2` and `func_3` functions assume that there are attacked cities, and they do not handle the case where `m` is zero. This omission means that the code will produce incorrect results when no cities are being attacked. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
