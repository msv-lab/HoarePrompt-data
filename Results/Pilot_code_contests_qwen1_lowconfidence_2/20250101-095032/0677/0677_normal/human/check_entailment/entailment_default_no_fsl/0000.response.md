Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the `numbers_of_attacked_cities` list is empty. Specifically, the following functions and parts of the code assume that `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is not empty:

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   ```python
   for i in numbers_of_attacked_cities:
       attacked_city[i] = True
   ```
   If `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is empty, this loop will never execute, leading to undefined behavior for `attacked_city`.

2. **Function `func_5`:**
   ```python
   func_4(numbers_of_attacked_cities[0])
   ```
   If `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is empty, accessing `numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]` will raise an `IndexError`.

3. **Function `func_2` and `func_5`:**
   Both functions rely on `numbers_of_attacked_cities` being non-empty to initialize certain states and perform necessary calculations. If it is empty, these functions will fail to initialize properly.

To fix this, the code should check if `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is empty at the beginning and handle this case appropriately. For example:

```python
if not numbers_of_attacked_cities:
    # Handle the case where there are no attacked cities
    # For example, print an error message or return a specific value
    print("No attacked cities provided")
    exit()
```

This check should be added at the start of `func_2`, `func_5`, and any other relevant functions to ensure the code works correctly for every potential case.
