Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where no cities are attacked (`m == 0`). When `m == 0`, the `visited` list might not be modified, and the `stack` and `pi` would remain empty. This could lead to unexpected behavior if these variables are later accessed without proper initialization. Additionally, the function `func_5` does not handle cases where the `numbers_of_attacked_cities` list is empty, which could lead to an error if `numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]` is accessed without checking its length.

To ensure the program works correctly in every potential case, additional checks should be added to handle scenarios where no cities are attacked or when the `numbers_of_attacked_cities` list is empty.
