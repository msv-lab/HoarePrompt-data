The function `func_1()` reads a space-separated string of integers from standard input (stdin), converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters accepted by the function. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in the map object containing fewer elements than expected or raising a `ValueError`. The function does not handle these cases internally; it simply returns the map object as is.
