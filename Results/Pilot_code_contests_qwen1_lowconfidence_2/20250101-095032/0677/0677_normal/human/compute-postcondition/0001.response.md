The code `distance[s] = 0` sets the distance of the starting city `s` to 0 in the `distance` list. The values of `n`, `s`, and `adjacents_list` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0.**
