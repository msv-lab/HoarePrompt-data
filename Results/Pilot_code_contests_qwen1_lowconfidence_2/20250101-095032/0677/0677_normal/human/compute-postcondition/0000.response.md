The code initializes a list `distance` where each element is set to -1. This means that for each city `i` (where `0 <= i < n`), `distance[i]` is now -1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `adjacents_list` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1.**
