`v` is assigned the value of `q.popleft()`, which removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `q`. The value of `v` is now the first city in the deque `q`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is the shortest distance from the starting city `s`, `q` is a deque object with the first city removed, `v` is the first city in the deque `q`.**
