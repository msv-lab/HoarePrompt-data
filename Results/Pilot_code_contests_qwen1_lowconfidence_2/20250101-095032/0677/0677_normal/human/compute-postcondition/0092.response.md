`distances1[u]` is assigned the value of `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`. Given the initial state where `visited[u]` is `True` and `determinate` is `True`, these values remain unchanged. The stack still contains `u`.

The only updated variable is `distances1[u]`, which now holds the maximum value between `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; stack contains `u`; `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`**
