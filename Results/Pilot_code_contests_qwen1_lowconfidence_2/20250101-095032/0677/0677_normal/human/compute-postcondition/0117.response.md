Postcondition: ***`u` is an unvisited adjacent vertex of `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `determinate` is `True` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `determinate` is `False`. In both cases, `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, and `distances2[u]` is updated to either `max(max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1, heights2[u])` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`. `stack` contains `u` and `u`.***
