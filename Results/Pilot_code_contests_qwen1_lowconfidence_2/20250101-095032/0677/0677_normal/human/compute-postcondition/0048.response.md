The code updates the value of `distance[u]` to `distance[v] + 1`. According to the initial state, `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, and now it is updated to `distance[v] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a queue with its leftmost element being an unprocessed city from `adjacents_list[v]`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one city, and that city must be in `q`, `distance[u]` is now `distance[v] + 1`, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.

Output State: **`q` is a queue with its leftmost element being an unprocessed city from `adjacents_list[v]`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one city, and that city must be in `q`, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.**
