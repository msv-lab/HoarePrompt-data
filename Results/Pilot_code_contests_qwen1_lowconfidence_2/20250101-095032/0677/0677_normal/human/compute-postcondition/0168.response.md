Postcondition: ***`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being `u`. `distances1[u]` is the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. `distances2[u]` remains unchanged in both cases, being either the maximum of its previous value and `distances2[v] + 1` or `heights1[u]`.***
