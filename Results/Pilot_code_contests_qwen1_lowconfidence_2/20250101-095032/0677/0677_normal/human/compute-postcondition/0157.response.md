Postcondition: ***`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is true, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is either `max(distances1[v] + 1, heights1[v] + 1)` or `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is either `max(heights1[v] + 2, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`.***
