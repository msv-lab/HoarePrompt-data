Postcondition: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `n` is the number of cities in Byteforces, `m` is the number of cities being attacked, `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is a list of `m` distinct integers representing the city numbers being attacked, `pi[u]` is updated to `v`, `visited` is a list of boolean values `[False, False, ..., False]` (with `n` elements) where the value at index `u` is now `True`, `heights1` and `heights2` are lists of integers representing the height of the tree formed by the attacked cities, `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `distances1[u]` remains unchanged, `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` if `distances1[u] == heights1[u]` and `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, or to `heights1[u]` otherwise, `visited[numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]]` is `True`, `stack` has `u` appended as its second-to-last element, and `determinate` is `True` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `determinate` remains `False`.**
