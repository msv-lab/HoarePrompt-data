`q` is appended with the value of `u`. The length of `q` increases by 1. The values of `adjacents_list[v]` and `distance[u]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is not empty with `u` added, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`q` is not empty with `u` added, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`**
