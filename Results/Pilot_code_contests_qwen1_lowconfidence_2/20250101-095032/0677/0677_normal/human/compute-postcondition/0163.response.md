The code `stack.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the stack. The stack was already non-empty with its top element being an adjacent city of `v` and `u` appended to it. This means the top element of the stack before this operation was the adjacent city of `v`, and now `u` is added as the new top element.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being `u`, `distances1[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic, `distances2[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic**
