`distance[u]` is assigned the value `distance[v] + 1`. The initial state specifies that `distance[u]` equals -1, so after this line of code, `distance[u]` will be updated to `distance[v] + 1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is not empty (with `u` added), `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`.**
