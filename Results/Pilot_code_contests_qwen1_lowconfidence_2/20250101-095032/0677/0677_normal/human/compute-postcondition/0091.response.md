`determinate` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `pi[u]`, `visited[u]`, and the contents of the `stack` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; stack contains `u`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; stack contains `u`**
