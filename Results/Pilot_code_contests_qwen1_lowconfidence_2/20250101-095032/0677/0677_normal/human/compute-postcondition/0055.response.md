Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is the starting city index. It initializes a `distance` list where each element initially is set to -1, except for the starting city `s`, which is set to 0. It then uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph represented by `adjacents_list`. During the traversal, it updates the `distance` list to contain the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city. After the BFS completes, the function returns the `distance` list. This list contains the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city. If a city is unreachable from `s`, its corresponding distance in the list will remain -1. The function handles all cities in the graph and ensures that the shortest path is found for each reachable city. Edge cases include when the graph is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), or when the starting city `s` is out of bounds (i.e., `s` is not between 0 and `n-1`). In such cases, the `distance` list will still be returned, but some or all elements may be -1 depending on the connectivity of the graph.**
