The function `func_5` accepts the following parameters:

- `n`: an integer representing the number of cities in Byteforces.
- `m`: an integer representing the number of cities being attacked.
- `numbers_of_attacked_cities`: a list of `m` distinct integers representing the city numbers being attacked.
- `adjacents_list`: a list of adjacency lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities adjacent to city `i`.
- `pi`: a list of integers representing the parent of each city in the DFS tree.
- `visited`: a list of boolean values indicating whether a city has been visited or not.
- `heights1`: a list of integers representing the height of the tree formed by the attacked cities in the first scenario.
- `heights2`: a list of integers representing the height of the tree formed by the attacked cities in the second scenario.
- `distances1`: a list of integers representing the distance from the root city to each city in the first scenario.
- `distances2`: a list of integers representing the distance from the root city to each city in the second scenario.

The function does not have a specified return value in the given information, so it likely performs some operations or computations based on these parameters without returning anything explicitly.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, `adjacents_list`, `pi`, `visited`, `heights1`, `heights2`, `distances1`, and `distances2`.**
