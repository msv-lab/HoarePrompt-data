Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, `distance[u]` is updated to `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was previously `-1`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except for `distance[u]` which is now `distance[v] + 1`, `q` is a deque object containing the elements `[original_u, u]` if `distance[u]` was `-1`, and `v` and `u` are the first cities in `adjacents_list[v]` and `adjacents_list[v]` respectively.***
