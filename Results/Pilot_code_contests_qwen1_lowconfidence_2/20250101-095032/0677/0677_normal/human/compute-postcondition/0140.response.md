The code snippet assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Based on the initial state:

- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.
- `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`.
- `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`.
- `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`.
- `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element.
- `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- `distances2[u]` is assigned the value of `heights1[u]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element, `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.**
