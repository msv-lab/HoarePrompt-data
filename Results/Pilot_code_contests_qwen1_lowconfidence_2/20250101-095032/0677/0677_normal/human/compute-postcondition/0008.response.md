The code assigns the value of `distance[v] + 1` to `distance[u]`. Given that `v` is the current starting city and `distance[v]` is 0, the value of `distance[u]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is an empty deque object, `v` is `s`, `adjacents_list[v]` is not an empty list; `distance[u]` is now 1 and `u` is a city adjacent to `v`.**
