`v` is assigned the value of the leftmost element in the queue `q` using the `popleft()` method, which removes and returns that element. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is now a queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities adjacent to `v`, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city, and `v` is the new last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`).
