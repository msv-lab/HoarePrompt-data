Given the initial state:
- `u` is an unvisited adjacent vertex of `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `determinate` is `False`
- `stack` contains `u` and `u`

The code snippet is:
```python
distances1[u] = distances1[v] + 1
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code:

1. **Impact on `distances1[u]`:**
   - The code updates `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`.
   - Since `distances1[v]` is not specified in the initial state, let's denote it as `d_v`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `visited[u]` remains `True` (unchanged).
   - `pi[u]` remains `v` (unchanged).
   - `determinate` remains `False` (unchanged).
   - The `stack` remains unchanged (`u` and `u`).

Thus, the new state after executing the code is:
- `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.
- All other variables remain as initially stated.

Output State: **`u` is an unvisited adjacent vertex of `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, stack contains `u` and `u`.**
