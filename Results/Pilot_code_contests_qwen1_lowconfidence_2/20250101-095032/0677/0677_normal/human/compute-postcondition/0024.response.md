`distance[u]` is assigned the value of `distance[v] + 1`. The value of `distance[v]` is -1, so the new value of `distance[u]` will be -1 + 1, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is not empty, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is 0**
