The code `visited[u] = True` sets the variable `visited[u]` to `True`. This changes the value of `visited[u]` from its previous value, which was `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic, `distances2[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic**
