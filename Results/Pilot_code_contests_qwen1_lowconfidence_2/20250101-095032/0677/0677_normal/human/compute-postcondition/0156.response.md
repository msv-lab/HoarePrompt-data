The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` updates the value of `distances2[u]` to be equal to `heights1[u]`. This overrides the previous value of `distances2[u]`, which was either `max(heights1[v] + 2, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is true, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
