The code `stack.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the stack. This operation does not affect the values of `pi[u]`, `visited[u]`, or `determinate`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `False`; stack contains `u`**
