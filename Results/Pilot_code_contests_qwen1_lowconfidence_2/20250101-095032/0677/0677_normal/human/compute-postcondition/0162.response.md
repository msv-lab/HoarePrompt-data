The code sets `determinate` to `False`. This directly updates the value of `determinate` without affecting any other variables. The other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic, `distances2[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic**
