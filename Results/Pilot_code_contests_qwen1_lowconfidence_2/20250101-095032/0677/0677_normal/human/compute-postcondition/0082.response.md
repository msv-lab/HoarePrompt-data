`distances1[u]` is assigned the value `distances1[v] + 1`. Given that `distances1[v]` represents the distance from `v` to some node in the graph, adding 1 to it means the distance from `u` to the same node is one step further. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`**
