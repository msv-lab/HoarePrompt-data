The code sets `determinate` to `True`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `determinate` and retains the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`determinate` is `True`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `disteterminate` is `False`, stack contains `u` and `u`, `distances1[u]` is either `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or remains as the previous value depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not.**
