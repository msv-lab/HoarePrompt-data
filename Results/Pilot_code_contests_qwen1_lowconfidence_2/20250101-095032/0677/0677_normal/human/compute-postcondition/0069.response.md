The code `stack.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the stack. This does not change the values of `adjacents_list[v]`, `pi[u]`, `visited[u]`, or `determinate`. The only variable that is affected is `stack`, which now contains `u`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` contains `u`**
