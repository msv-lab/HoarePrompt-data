The code sets `visited[u]` to `True`. Since `u` is within the DFS tree starting from `v`, this changes the state of `visited[u]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` (including the updated state of `u`), `determinate` is `True` or `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty (but does not contain the top element which was popped), `distances1[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario, and `distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario.**
