The code snippet `q.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `q`. The initial state mentions that `q` is not empty with `u` added, which means `u` is already present in `q`. After appending `u` again, `u` will be present twice in the list `q`.

Output State: **`q` is not empty with `u` added twice, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`**
