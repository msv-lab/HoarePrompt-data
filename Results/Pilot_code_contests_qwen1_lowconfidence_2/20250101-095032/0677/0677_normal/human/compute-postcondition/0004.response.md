To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the state before the loop.

### Analysis:

1. **`len(q) > 0`**: The condition for the loop to continue is that the queue `q` must contain at least one city. Since `q` is initially populated with the starting city `s`, we need to ensure that the queue has at least one city in it for the loop to proceed.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of cities.
   - `s` is an integer representing the starting city.
   - `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains the cities adjacent to city `i`.
   - `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except for `distance[s]` which is `0`.
   - `q` is a deque object containing `[s]`.

Given this information, the queue `q` is already initialized with the starting city `s`. Therefore, `len(q)` is `1`, which satisfies the condition `len(q) > 0`.

Since the queue `q` already contains at least one city (`s`), no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:

No adjustments are required to the given states for the loop to proceed. The queue `q` is already initialized correctly.

**State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is a deque object containing `[s]`.**
