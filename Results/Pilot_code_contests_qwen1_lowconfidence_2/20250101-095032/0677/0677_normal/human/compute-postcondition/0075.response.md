The code updates `distances2[u]` to the maximum value between `distances2[v] + 1` and `heights2[u]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `distances2[u]` is initially equal to `distances2[v] + 1` (since `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 1` and `distances1[u]` is equal to `distances2[v]`)
- `distances2[v] + 1` is already the value of `distances2[u]`
- `heights2[u]` is some value that could be less than, equal to, or greater than `distances2[v] + 1`

If `heights2[u]` is less than or equal to `distances2[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` remains unchanged. If `heights2[u]` is greater than `distances2[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` will be updated to `heights2[u]`.

Given that `distances2[u]` is initially equal to `distances2[v] + 1`, the only way `distances2[u]` would change is if `heights2[u]` is greater than `distances2[v] + 1`. Since the initial value of `distances2[u]` is `distances2[v] + 1`, the only way `distances2[u]` can change is if `heights2[u]` is greater than this value.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 1`, `heights1[u] + 1` is equal to `distances1[u]` and greater than `distances2[v]`, `distances2[u]` is equal to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` if `heights2[u] > distances2[v] + 1`, otherwise `distances2[u]` remains `distances2[v] + 1**
