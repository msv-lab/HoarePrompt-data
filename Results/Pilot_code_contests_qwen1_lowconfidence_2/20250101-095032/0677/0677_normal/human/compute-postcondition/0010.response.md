Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is a deque object; `v` is either `s` or `u`; `adjacents_list[v]` is not an empty list; if `distance[u]` is set to 1, it means `u` has been visited and its distance from the starting city `s` is 1.***
