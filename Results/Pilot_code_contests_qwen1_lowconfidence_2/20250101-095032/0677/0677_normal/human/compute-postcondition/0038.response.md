To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the situation step by step.

1. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `q` is a queue without its leftmost element.
   - `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities.
   - `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.
   - `v` is the new last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`).

2. **Condition for the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `adjacents_list[v]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one city, as this is the only condition that determines whether the loop will execute or not.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `q` is a queue without its leftmost element.
- `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city.
- `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.
- `v` is the new last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`).

**State:**
- `q` is a queue without its leftmost element,
- `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city,
- `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city,
- `v` is the new last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`).
