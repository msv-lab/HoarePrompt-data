Postcondition: ***`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element, `distances1[u]` is the maximum of `distances1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario, and the height of `u` plus one is equal to the value of `distances1[u]`.***
