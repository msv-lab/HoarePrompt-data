Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q` is not empty (with `u` added).
   - `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.
   - If `distance[u]` equals -1, then `distance[u]` is set to 0.
   - No other changes in the state of the program.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.

3. **Current State**:
   - Since `q` is not empty (with `u` added), it means `u` was added to `q` during the previous iteration.
   - `adjacents_list[v]` still contains at least one element, meaning there are still elements to iterate over.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `u` must be the next element in `adjacents_list[v]`.
   - The state of `q` and `adjacents_list[v]` should remain consistent for the next iteration, as no other changes are mentioned in the given information.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `q` remains non-empty (with `u` added).
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must still contain at least one element.
   - `distance[u]` might be set to 0 if it was -1, but since we are considering the start of the next iteration, we don't know the exact value of `distance[u]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q` is not empty (with `u` added), `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element. If `distance[u]` equals -1, then `distance[u]` is set to 0.**
