The code snippet `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `determinate` is `True`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `disteterminate` is `False`
- `stack` contains `u` and `u`
- `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`
- `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or remains as the previous value depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `distances2[u]` will be updated to `heights1[u]`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `determinate` is `True`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `disteterminate` is `False`
- `stack` contains `u` and `u`
- `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`
- `distances2[u]` is now `heights1[u]`

Output State: **`determinate` is `True`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `disteterminate` is `False`, stack contains `u` and `u`, `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1), `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
