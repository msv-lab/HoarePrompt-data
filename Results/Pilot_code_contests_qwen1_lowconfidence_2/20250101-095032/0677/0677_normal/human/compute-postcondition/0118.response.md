Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is empty, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `True` or `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is empty, `distances1[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario, and `distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to visit all adjacent cities of `v` that haven't been visited yet until there are no more such cities, making `adjacents_list[v]` empty.
- For each city `u` that is visited, `pi[u]` is set to `v`, and `visited[u]` is marked as `True`.
- The `determinate` flag helps decide how to update `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` based on certain conditions involving `heights1` and `heights2`.
- Once all adjacent cities of `v` are visited, the `stack` becomes empty since all cities in the DFS order are processed.
- After processing all cities, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` will be correctly updated according to the logic within the loop.
