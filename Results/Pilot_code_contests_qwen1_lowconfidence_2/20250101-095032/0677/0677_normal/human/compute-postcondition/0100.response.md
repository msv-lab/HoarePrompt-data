Postcondition: ***`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; stack contains `u`; `distances1[u]` is either `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or remains as the previous value depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not.***
