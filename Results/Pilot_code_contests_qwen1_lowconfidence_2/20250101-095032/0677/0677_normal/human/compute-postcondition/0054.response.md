The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer representing the starting city. The function also takes two additional parameters, `n` (the number of cities) and `adjacents_list` (a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`), although these are not explicitly shown in the function signature.

The output of the function is a list 'distance' which contains the shortest distance from the starting city 's' to each city.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `s` representing the starting city and return a list 'distance' containing the shortest distances from the starting city to all other cities based on the adjacency list provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, returns a list 'distance' containing the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.**
