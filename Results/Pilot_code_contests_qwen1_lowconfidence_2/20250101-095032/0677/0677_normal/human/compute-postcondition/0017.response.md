The code `q.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the deque object `q`. The value of `u` is taken from `adjacents_list[v][0]`, which means `u` is the first city in the list of cities adjacent to city `v`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of cities
- `s` is an integer representing the starting city
- `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`
- `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`
- `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except for `distance[u]` which is now `distance[v] + 1`
- `q` is a deque object with an additional element `u`
- `v` is the first city in `adjacents_list[v]`
- `u` is the first city in `adjacents_list[v]`

After executing `q.append(u)`, the value of `u` is appended to `q`, making `q` contain two elements: the original element (which was `u` before appending) and the new element `u`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except for `distance[u]` which is now `distance[v] + 1`, `q` is a deque object containing the elements `[original_u, u]`, `v` is the first city in `adjacents_list[v]`, and `u` is the first city in `adjacents_list[v]`**
