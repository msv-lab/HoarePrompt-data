The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`. According to the initial state, `distances1[v]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`. Therefore, the new value of `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, which translates to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged in their initial states.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; stack contains `u`; `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1`; `distances2[u]` is either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`, depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not.**
