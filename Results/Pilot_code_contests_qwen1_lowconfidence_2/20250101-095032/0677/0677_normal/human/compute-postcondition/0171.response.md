The code snippet updates `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `distances1[u]` was previously updated to the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`.
- `distances2[u]` was updated to the maximum of its previous value and `distances2[v] + 1` or `heights1[u]`.

Since `distances1[u]` is now being set to `distances1[v] + 1`, this overwrites the previous value of `distances1[u]` which was a maximum. The value of `distances2[u]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is either `True` or retains its original value `False`. `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being `u`. `distances1[u]` is now `distances1[v] + 1`, while `distances2[u]` remains unchanged as the maximum of its previous value and `distances2[v] + 1` or `heights1[u]`.**
