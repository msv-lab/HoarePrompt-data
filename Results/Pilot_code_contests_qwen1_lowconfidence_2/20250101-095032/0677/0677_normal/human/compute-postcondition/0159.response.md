Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `pi[u]` is `v`: This means that `u` was reached from `v`.
   - `visited[u]` is `True`: This means that node `u` has been visited.
   - `determinate` is `True`: This indicates that the current path is valid and determinate.
   - `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it: This means that the stack now includes `v` followed by `u`.
   - `distances1[u]` is either `max(distances1[v] + 1, heights1[v] + 1)` or `distances1[v] + 1`: This represents the distance from the starting node to `u` using the first set of distances.
   - `distances2[u]` is either `max(heights1[v] + 2, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`: This represents the height constraint from the starting node to `u` using the second set of heights.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each adjacent city `u` of `v`.

3. **State Transition**:
   - Since we are entering a new iteration of the loop, the current `u` in the loop is an adjacent city of `v` (which is already processed and added to the stack).
   - The loop will process `u` and update the states accordingly.

4. **Updated States**:
   - `pi[u]` remains `v` as it was reached from `v`.
   - `visited[u]` remains `True` as it was already visited.
   - `determinate` remains `True` as long as the path remains valid.
   - `stack` will include `v` followed by `u` (new top element).
   - `distances1[u]` will be updated based on the distance calculation from the loop body.
   - `distances2[u]` will be updated based on the height constraint calculation from the loop body.

5. **New Iteration Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `stack` must be non-empty, and the top element of the stack must be a valid adjacent city `u` of `v`.

Given these points, let's summarize the states at the start of the next iteration:

- `pi[u]` remains `v`.
- `visited[u]` remains `True`.
- `determinate` remains `True`.
- `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it.
- `distances1[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic.
- `distances2[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic, and `distances2[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic**.
