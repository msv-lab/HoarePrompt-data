The code snippet updates the value of `distances2[u]`. According to the initial state, `distances2[u]` is currently set to `heights1[u]`. The new value of `distances2[u]` is calculated as `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`.

Given the initial state:
- `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`
- `distances2[v]` is unknown but previously was `heights1[v] + 1` (since `distances1[u]` is `max(distances1[v] + 1, heights1[v] + 1)`)

Therefore, the new value of `distances2[u]` will be `max(heights1[v] + 1 + 1, heights2[u])` which simplifies to `max(heights1[v] + 2, heights2[u])`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is `max(distances1[v] + 1, heights1[v] + 1)`, `distances2[u]` is `max(heights1[v] + 2, heights2[u])`**
