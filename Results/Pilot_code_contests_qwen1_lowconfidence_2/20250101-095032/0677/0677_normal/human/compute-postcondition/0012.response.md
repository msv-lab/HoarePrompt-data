The code assigns the value of `distance[v] + 1` to `distance[u]`. Given the initial state, `distance[u]` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except for `distance[u]` which is now `distance[v] + 1`, `q` is a deque object (unchanged), `v` is the first city in `adjacents_list[v]`, and `u` is the next city in `adjacents_list[v]`**.
