Postcondition: ***`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element, `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.***

Explanation: Since the `else` part does not exist, the postcondition is directly derived from the if part. The `determinate` flag is set to `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, and the `distances2[u]` is updated to `heights1[u]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
