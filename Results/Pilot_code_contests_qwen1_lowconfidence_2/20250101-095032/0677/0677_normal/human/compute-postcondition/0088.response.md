`visited[u]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `pi[u]` remains `v`, and all other entries in `pi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; all other entries in `pi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; all other entries in `pi` remain unchanged**
