The code updates the value of `distances2[u]` to be equal to `heights1[u]`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

- `pi[u]` remains `v`.
- `visited[u]` remains `True`.
- `determinate` remains `True`.
- `stack` remains non-empty with the new top element being `u`.
- `distances1[u]` remains the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`.
- `distances2[u]` is now updated to `heights1[u]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being `u`, `distances1[u]` is the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
