Postcondition: ***`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is a boolean value indicating whether the determination process is completed. `stack` contains `u`. `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1` if `determinate` is `False`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` if `heights2[u] > distances2[v] + 1` and `determinate` is `False`, otherwise it is updated to `heights1[u]` if `determinate` is `False`, and remains unchanged if `determinate` is `True`.***
