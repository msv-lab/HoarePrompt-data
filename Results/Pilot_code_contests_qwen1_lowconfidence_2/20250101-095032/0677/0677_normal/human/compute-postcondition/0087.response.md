The code snippet `pi[u] = v` assigns the value `v` to the key `u` in the dictionary `pi`. Since no specific values for `u` and `v` are given, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that the dictionary `pi` has been updated.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, all other entries in `pi` remain unchanged**
