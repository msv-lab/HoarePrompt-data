`q` is appended with the value of `s`. The value of `s` is an integer representing the starting city, and `q` is a deque object. The other variables (`n`, `adjacents_list`, `distance`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is a deque object containing `[s]`.**
