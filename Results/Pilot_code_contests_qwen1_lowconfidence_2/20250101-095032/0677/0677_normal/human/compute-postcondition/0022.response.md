To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the for loop statement and their necessary initial states.

1. The for loop iterates over `adjacents_list[v]`. This means that `v` should be defined and `adjacents_list[v]` should contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. `v` is initially the first city in the deque `q`. Therefore, `q` must not be empty, as if it were, `v` would be undefined.
3. `adjacents_list` is a list of lists, and `adjacents_list[v]` should contain at least one city to ensure the loop can iterate.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:

- Ensure `q` is not empty.
- Ensure `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `q` must not be empty.
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.

Considering the provided initial states:

- `n` is an integer representing the number of cities.
- `s` is an integer representing the starting city.
- `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`.
- `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is the shortest distance from the starting city `s`.
- `q` is a deque object with the first city removed.
- `v` is the first city in the deque `q`.

Since `v` is the first city in `q`, `q` must not be empty for `v` to be defined. Additionally, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`q` is not empty, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element**
