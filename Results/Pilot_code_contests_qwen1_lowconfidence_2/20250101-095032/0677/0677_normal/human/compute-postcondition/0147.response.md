The code `stack.append(u)` appends the element `u` to the stack. This affects the `stack` variable by adding `u` to its top. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
