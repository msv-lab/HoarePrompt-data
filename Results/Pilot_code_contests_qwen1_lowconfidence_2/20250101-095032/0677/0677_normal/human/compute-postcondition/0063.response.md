`v` is assigned the value popped from the `stack`. The `stack` is a list containing all cities in the DFS order, and since it is non-empty, it will now have one less element after popping. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `n` is the number of cities in Byteforces, `m` is the number of cities being attacked, `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is a list of `m` distinct integers representing the city numbers being attacked, `pi` is a list of integers where `pi[u] = v` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree, `visited` is a list of boolean values `[False, False, ..., False]` (with `n` elements), where the value at index `u` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree, `heights1` and `heights2` are lists of integers representing the height of the tree formed by the attacked cities, `distances1` and `distances2` are lists of integers representing the distance from the root city to each city in the two different scenarios, `visited[numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]]` is `True`, `stack` is a non-empty list containing all cities in the DFS order except for the last one, and `v` is the value popped from the stack.**
