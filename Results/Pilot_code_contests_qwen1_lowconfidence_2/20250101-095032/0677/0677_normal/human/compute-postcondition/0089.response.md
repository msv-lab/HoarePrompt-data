The code `determinate = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `determinate`. This does not affect the values of `pi[u]` or `visited[u]`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `False`**
