`pi[u]` is assigned the value of `v`. The adjacency list `adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, and `u` is not visited. After executing the line of code, `u` is marked as visited (implied by the context that `u` was not visited before).

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`.**
