The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. This updates the value of `distances2[u]` but does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is `max(distances1[v] + 1, heights1[v] + 1)`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
