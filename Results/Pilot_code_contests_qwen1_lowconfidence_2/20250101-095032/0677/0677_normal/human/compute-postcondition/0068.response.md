`determinate` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `determinate` is now `False`, but the states of the other variables (`adjacents_list[v]`, `u`, `pi[u]`, `visited[u]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`**
