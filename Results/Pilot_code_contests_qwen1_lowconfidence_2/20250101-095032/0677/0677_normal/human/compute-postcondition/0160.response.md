The code `pi[u] = v` assigns the value of `v` to `pi[u]`. This changes the value of `pi[u]` from its previous value to `v`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic, and `distances2[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic**
