The code `pi[u] = v` updates the value of `pi[u]` to `v`. This changes the value of `pi[u]` directly. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is set to `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v`, `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
