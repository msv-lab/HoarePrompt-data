`distance[u]` is assigned the value `distance[v] + 1`. The value of `distance[v]` is known, but the value of `distance[u]` was previously -1. After executing the code, `distance[u]` will be updated to `distance[v] + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `q` is a queue without its leftmost element.
- `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city.
- `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.
- `v` is the new last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`q` is a queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city, `v` is the new last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`), and `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`.**
