The code updates the `distance[u]` variable to `distance[v] + 1`. Here, `u` is the next city in `adjacents_list[v]` and `v` is the first city in `adjacents_list[v]`. Given that `distance[u]` was previously `-1`, it will now be updated to `distance[v] + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except for `distance[u]` which is now `distance[v] + 1`, `q` is a deque object with an additional element `u`, `v` is the first city in `adjacents_list[v]`, and `u` is the next city in `adjacents_list[v]`**.
