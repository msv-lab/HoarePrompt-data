The code snippet appends the variable `u` to the stack. This means the stack will now contain the current value of `u` as its new top element. No other changes occur to the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element, `distances1[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario, and `distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario.**
