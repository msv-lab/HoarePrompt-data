`pi[u]` is assigned the value `v`. This means that the parent of city `u` in the DFS tree is now `v`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `True` or `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty (but does not contain the top element which was popped), `distances1[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario, and `distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario, and `visited[u]` is `False`.**
