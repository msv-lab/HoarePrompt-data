Postcondition: ***`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element. If `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, then `distances1[u]` is the maximum of `distances1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. If `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, `distances2[u]` is the maximum of `distances2[v] + 1` and `heights2[u]`, and the height of `u` plus one is equal to the value of `distances1[u]`. Otherwise, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, and the height of `u` plus one is less than or equal to the distance from the root city to `v` considering the attacked cities scenario. If `heights1[u] + 1 <= distances2[v]`, then no changes are made to `distances1[u]`, `distances2[u]`, and the height of `u` plus one remains the same as the distance from the root city to `v` considering the attacked cities scenario.***
