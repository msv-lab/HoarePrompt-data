The code `v = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the deque `q`. Since `q` initially contains `[s]`, the leftmost element is `s`. This means `v` will be assigned the value `s`.

After this operation, the deque `q` will no longer contain any elements because we removed its only element.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` (number of cities), `s` (starting city), `adjacents_list` (list of adjacent cities), and `distance` (list with `distance[s]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1).

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is an empty deque object, `v` is `s`.**
