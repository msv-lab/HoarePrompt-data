The code updates `distances2[u]` to be equal to `heights1[u]`. This changes the value of `distances2[u]` from its previous value, which was unchanged from `distances1[u]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `adjacents_list[v]` is not empty.
- `n` is the number of cities in Byteforces.
- `m` is the number of cities being attacked.
- `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is a list of `m` distinct integers representing the city numbers being attacked.
- `pi[u]` is updated to `v`.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values `[False, False, ..., False]` (with `n` elements) where the value at index `u` is now `True`.
- `heights1` and `heights2` are lists of integers representing the height of the tree formed by the attacked cities.
- `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.
- `distances2[u]` is updated to `heights1[u]`.
- `visited[numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]]` is `True`.
- `stack` has `u` appended as its second-to-last element.
- `determinate` remains `True` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `determinate` remains `False`.
