The code initializes a deque object `q`. A deque (double-ended queue) is a list-like container where elements can be added or removed from both ends. In this case, `q` is being initialized but no elements are added or removed yet. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is a deque object.**
