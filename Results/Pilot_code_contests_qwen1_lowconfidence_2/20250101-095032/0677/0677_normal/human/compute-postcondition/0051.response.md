Output State: **`q` is either a queue containing cities yet to be processed, or an empty queue if all cities have been processed, `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must be processed, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city, and `v` is the last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`).** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the adjacent cities of the current city `v`.
- For each city `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, if `distance[u]` is `-1`, it means that `u` has not been processed yet. The distance from `s` to `u` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`, indicating that the shortest path to `u` is through `v`. City `u` is then added to the queue `q` for further processing.
- The process continues until all cities adjacent to the current city `v` have been processed, or there are no more cities to process.
- Once all cities have been processed, the queue `q` will be empty, and `distance` will contain the shortest distances from the starting city `s` to all other cities.
