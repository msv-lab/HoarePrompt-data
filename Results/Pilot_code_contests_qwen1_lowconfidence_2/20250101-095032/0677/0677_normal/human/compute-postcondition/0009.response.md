The code snippet appends the city `u` to the deque `q`. Before the code was executed, `u` was a city adjacent to `v`, and `distance[u]` was set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is a deque object containing the element `u`, `v` is `s`, `adjacents_list[v]` is not an empty list; `distance[u]` is now 1.**
