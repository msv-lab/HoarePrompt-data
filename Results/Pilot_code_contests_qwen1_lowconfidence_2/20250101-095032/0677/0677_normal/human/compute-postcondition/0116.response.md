Postcondition: ***`u` is an unvisited adjacent vertex of `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `determinate` remains `False`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `stack` contains `u` and `u`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`. If `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, then `determinate` becomes `True`, `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is updated to either `max(max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1, heights2[u])` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1`. Otherwise, `determinate` remains `False`.***
