Postcondition: ***`u` is a vertex. If `not visited[u]`, then `visited[u]` is set to `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `determinate` is `True`, stack contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is either `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or remains as the previous value depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur if the condition `not visited[u]` is true.***
