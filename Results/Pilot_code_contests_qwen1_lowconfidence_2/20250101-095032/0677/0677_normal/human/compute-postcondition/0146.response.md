The line `determinate = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `determinate`. This updates the value of `determinate` but does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
