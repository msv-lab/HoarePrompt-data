According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `adjacents_list[v]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.
- `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`.
- `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`.
- `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`.
- `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element.
- `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.
- `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, where `u` is the city considered in the if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `adjacents_list[v]` still contains at least one element. Since `u` was added to the top of the stack in the previous iteration, it means there is at least one adjacent city left to process. Therefore, `adjacents_list[v]` still contains at least one element.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`.
- `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`.
- `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`.
- `stack` is now non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v`.
- `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.
- `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.

State: **`pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v`, `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**.
