`distance[u]` is assigned the value of `distance[v] + 1`. This means the distance of node `u` from the starting point is updated to be one more than the distance of node `v` from the starting point. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is not empty with `u` added, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`**
