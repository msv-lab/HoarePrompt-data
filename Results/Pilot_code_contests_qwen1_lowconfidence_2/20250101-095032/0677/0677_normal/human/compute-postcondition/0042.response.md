Postcondition: **`q` is a queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city, and `v` is the new last city processed (which was previously the leftmost element of `q`). If `distance[u] == -1`, then `distance[u]` is updated to `distance[v] + 1` and `u` is appended to `q`. If `distance[u] != -1`, no changes are made.**
