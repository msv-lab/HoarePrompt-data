The variable `determinate` is set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it
- `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`
- `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
