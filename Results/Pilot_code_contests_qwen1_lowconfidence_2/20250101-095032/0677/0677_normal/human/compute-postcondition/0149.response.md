The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `distances1[u]` is initially `distances1[v] + 1`.
- `distances2[v]` is equal to `heights1[v]`.

Therefore, the new value of `distances1[u]` will be `max(heights1[u], heights1[v] + 1)`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their states from the initial state.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is `max(distances1[v] + 1, heights1[v] + 1)`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
