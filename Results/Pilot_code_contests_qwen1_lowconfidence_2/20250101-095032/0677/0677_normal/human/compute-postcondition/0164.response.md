`determinate` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `pi[u]`, `visited[u]`, `stack`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being `u`, `distances1[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic, `distances2[u]` is updated based on the loop body logic**
