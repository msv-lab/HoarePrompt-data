The code sets the variable `determinate` to `True`. This directly changes the value of `determinate` while the other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element, `distances1[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario, `distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario, and the height of `u` plus one is greater than the distance from the root city to `v` considering the attacked cities scenario.**
