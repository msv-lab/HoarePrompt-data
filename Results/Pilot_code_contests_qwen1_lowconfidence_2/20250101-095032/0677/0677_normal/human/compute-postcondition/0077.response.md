The code updates the value of `distances2[u]` to be equal to `heights1[u]`. Given the initial conditions, we know:

- `adjacents_list[v]` is not empty.
- `u` is visited.
- `pi[u]` is `v`.
- `visited[u]` is `True`.
- `determinate` is `True`.
- `stack` contains `u`.
- `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 1`.
- `heights1[u] + 1` is less than or equal to `distances2[v]`.

Since `distances2[u]` is updated to `heights1[u]`, the only variable that changes is `distances2[u]`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.**
