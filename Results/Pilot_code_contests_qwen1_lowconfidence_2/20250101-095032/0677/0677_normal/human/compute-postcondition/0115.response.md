The code assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. This means that `distances2[u]` is now equal to `heights1[u]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`u` is an unvisited adjacent vertex of `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `stack` contains `u` and `u`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
