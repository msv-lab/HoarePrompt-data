According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `len(q)`. If the length of the queue `q` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is empty (`len(q) == 0`). Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `len(q)` is greater than 0.

The only state that needs to be adjusted is the condition of the queue `q`.

State: **`q` is not empty, `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city, and `v` is the last city processed**
