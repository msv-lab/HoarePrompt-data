Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is empty, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is empty, `distances1[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario, and `distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario.**

### Explanation:
1. **`adjacents_list[v]` is empty**: Since the loop continues until the stack is empty, and the stack starts with all cities in the DFS order, once the stack is emptied, no more cities can be popped, implying that `adjacents_list[v]` is empty for all `v`.

2. **`pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`**: The loop sets the parent of each city `u` to `v` as long as `u` is not already visited. This means that by the end of the loop, the parent of each city in the DFS tree starting from `v` is correctly set.

3. **`visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`**: Since the loop continues to push and pop cities from the stack, and all cities are eventually processed, `visited[u]` is set to `True` for all cities in the DFS tree starting from `v`.

4. **`determinate` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`**: The value of `determinate` is set to `True` when certain conditions are met inside the loop. By the end of the loop, `determinate` is `True` for all cities in the DFS tree starting from `v`.

5. **`stack` is empty**: As mentioned earlier, the loop continues until the stack is empty, so by the end of the loop, `stack` is empty.

6. **`distances1[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario**: The loop updates `distances1[u]` based on the conditions inside the loop, ensuring that `distances1[u]` represents the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering the attacked cities scenario.

7. **`distances2[u]` is the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario**: Similarly, `distances2[u]` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, ensuring that `distances2[u]` represents the maximum distance from the root city to each city `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` considering another scenario.
