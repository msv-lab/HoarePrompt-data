`q` is a queue with its leftmost element being the next city to be processed, `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.

The code `q.append(u)` appends the city `u` to the queue `q`. This means that the next city to be processed in the queue will now be `u`.

Output State: **`q` is a queue with its leftmost element being the next city to be processed (now `u`), `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city.**
