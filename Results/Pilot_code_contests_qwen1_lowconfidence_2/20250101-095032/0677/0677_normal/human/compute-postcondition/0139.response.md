Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `pi[u]` is set for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v` with `pi[u] = v`, `visited[u]` is `True` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `determinate` is `False` for all cities `u` in the DFS tree starting from `v`, `stack` is now non-empty with `u` as its new top element, `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `distances1[u] = distances1[v] + 1` updates the value of `distances1[u]` to the current value of `distances1[v]` plus 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.
