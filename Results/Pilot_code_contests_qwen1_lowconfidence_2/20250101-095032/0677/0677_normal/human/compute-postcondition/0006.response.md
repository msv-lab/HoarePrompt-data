To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions required for the loop to proceed. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Variable `v`:**
   - The variable `v` is initialized to `s`, which is the starting city.
   - For the loop to execute, `v` must point to a valid city in the `adjacents_list`.

2. **List `adjacents_list`:**
   - The `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains the cities adjacent to city `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one city (i.e., `adjacents_list[v]` must not be an empty list).

3. **Variable `u`:**
   - The loop iterates over each city `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`.
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `s`, `distance`, `q`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the loop condition.

Given these points, let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `v` should be initialized to `s`, which is the starting city.
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one city (i.e., `adjacents_list[v]` must not be an empty list).

Thus, the required state modifications are:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is an empty deque object, `v` is `s`, and `adjacents_list[v]` must not be an empty list**.
