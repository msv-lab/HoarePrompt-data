Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is the shortest distance from the starting city `s`, `q` is a deque object containing all cities that are at the current shortest distance from the starting city, `v` is the last city processed in the deque.**

Explanation:
- After the loop finishes executing, every city `u` that is reachable from the starting city `s` will have its distance correctly set to the shortest distance from `s`. This is achieved by setting `distance[u] = distance[v] + 1` whenever `u` is a direct neighbor of `v` and `distance[u]` was initially `-1`.
- The deque `q` will contain all cities that are at the current shortest distance from the starting city `s`. As we process each city `v` and update its neighbors `u`, `u` is added to `q` only if its distance was not yet known.
- The variable `v` will be the last city processed in the deque `q`, meaning it is the city with the current shortest known distance from the starting city `s`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., there are no neighbors for the starting city `s`), then:
- `distance` will still be set such that `distance[s]` is `0` and all other distances will be `-1`.
- `q` will be an empty deque object since no cities are added to it.
- `v` will be `s` because the loop starts with `v` being `s` and no further processing occurs.

Therefore, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all possible iterations is as described above.
