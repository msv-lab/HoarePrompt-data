The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` updates the value of `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. According to the initial state, `distances2[u]` was either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`, depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not. Since the value of `distances2[u]` is now explicitly set to `heights1[u]`, the previous conditional assignment no longer applies.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`; `visited[u]` is `True`; `determinate` is `True`; stack contains `u`; `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
