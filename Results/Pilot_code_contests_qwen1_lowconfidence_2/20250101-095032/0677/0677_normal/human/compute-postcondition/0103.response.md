The code `pi[u] = v` assigns the value `v` to the variable `pi[u]`. This updates the value of `pi[u]` from its previous value (`v`) to `v` again, which doesn't change it since it was already `v`.

All other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`u` is an unvisited adjacent vertex of `v`, `visited[u]` is `False`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `determinate` is `True`, stack contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is either `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or remains as the previous value depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not.**
