The code updates `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `distances1[u]` was initially set to `max(distances1[v] + 1, heights1[v] + 1)`. Since `distances1[v]` is now being incremented by 1, the updated value of `distances1[u]` will be `distances1[v] + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is true, `stack` is non-empty with the new top element being an adjacent city `u` of `v` and `u` appended to it, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, and `distances2[u]` is either `max(heights1[v] + 2, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]` regardless of the if condition.**
