Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cities, `s` is an integer representing the starting city, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`, and `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `distance[s]` which is 0; `q` is an empty deque object, `v` is `s`, and `adjacents_list[v]` is not an empty list; there exists a city `u` such that `distance[u]` is currently -1**
