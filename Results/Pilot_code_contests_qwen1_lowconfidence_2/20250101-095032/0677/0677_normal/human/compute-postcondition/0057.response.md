`distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `distances1[v]` was previously updated based on the condition involving `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v]`, but the exact value of `distances1[v]` is not specified. However, since the code only updates `distances1[u]` and does not affect any other variables directly, we can conclude that the updated value of `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `n` is the number of cities in Byteforces, `m` is the number of cities being attacked, `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is a list of `m` distinct integers representing the city numbers being attacked, `pi[u]` is updated to `v`, `visited` is a list of boolean values `[False, False, ..., False]` (with `n` elements) where the value at index `u` is now `True`, `heights1` and `heights2` are lists of integers representing the height of the tree formed by the attacked cities, `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` remains unchanged, `visited[numbers_of_attacked_cities[0]]` is `True`, `stack` has `u` appended as its second-to-last element, and `determinate` remains `True` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise `determinate` remains `False`.
