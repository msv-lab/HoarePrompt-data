The variable `determinate` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `determinate` was `True` before the execution of the code. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is an unvisited adjacent vertex of `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `determinate` is `False`, stack contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is either `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1) + 1` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, and `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or remains as the previous value depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` or not.**
