The code assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. The previous value of `distances2[u]` is not specified, so we only know that it is now equal to `heights1[u]`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` contains `u`, and `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
