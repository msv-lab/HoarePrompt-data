The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:
- `adjacents_list[v]` is not empty
- `u` is visited
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `stack` contains `u`
- `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]`
- `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`

Since `heights1[u] + 1` equals `distances1[v]` and `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`, it follows that `heights1[u] + 1` is also greater than `distances2[v] + 1`.

Therefore, `distances1[u]` will be set to `heights1[u] + 1`, because this value is the maximum between `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u] + 1`, and `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`**
