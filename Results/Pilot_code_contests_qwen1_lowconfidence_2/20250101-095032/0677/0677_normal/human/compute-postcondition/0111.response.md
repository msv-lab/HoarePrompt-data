Postcondition: ***`determinate` is `True`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `pi[u]` is `v`, `disteterminate` is `False`, stack contains `u` and `u`. Depending on the condition `distances1[u] == heights1[u]`, `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)` and `distances2[u]` is either `max(max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1), heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`.***
