The code `determinate = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `determinate`. This updates the value of `determinate` from `False` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`adjacents_list[v]` is not empty, `u` is visited, `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u`, heights1[u] + 1 equals distances1[v], and heights1[u] + 1 is greater than distances2[v]**
