`distance[u]` is assigned the value `distance[v] + 1`. This means that the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to city `u` is calculated by adding 1 to the shortest distance from `s` to city `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a queue with its leftmost element being the next city to be processed, `adjacents_list[v]` is a list of all cities that must contain at least one city, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`, `distance` is a list where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting city `s` to each city**
