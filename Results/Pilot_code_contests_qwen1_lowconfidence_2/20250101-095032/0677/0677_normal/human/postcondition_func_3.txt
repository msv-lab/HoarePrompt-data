The function `func_4` accepts a city index `s`, a list of lists `adjacents_list` representing the adjacency of cities, a list of integers `heights1` representing the heights or distances of cities, and two lists of integers `distances1` and `distances2` used to store calculated distances. After executing the function, `distances1[s]` will be updated to the maximum height value found among its adjacent cities plus one. If `distances1[s]` is less than the maximum height value from its adjacent cities plus one, then `distances2[s]` will be updated to `distances1[s]`. If `distances2[s]` is less than the second maximum height value from its adjacent cities plus one, then `distances2[s]` will be updated to this value. If no adjacent cities are present (i.e., `adjacents_list[s]` is empty), `distances1[s]` and `distances2[s]` will retain their original values.
