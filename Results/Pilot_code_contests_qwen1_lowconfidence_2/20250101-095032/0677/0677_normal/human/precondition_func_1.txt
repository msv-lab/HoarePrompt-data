n is an integer representing the number of cities in Byteforces, m is an integer representing the number of cities being attacked, `numbers_of_attacked_cities` is a list of m distinct integers representing the cities being attacked, `adjacents_list` is a list of length n where each element is a list of integers representing the adjacent cities to the city index, `pi` is a list of length n initialized to None representing the parent of each city in the DFS traversal, `count_attacked_cities_subtree` is a list of length n initialized to 0 representing the count of attacked cities in the subtree rooted at each city, `important_cities` is a list of length n initialized to True representing whether each city is important or not.
