n is an integer representing the number of cities in Byteforces, m is an integer representing the number of cities being attacked, numbers_of_attacked_cities is a list of m distinct integers representing the city numbers being attacked, adjacents_list is a list of adjacency lists where adjacents_list[i] contains all cities adjacent to city i, pi is a list of integers representing the parent of each city in the DFS tree, visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether a city has been visited or not, heights1 and heights2 are lists of integers representing the height of the tree formed by the attacked cities, and distances1 and distances2 are lists of integers representing the distance from the root city to each city in the two different scenarios.
