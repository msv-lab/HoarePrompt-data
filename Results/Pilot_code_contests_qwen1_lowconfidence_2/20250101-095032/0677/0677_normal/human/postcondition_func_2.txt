- If there are no cities being attacked (`m == 0`), the function does not handle this case explicitly. In such a scenario, the `visited` list might not be modified, and the `stack` and `pi` would remain empty. This could lead to unexpected behavior if these variables are later accessed without proper initialization.
- The function assumes that `heights1` and `heights2` are already initialized to appropriate sizes and values before calling the function. If these arrays are not properly initialized, the function may produce incorrect results.
- The function does not return any values; it modifies the `heights1` and `heights2` arrays in place. If these arrays are needed outside the function, they should be passed as mutable references or returned as part of a tuple or dictionary.
