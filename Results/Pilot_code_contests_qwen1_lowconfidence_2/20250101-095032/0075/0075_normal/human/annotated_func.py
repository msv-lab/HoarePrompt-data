#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2000000000.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]
    res = 0
    if (a == 0) :
        res += b[0]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2000000000; `a` is an integer; `b` is a list `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]`; `res` is 1 if `a` is 0, and remains unchanged otherwise.
    while a > 0:
        res += b[a % 16]
        
        a /= 16
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `res` is the sum of the values of `b[a_original % 16]` for each iteration where `a_original` is the original value of `a` and `a` is greater than 0
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It takes an integer `a` as input from the user, where `0 ≤ a ≤ 2000000000`. The function then iterates over the last four bits of `a` (by repeatedly taking `a % 16` and using the corresponding value from the list `b`), sums these values, and prints the result. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has printed an integer `res`, which is the sum of the values in `b` corresponding to the last four bits of the original input `a`. The function handles the case where `a` is 0 by initializing `res` to 1. However, the function does not handle cases where `a` is negative or exceeds `2000000000` beyond the specified range, and it also does not validate the input `a` to ensure it falls within the given constraints.
