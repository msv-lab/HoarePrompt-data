The code `res += b[a % 16]` updates the value of `res` by adding the value of `b[a % 16]` to it. However, the initial state only provides information about `a` being greater than 0 and does not provide any specific values for `a`, `b`, or `res`. Without specific values, the exact value of `res` cannot be determined, but we know that `res` has been updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is greater than 0; `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0; `res` is updated by adding `b[a % 16]` to its current value**
