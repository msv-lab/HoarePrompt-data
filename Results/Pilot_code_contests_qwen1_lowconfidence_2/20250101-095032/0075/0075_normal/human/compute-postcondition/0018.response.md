Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It takes an integer `a` as input from the user, where `0 ≤ a ≤ 2000000000`. The function then iterates over the last four bits of `a` (by repeatedly taking `a % 16` and using the corresponding value from the list `b`), sums these values, and prints the result. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has printed an integer `res`, which is the sum of the values in `b` corresponding to the last four bits of the original input `a`. The function handles the case where `a` is 0 by initializing `res` to 1. However, the function does not handle cases where `a` is negative or exceeds `2000000000` beyond the specified range, and it also does not validate the input `a` to ensure it falls within the given constraints.**
