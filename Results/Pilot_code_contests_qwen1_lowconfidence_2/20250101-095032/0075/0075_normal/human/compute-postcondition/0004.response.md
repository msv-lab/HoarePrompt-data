`res` is incremented by the value of `b[0]`. Given that `b` is a list with the first element being `1`, `res` will be updated to `1`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2000000000; `a` is 0; `b` is a list `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]; `res` is 1**
