Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where the input `a` is outside the specified range (`0 ≤ a ≤ 2000000000`). Specifically, the code does not check if the input `a` is within the valid range before processing it. Additionally, the code does not handle negative inputs, although the problem description specifies that the input should be a non-negative integer.

To ensure the program works correctly for every potential case, the code should include validation to check if the input is within the specified range. Here is an example of how the code could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    if a < 0 or a > 2000000000:
        print("Input out of range")
        return
    
    b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0]
    res = 0
    if a == 0:
        res += b[0]
    while a > 0:
        res += b[a % 16]
        a //= 16
    print(res)
```

This modified version of the code includes a check to ensure the input is within the valid range, making the program more robust and adhering to the problem description for every potential case.
