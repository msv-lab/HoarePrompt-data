Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of digits '1' in the binary representation of the input number `n`. However, the program seems to be attempting to convert the number into hexadecimal and summing up specific values from a predefined list `b`.

For example, consider the input `11`:
- The binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which contains two `1`s.
- The program should output `2`.
- However, the program outputs `0` because it incorrectly sums up values from the list `b` based on the hexadecimal digits of `11` (which are `B`), instead of counting the number of `1`s in the binary representation.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one input case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
