The code `swaps2 = min(change_red2, change_black2)` assigns the minimum value between `change_red2` and `change_black2` to the variable `swaps2`. Since the exact values of `change_red2` and `change_black2` are not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `swaps2` is the minimum of these two values. The values of `change_red2` and `change_black2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`swaps2` is the minimum of `change_red2` and `change_black2`; `change_red2` is its original value; `change_black2` is its original value.**
