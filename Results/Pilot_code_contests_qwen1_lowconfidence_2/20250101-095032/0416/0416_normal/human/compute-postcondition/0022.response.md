The code `swaps = min(change_red, change_black)` assigns the minimum value between `change_red` and `change_black` to the variable `swaps`. However, since the values of `change_red` and `change_black` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `swaps`. The only thing we know is that `swaps` now holds the minimum of the two values.

Output State: **`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `change_red` and `change_black` retain their original values**
