The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream. The first line of input is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), representing the number of cockroaches, and the second line is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroaches and red cockroaches, respectively. Based on this input, the function returns either a count of black cockroaches or a count of red cockroaches, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided output cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', and then return the count of either black ('b') or red ('r') cockroaches, depending on the context not specified here.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', and returns the count of either black ('b') or red ('r') cockroaches.**
