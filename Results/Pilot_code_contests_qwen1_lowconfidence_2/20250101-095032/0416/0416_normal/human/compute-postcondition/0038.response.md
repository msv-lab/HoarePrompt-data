Postcondition: ***`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_red2` is either 1 or 2, `change_black2` is `change_black + 1`, `line` is a non-empty list or iterable, `idx` is 3, and `val` is the third element of `line`. If `idx % 2 == 0` and `val == 'r'`, then `change_red2` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
