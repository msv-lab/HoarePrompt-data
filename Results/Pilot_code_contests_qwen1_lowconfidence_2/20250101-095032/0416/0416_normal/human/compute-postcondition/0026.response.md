The code `change_black2 = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `change_black2`. This does not affect the values of `swaps`, `color`, `total`, or `change_red2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `total` is `swaps + color`; `change_red2` is 0; `change_black2` is 0.

Output State: **`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `total` is `swaps + color`; `change_red2` is 0; `change_black2` is 0**.
