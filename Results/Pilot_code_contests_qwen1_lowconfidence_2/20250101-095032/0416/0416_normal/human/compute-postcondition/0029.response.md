`change_black2` is incremented by 1. The value of `swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_red2` is 0, `change_black2` is now `change_black2 + 1`, `line` is a non-empty list or iterable, `idx` is 2 (since `idx` was incremented from 1), and `val` is the second element of `line`.
Output State: **`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_red2` is 0, `change_black2` is `change_black2 + 1`, `line` is a non-empty list or iterable, `idx` is 2, `val` is the second element of `line`**
