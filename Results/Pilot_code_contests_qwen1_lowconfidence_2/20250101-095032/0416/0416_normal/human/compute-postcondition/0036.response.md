Postcondition: ***`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_red2` is 1, `change_black2` is `change_black + 1`, `line` is a non-empty list or iterable, `idx` is 3, and `val` is the third element of `line`. If `idx % 2 == 1` and `val == 'b'`, then `change_black2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
