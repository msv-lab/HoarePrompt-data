`change_black` is incremented by 1. Since `change_black` was initially either 0 or 1, after adding 1, it will now be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is either 1 or 2, `change_red` is 1, `idx` is 3, and `val` is the fourth character in `line`.**
