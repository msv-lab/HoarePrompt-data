`change_red2` is incremented by 1. Initially, `change_red2` is either 1 or 2. Incrementing it by 1 will change its value to 2 if it was 1, or remain 3 if it was 2. The states of the other variables (`idx`, `val`, `swaps`, `color`, `total`, `change_black2`, and `line`) are not affected.

Output State: **`idx` is 4, `val` is the fourth element of `line`, `change_red2` is 2 or 3, `swaps` remains the same, `color` remains the same, `total` remains the same, `change_black2` is `change_black + 2`, and `line` remains the same.**
