Postcondition: **`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_red2` is 0, `change_black2` is 0, `line` is a non-empty list or iterable, `idx` is 1 (since idx was incremented), `val` is the second element of `line` (since idx is now 1 and starts from the first element)**

Note: The postcondition assumes that `idx` is incremented to 1 because the condition checks `idx % 2 == 1`, which means `idx` was originally 0, and after entering the if statement, `idx` becomes 1. Also, `val` is updated to be the second element of `line` since `idx` is now 1.
