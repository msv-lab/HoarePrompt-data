`change_red` is incremented by 1. The value of `change_red` was originally 2, so now it is 3. The values of `n`, `line`, `change_black`, and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is 2 or 3, `change_red` is 3, and `idx` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is 2 or 3, `change_red` is 3, `idx` is 4**
