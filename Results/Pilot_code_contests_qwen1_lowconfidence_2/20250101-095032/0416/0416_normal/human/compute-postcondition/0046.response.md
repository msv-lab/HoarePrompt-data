`swaps2` is the minimum of `change_red2` and `change_black2`; `change_red2` is its original value; `change_black2` is its original value. The code assigns `color2` the value of `max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2`. 

Since `swaps2` is the minimum of `change_red2` and `change_black2`, let's denote `change_red2` as `r` and `change_black2` as `b`. Thus, `swaps2 = min(r, b)`. The value of `color2` is calculated as `max(r, b) - min(r, b)`.

Therefore, the value of `color2` depends on whether `r` or `b` is larger:
- If `r > b`, then `color2 = r - b`.
- If `b > r`, then `color2 = b - r`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is:

Output State: **`swaps2` is the minimum of `change_red2` and `change_black2`; `change_red2` is its original value; `change_black2` is its original value; `color2` is either `change_red2 - change_black2` if `change_red2 > change_black2` or `change_black2 - change_red2` if `change_black2 > change_red2`.**
