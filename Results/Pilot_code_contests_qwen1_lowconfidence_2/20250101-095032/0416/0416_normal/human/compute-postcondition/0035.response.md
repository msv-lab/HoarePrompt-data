`change_black2` is incremented by 1. Initially, `change_black2` is the same as `change_black`. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State is: `swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_red2` is 1, `change_black2` is `change_black + 1`, `line` is a non-empty list or iterable, `idx` is 3, `val` is the third element of `line`.
