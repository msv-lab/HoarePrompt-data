The code assigns the sum of `swaps` and `color` to `total`. 

- `swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`.
- `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`.

After the code executes:

- `total` is assigned the value of `swaps + color`.
- The values of `swaps` and `color` remain unchanged from their initial definitions.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `total` is `swaps + color`.**
