The code `change_black2 += 1` increments the value of `change_black2` by 1. Since `change_black2` was previously `change_black + 1`, the new value of `change_black2` will be `change_black + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is 4, `val` is the fourth element of `line`, `change_red2` remains 1 or 2, `swaps` remains the same, `color` remains the same, `total` remains the same, `change_black2` is `change_black + 2`, `line` remains the same.**
