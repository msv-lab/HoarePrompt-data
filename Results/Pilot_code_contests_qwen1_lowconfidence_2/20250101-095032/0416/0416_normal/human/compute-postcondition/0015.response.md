Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is either 1 or 2, `change_red` is 2, `idx` is 3. If `idx` is odd and the fourth character in `line` is 'r', then `change_black` remains unchanged at either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `change_black` remains unchanged at either 1 or 2.***
