The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of cockroaches. Since `raw_input()` is used, the input should be provided in a way that it can be converted to an integer. The second line of input, which is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input representing the number of cockroaches, the string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r' remains unchanged.**
