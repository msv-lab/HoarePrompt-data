Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is either 0 or 1, `change_red` is 0, `idx` is 0, and `val` is the first character in `line`. If `idx` is even and `val` is 'b', then `change_black` is 1. Otherwise, `change_black` remains 0.***
