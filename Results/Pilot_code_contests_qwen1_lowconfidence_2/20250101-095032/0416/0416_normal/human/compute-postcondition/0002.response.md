The code `change_red = 0` initializes the variable `change_red` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so the only change is the introduction of `change_red` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input representing the number of cockroaches, `line` is the string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_red` is 0.**
