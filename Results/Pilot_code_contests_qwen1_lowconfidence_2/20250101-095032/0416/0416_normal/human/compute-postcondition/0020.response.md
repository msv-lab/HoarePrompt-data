Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is 2 or 3, `change_red` is 3, `idx` is 4. If `idx % 2 == 1` and `val == 'r'`, then the value of `change_black` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `line`, `change_black`, `change_red`, and `idx` remain unchanged.***
