The code `change_red += 1` increments the value of `change_red` by 1. Given the initial state where `change_red` is 0, after this operation, `change_red` will become 1. The other variables (`n`, `line`, `change_black`, `idx`, and `val`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is either 0 or 1, `change_red` is 1, `idx` is 1, and `val` is the second character in `line`.**
