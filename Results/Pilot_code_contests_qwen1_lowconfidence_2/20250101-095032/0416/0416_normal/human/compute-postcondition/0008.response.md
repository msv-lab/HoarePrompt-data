Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is either 0 or 1, `change_red` is 0, `idx` is 1 (since it was incremented from 0), and `val` is the second character in `line`. If `idx` is odd and `val` is 'r', then `change_red` becomes 1. Otherwise, `change_red` remains 0.***
