Postcondition: ***`idx` is 4, `val` is the fourth element of `line`, `change_red2` remains 1 or 2, `swaps` remains the same, `color` remains the same, `total` remains the same, `change_black2` is `change_black + 2`, and `line` remains the same.***

This postcondition combines both the if and else parts, ensuring that the conditions and state changes are accurately represented. If the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b'` evaluates to true, the specified state changes occur. If false, no changes occur beyond `change_black2` being incremented by 2.
