`change_red` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `change_black` remains unchanged as it is only modified under certain conditions which are not met here (since `idx` is 3, which is odd). All other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is either 1 or 2, `change_red` is 2, `idx` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', `change_black` is either 1 or 2, `change_red` is 2, `idx` is 3.**
