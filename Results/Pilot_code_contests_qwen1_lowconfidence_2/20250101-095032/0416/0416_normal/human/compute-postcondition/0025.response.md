The given code does not affect any existing variables and introduces a new variable `change_red2` which is set to 0. This does not impact the values of `swaps`, `color`, or `total`.

Output State: **`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`; `total` is `swaps + color`; `change_red2` is 0.**
