Postcondition: ***`swaps` is the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `color` is the maximum of `change_red` and `change_black` minus the minimum of `change_red` and `change_black`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_red2` is 0, `change_black2` is incremented by 1 if `val` is 'b' and `idx` is odd (i.e., `idx % 2 == 1`), `line` is a non-empty list or iterable, `idx` is 2, `val` is the second element of `line`***
