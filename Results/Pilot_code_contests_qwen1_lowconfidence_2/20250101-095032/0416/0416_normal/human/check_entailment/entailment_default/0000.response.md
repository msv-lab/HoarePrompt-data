Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of moves needed to alternate the colors of the cockroaches. The program iterates through the string twice, once checking for mismatches in even-indexed positions and once in odd-indexed positions. It counts the number of changes required for each case and prints the minimum of the two counts. This ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly, including strings composed entirely of one color, alternating colors, and mixed distributions. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description and the provided output hints.
