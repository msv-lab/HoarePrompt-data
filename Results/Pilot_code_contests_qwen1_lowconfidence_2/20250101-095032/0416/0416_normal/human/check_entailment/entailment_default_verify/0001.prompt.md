You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anatoly lives in the university dorm as many other students do. As you know, cockroaches are also living there together with students. Cockroaches might be of two colors: black and red. There are n cockroaches living in Anatoly's room.

Anatoly just made all his cockroaches to form a single line. As he is a perfectionist, he would like the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate. He has a can of black paint and a can of red paint. In one turn he can either swap any two cockroaches, or take any single cockroach and change it's color.

Help Anatoly find out the minimum number of turns he needs to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of cockroaches.

The second line contains a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroach and red cockroach respectively.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves Anatoly has to perform in order to make the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate.

Examples

Input

5
rbbrr


Output

Input

bbbbb


Output

2


Input

3
rbr


Output

0

Note

In the first sample, Anatoly has to swap third and fourth cockroaches. He needs 1 turn to do this.

In the second sample, the optimum answer is to paint the second and the fourth cockroaches red. This requires 2 turns.

In the third sample, the colors of cockroaches in the line are alternating already, thus the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    line = raw_input()
    change_red = 0
    change_black = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b':
            change_black += 1
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r':
            change_red += 1
    swaps = min(change_red, change_black)
    color = max(change_red, change_black) - swaps
    total = swaps + color
    change_red2 = 0
    change_black2 = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b':
            change_black2 += 1
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'r':
            change_red2 += 1
    swaps2 = min(change_red2, change_black2)
    color2 = max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2
    total2 = swaps2 + color2
    print(min(total, total2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial arrangement of cockroaches already satisfies the alternating condition. For example, consider the input:

```
3
rbr
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `0` because the colors of cockroaches in the line are already alternating. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of swaps needed, resulting in an output of `0` instead of the correct `0`. 

To fix this, the program should check if the initial arrangement already satisfies the alternating condition before performing any calculations. Here is a modified version of the function to handle this case correctly:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    line = input()
    
    # Check if the initial arrangement is already alternating
    if all(line[i] != line[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        print(0)
        return
    
    change_red = 0
    change_black = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b':
            change_black += 1
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r':
            change_red += 1
    swaps = min(change_red, change_black)
    color = max(change_red, change_black) - swaps
    total = swaps + color
    change_red2 = 0
    change_black2 = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b':
            change_black2 += 1
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'r':
            change_red2 += 1
    swaps2 = min(change_red2, change_black2)
    color2 = max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2
    total2 = swaps2 + color2
    print(min(total, total2))
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle cases where the initial arrangement already satisfies the alternating condition.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function reads an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of 'b' and 'r', where 'b' denotes black cockroaches and 'r' denotes red cockroaches. It then counts the number of black and red cockroaches in positions that should ideally be the opposite color based on their index (even-indexed positions should be 'b' and odd-indexed positions should be 'r'). The function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to have as many cockroaches in their correctly positioned color as possible. Specifically, it performs two passes over the string to count mismatches in even and odd indexed positions, calculates the number of swaps needed for each pass, and prints the minimum of these two values. This ensures that the function provides the optimal solution for the given input, considering all edge cases such as strings composed entirely of one color, alternating colors, or mixed distributions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
