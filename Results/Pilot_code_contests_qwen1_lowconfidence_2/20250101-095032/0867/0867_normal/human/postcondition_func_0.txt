The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a modified version of `x`. Specifically, it applies a series of bitwise operations and bit shifts to `x`. The final value returned is \((x \& 79228162495817593524129366015) + (x >> 16 \& 79228162495817593524129366015)\). This involves multiple bitwise AND operations (`&`) and right shifts (`>>`), where each operation progressively masks and modifies the bits of `x` before combining them back together.
