According to the provided code and the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration, we need to analyze the current state and determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Here are the key points from the postcondition:
- `i` is currently 1.
- `na` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an integer.
- `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`.
- If `y > 0`, `cnt` is increased by the value of `func_1(a[1] << y & b[1 + x])`.
- Otherwise, `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` must be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
2. The condition `(i + x)` being within the range of 0 to `nb-1` still needs to hold true.
3. Since the range check and the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `y` are based on the current values of `i` and `x`, these conditions should remain valid as long as `i` is within the range 0 to `na-1`.

Given that `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2. We need to ensure that `i = 2` is still within the valid range, and the other conditions related to `x`, `y`, and the arrays `a` and `b` should remain unchanged as they depend on the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, and `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`. If `y > 0`, `cnt` is increased by the value of `func_1(a[2] << y & b[2 + x])`. Otherwise, `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[2] & b[2 + x] << -y)`**.
