The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `cnt` is now 0.

Output State: **na and ma are positive integers such that 1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50, a is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the first table consisting of '0' and '1', nb and mb are positive integers such that 1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50, b is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the second table consisting of '0' and '1', x and y are integers representing a shift of the second table relative to the first one, and cnt is 0.**
