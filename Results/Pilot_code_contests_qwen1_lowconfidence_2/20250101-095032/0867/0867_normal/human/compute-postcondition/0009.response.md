Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `na` must be greater than 0
   - `x` is an integer
   - `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`
   - If `y > 0`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`.
   - Otherwise, `cnt` is incremented by `func_1(a[0] & b[0 + x] << -y)`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, na):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `na-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1.
   - The condition `(i + x)` must still be within the range of 0 to `nb-1`.
   - The value of `na` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` was 0 and we need it to be 1, `i` will now be 1.
   - The condition `na > 0` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `x` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - The range condition `(i + x)` must still hold true.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 1, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, and `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`**
