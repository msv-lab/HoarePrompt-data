Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `na - 1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `na`.

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `na`: The number of rows in the first table (`a`).
   - `i`: The loop variable, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `na`.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `na` and `ma` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq na, ma \leq 50\).
   - `a` is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the first table consisting of '0' and '1'.
   - `nb` and `mb` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq nb, mb \leq 50\).
   - `b` is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the second table consisting of '0' and '1'.
   - `x` and `y` are integers representing a shift of the second table relative to the first one.
   - `cnt` is 0.

4. **Execution of the Loop**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 0 and increment until it is less than `na`.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0, and the loop will continue as long as `i < na`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states for the loop to execute:
- `i` should be initialized to 0.
- `na` must be greater than 0 (since the loop runs from 0 to `na - 1`, `na` must be at least 1).

The other variables (`ma`, `nb`, `mb`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `cnt`) do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 0, `na` must be greater than 0**
