Let's analyze the loop step-by-step and determine the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `na` and `ma` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq na, ma \leq 50\).
- `a` is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the first table consisting of '0' and '1'.
- `nb` and `mb` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq nb, mb \leq 50\).
- `b` is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the second table consisting of '0' and '1'.
- `x` and `y` are integers representing a shift of the second table relative to the first one.
- `cnt` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(0, na):
    if i + x in range(0, nb):
        if y > 0:
            cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])
        else:
            cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute for each `i` from 0 to `na-1`.
   - For each `i`, the condition `i + x in range(0, nb)` must be true for the loop body to execute.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - If `y > 0`, then `cnt` is updated by `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`.
   - If `y <= 0`, then `cnt` is updated by `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `na - 1` (since the loop runs from 0 to `na-1`).
   - `na` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` will be the sum of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` or `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all valid `i`.

4. **State After All Iterations**:
   - The loop will run through all valid `i` values where `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`.
   - `cnt` will be the cumulative result of `func_1` applied to the bitwise operations described above for all valid `i`.

### Final Output State:
- `i` will be `na - 1` (assuming the loop ran through all valid `i` values).
- `na` must be a positive integer.
- `x` is an integer.
- `y` is an integer.
- `cnt` will be the cumulative result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` or `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all valid `i`.

### Conclusion:
If the loop does not execute, it means no valid `i` was found such that `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`. In this case, `cnt` will still be 0.

### Output State:
Output State: **`i` is `na - 1`, `na` must be a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `cnt` is the cumulative result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` or `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all valid `i` where `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`. If no valid `i` exists, `cnt` is 0.**
