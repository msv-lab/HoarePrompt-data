The code updates the value of `cnt` by adding the result of the function call `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`. However, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are not specified in the initial state, and there is no information about the function `func_1`. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `cnt` in terms of these unspecified values.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, and `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`; `cnt` is increased by the value of `func_1(a[1] << y & b[1 + x])`**
