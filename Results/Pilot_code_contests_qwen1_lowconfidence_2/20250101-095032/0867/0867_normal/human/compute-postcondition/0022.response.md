Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns an integer `cnt`. It iterates over the rows of a 2D list `a` and a shifted version of a 2D list `b` (shifted by `x` rows), performing bitwise operations (`<<` for left shift and `&` for bitwise AND) based on the value of `y`. For each valid pair of rows (where `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`), it calls the function `func_1` on the result of these operations and accumulates the results in `cnt`. If no valid pairs exist, `cnt` remains 0. Potential edge cases include when `x` causes `i + x` to go out of bounds for list `b`. In such cases, those iterations do not contribute to `cnt`.**

This summary covers all aspects of the function's behavior as defined by the code, including handling edge cases where the shift parameter `x` might cause indices to be out of bounds.
