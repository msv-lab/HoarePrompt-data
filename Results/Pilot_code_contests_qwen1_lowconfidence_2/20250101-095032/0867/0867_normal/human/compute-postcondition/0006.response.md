`cnt` is incremented by the result of the function call `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`. The values of `a[i]`, `b[i + x]`, and `-y` affect the result of the bitwise operations. However, since the exact values of these variables are not specified, we can only express the result in terms of them.

Given the conditions:
- `i` is 0
- `na` must be greater than 0
- `x` is an integer
- `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`
- `y` is less than or equal to 0

The updated state is:
- `cnt` is incremented by `func_1(a[0] & b[0 + x] << -y)`

Output State: **`i` is 0, `na` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, and `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`; `y` is less than or equal to 0; `cnt` is incremented by `func_1(a[0] & b[0 + x] << -y)`**
