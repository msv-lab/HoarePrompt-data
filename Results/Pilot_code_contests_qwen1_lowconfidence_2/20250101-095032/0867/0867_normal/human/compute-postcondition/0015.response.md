The code updates the variable `cnt` by adding the value of the function `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `na` must be greater than 0 (though `na` is not used in this code)
- `x` is an integer
- `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])
```

Given that `i` is 2, this simplifies to:
```python
cnt += func_1(a[2] << y & b[2 + x])
```

Since `x` is an integer and `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`, it implies that `2 + x` is within the valid index range for the list `b`.

Therefore, the value of `cnt` is updated by the result of `func_1(a[2] << y & b[2 + x])`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `(i + x)` is within the range of 0 to `nb-1`, `na` must be greater than 0, and `cnt` is increased by `func_1(a[2] << y & b[2 + x])`.**
