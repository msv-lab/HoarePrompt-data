Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the case when shifting the second table causes it to go out of bounds for the first table. 

According to the problem description, the valid range for the shift `x` is from `1-na` to `nb-1` and for `y` is from `1-ma` to `mb-1`. However, the code only checks if `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`, but it does not check if `j + y` is within the range `[0, mb-1]`. 

This oversight means that if the shift `y` is large enough to cause any column of the second table to go out of bounds of the first table, the code will incorrectly compute the overlap factor. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
na = 3, ma = 2
a = ["01", "10", "00"]
nb = 3, mb = 2
b = ["001", "111"]
```

If we shift the second table by `(x=0, y=2)`, the code would attempt to access `a[i][j+2]` for some `i` and `j`, which would be out of bounds because `j+2` could exceed the length of the rows in `a`.

To fix this, the code needs to add a check to ensure that `j + y` is within the valid range `[0, mb-1]` for each valid pair of rows `(i, i+x)` where `i + x` is within `[0, nb-1]`.
