You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got two rectangular tables with sizes na × ma and nb × mb cells. The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as ai, j; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as bi, j. 

We will call the pair of integers (x, y) a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift (x, y) value:

<image>

where the variables i, j take only such values, in which the expression ai, j·bi + x, j + y makes sense. More formally, inequalities 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb must hold. If there are no values of variables i, j, that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0. 

Your task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers na, ma (1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then na lines contain ma characters each — the elements of the first table. Each character is either a "0", or a "1".

The next line contains two space-separated integers nb, mb (1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the second table. Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.

It is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number "1". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number "1".

Output

Print two space-separated integers x, y (|x|, |y| ≤ 109) — a shift with maximum overlap factor. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly calculate the overlap factor as defined in the problem description. The function `func_1` seems to be performing some bitwise operations, but these operations are not related to calculating the overlap factor between the two tables. Additionally, `func_2` does not correctly iterate over the elements of the tables to compute the overlap factor for different shifts.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate over all possible shifts (x, y).
2. For each shift, calculate the overlap factor using the formula provided in the problem description.
3. Keep track of the shift with the maximum overlap factor.
4. Output the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
