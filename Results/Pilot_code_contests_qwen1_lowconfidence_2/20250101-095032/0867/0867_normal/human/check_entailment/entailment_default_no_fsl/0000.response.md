Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the shifting of the second table relative to the first table. The function `func_2` attempts to perform this shift, but it does not correctly account for the boundaries of the second table. The inner loop of `func_2` iterates over the rows of `a` and a shifted version of `b`, but it does not correctly check the boundaries of `b` to ensure that the indices `i + x` and `j + y` are within the valid range of `b`.

Here is a more detailed explanation:

1. The function `func_2` should check if `i + x` is within the valid range `[0, nb-1]` for the second table `b`.
2. Similarly, the function should check if `j + y` is within the valid range `[0, mb-1]` for the second table `b`.
3. The current implementation of `func_2` does not account for these boundary checks, which means it may attempt to access invalid indices of `b`, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if `na = 3`, `ma = 2`, `nb = 2`, and `mb = 3`, and the tables are as follows:

First table (a):
```
01
10
00
```

Second table (b):
```
001
111
```

If `x = 1` and `y = 0`, the function `func_2` should not attempt to access `b[3][j]` because `3` is out of bounds for `b`. However, the current implementation does not enforce this boundary check, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the inner loop in `func_2` should include boundary checks for both `i + x` and `j + y`:

```python
def func_2(x, y):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(na):
        for j in range(ma):
            if 0 <= i + x < nb and 0 <= j + y < mb:
                if y > 0:
                    cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x][j + y])
                else:
                    cnt += func_1(a[i][j + y] & b[i + x])
    return cnt
```

By adding these boundary checks, the code will correctly handle the shifting of the second table relative to the first table, ensuring that the program works correctly for every potential case.
