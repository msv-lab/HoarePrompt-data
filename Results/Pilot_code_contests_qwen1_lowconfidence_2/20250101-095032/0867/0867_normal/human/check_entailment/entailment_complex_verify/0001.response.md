Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1`:** The purpose of `func_1` is unclear and does not relate to calculating the overlap factor. The series of bitwise operations performed in `func_1` do not align with the problem's requirements. The function is likely intended to perform some form of hashing or transformation, but it does not contribute to computing the overlap factor.

2. **Function `func_2`:** While `func_2` attempts to iterate over the elements of the tables to compute the overlap factor, it does so in a way that is inconsistent with the problem description. The code shifts rows of the tables incorrectly and does not properly account for the bitwise AND operations needed to compute the overlap factor. For example, the shifting and masking operations used in `func_2` are not aligned with the formula provided in the problem description.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
