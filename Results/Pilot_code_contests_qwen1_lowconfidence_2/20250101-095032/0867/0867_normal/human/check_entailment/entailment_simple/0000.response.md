Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input as binary numbers using bitwise operations (`int(stdin.readline().strip()[::-1], 2)`). This is not aligned with the problem description, which states that the input consists of rows of '0's and '1's. The bitwise operations are not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Overlap Factor:**
   - The function `func_2(x, y)` calculates the overlap factor, but it uses bitwise operations and bit shifting in a way that does not align with the problem description. Specifically, it uses bit shifting and bitwise AND operations (`a[i] << y & b[i + x]` and `a[i] & b[i + x] << -y`) which are not mentioned in the problem description. These operations do not correctly compute the sum of products as required by the problem.

3. **Shift Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to find the shift `(x, y)` that maximizes the overlap factor. However, the logic inside `func_2(x, y)` is flawed because it does not correctly compute the overlap factor according to the problem description. The problem requires computing the sum of `ai,j * bi+x,j+y`, which should be done directly without bitwise operations.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct, printing two space-separated integers `(xx, yy)` representing the shift with the maximum overlap factor. However, this is only relevant if the preceding computations are correct.

To meet the problem description, the program should:
- Directly parse the input as strings of '0's and '1's.
- Use nested loops to iterate over possible shifts `(x, y)`.
- Compute the overlap factor by iterating over valid indices and summing the products `ai,j * bi+x,j+y`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that adheres to the problem description:

```python
from sys import stdin

def parse_table(lines):
    return [[int(c) for c in line.strip()] for line in lines]

# Read dimensions and tables
na, ma = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
a = parse_table([stdin.readline() for _ in range(na)])
nb, mb = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
b = parse_table([stdin.readline() for _ in range(nb)])

# Initialize the best shift and its overlap factor
best_x, best_y, best_overlap = 0, 0, 0

# Iterate over possible shifts
for x in range(1 - na, nb):
    for y in range(1 - ma, mb):
        overlap = 0
        for i in range(na):
            for j in range(ma):
                if 1 <= i + x <= nb and 1 <= j + y <= mb:
                    overlap += a[i][j] * b[i + x - 1][j + y - 1]
        if overlap > best_overlap:
            best_x, best_y, best_overlap = x, y, overlap

print(f'{best_x} {best_y}')
```

This version correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, ensuring that the overlap factor is computed correctly and that the program outputs the correct shift.
