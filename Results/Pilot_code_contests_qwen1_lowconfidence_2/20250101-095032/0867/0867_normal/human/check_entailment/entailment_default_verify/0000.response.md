Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the program does not correctly implement the solution. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not align with the required logic to calculate the overlap factor for shifts between the two tables. Specifically, `func_2` seems to perform bitwise operations that do not reflect the intended computation of the overlap factor, as defined in the problem statement. The output hints suggest that `func_2` iterates over the rows of the tables and performs bitwise operations, but these operations do not match the described calculation of the overlap factor. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
