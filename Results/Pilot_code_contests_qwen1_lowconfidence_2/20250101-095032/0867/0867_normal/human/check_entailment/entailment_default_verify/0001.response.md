Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform the necessary operations to calculate the overlap factor between the two tables for different shifts. The bitwise operations in `func_1` are unrelated to the problem requirements, and `func_2` does not correctly iterate over the elements of the tables to compute the overlap factor. The output hints confirm that `func_2` only performs bitwise operations and does not handle the calculation of the overlap factor as defined in the problem description. Therefore, the program cannot produce the correct output for any input.
