Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to relate to the task of calculating the overlap factor between the two tables. Instead, they appear to be performing bitwise operations that do not align with the problem description.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, let's consider a simple example:

### Example:
**Input:**
```
na, ma = 2, 2
a = [
    '01',
    '10'
]
nb, mb = 2, 2
b = [
    '00',
    '01'
]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program does not produce any output because it does not implement the logic to calculate the overlap factor for all possible shifts. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Hence, the correctness of the program is **False**.
