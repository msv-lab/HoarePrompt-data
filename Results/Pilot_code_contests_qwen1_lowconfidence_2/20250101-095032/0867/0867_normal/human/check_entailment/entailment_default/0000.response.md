Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly calculate the overlap factor for the given shifts.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` performs a series of bitwise operations that do not directly relate to calculating the overlap factor as described in the problem. The problem requires counting the number of matching elements between corresponding rows after a shift, but `func_1` simply transforms an integer value without any relation to the overlap factor calculation.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the overlap factor by shifting bits and calling `func_1`, but it does not correctly perform the required bitwise operations to count matching elements.
   - The problem requires checking elements \(a[i][j] \cdot b[i+x][j+y]\) for valid ranges, but the function `func_2` does not properly handle the bitwise operations to achieve this.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required logic to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor. Therefore, the code is incorrect for at least some potential cases.
