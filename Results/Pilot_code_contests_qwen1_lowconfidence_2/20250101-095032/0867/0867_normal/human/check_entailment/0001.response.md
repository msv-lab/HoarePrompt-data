Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly calculate the overlap factor as defined in the problem description. The function `func_1` seems to be performing some bitwise operations, but these operations are not related to calculating the overlap factor between the two tables. Additionally, `func_2` does not correctly iterate over the elements of the tables to compute the overlap factor for different shifts.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate over all possible shifts (x, y).
2. For each shift, calculate the overlap factor using the formula provided in the problem description.
3. Keep track of the shift with the maximum overlap factor.
4. Output the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it is incorrect.
