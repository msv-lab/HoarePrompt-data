na and ma are positive integers such that 1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50, a is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the first table consisting of '0' and '1', nb and mb are positive integers such that 1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50, b is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the second table consisting of '0' and '1', x and y are integers representing a shift of the second table relative to the first one, and func_1 is a function that returns an integer based on the bitwise operations performed on the elements of the tables.
