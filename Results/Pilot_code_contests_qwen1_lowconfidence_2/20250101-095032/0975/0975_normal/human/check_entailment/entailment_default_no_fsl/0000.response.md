Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the social network is reasonable according to the problem description. Specifically, the code checks if every vertex in the graph has the same number of neighbors, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the network to be reasonable. This approach fails to check the transitive property required for the network to be reasonable, i.e., if A and B are friends, and B and C are friends, then A and C must also be friends.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4
```

This input satisfies the condition for a reasonable network because if 1 and 3 are friends, and 3 and 4 are friends, then 1 and 4 must also be friends, which is the case here. Therefore, the output should be "YES". However, the code would incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks if all vertices have the same number of neighbors, which is not a sufficient condition for the network to be reasonable.

A correct implementation would involve checking all possible triplets of members to ensure that if members A and B are friends and members B and C are friends, then members A and C must also be friends.
