You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).

There are n members, numbered 1 through n. m pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print "YES" or "NO" accordingly, without the quotes.

Input

The first line of the input contain two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, <image>) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two distinct integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). Members ai and bi are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.

Output

If the given network is reasonable, print "YES" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" in a single line (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4


Output

YES


Input

4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2


Output

NO


Input

10 4
4 3
5 10
8 9
1 2


Output

YES


Input

3 2
1 2
2 3


Output

NO

Note

The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is "NO" in the second sample because members (2, 3) are friends and members (3, 4) are friends, while members (2, 4) are not.

    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):

    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    leftToCheck = set([i + 1 for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
    if isGood:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to check if the network is reasonable. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of connections, which is not sufficient to verify the transitive property required for the network to be reasonable.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2
```

In this case, members 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle (each pair is friends), but member 4 is only friends with member 3. According to the problem description, since 1-3 and 3-4, member 1 should also be friends with member 4. However, the current implementation does not detect this issue because it does not explicitly check the transitive property.

The program should instead use a different approach to verify the transitivity of friendships, such as using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to check if there is a direct friendship between all pairs of connected nodes. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def is_reasonable(n, edges):
    # Create adjacency list
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_list[u].append(v)
        adj_list[v].append(u)
    
    # Helper function to perform DFS
    def dfs(node, visited, parent):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                if dfs(neighbor, visited, node):
                    return True
            elif neighbor != parent:
                return True
        return False
    
    # Check for any transitive violations
    for u, v in edges:
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        if dfs(u, visited, None):
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

# Read input
(n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    edges.append((u, v))

# Determine if the network is reasonable
print(is_reasonable(n, edges))
```

This corrected program uses a DFS to check if there are any indirect friendships that violate the transitive property. If it finds any such violation, it returns "NO"; otherwise, it returns "YES".

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and another integer `m` from standard input, representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph respectively. It then constructs an undirected graph using these inputs. After constructing the graph, the function checks whether every vertex has the same number of neighbors (i.e., whether the graph is a clique). If all vertices have the same number of neighbors, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the graph is a clique; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it may raise an error if the input values are out of the specified ranges or if the graph construction fails due to malformed input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
