Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code checks whether the graph is a clique, meaning every vertex has the same number of neighbors. However, the problem requires checking if for every three distinct members \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\), if \(X-Y\) and \(Y-Z\) then also \(X-Z\). 

The code does not properly check for transitivity among all triplets of members. Instead, it checks if all vertices in the graph have the same degree (number of neighbors), which is not equivalent to the transitive property required by the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
4 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

The code would incorrectly output "YES" because all vertices have the same degree (3), even though the network is not transitive. However, the correct output should be "NO" because \(1-2\) and \(2-3\) but \(1-3\) is not a direct friendship.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
