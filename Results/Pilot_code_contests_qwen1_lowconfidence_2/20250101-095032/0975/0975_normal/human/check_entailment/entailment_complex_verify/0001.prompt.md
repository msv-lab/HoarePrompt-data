You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).

There are n members, numbered 1 through n. m pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print "YES" or "NO" accordingly, without the quotes.

Input

The first line of the input contain two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, <image>) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two distinct integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). Members ai and bi are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.

Output

If the given network is reasonable, print "YES" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" in a single line (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4


Output

YES


Input

4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2


Output

NO


Input

10 4
4 3
5 10
8 9
1 2


Output

YES


Input

3 2
1 2
2 3


Output

NO

Note

The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is "NO" in the second sample because members (2, 3) are friends and members (3, 4) are friends, while members (2, 4) are not.

Program:

from sys import stdin, stdout

    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i + 1] = []
    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    leftToCheck = set([i + 1 for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
    if isGood:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the network is reasonable. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of edges, which is not sufficient to ensure the transitive property holds for all triplets (X, Y, Z). 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2
```

In this case, nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle (1-2, 2-3, and 3-1), but the program will incorrectly mark this as "YES" because all neighbors of node 3 have the same number of edges (2). However, the correct output should be "NO" since the transitive property is not satisfied (1-2 and 2-3 but not 1-3).

The program needs to explicitly check the transitivity condition for every triplet of nodes, which is not implemented in the given code.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2, and the following pairs (ai, bi) are unique, where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i + 1] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is \(n\), `graph` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `n` and each key maps to an empty list.
    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge.
    leftToCheck = set([(i + 1) for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is undefined, `neighbors` is an empty list, and `cliqueSize` is 0.
    if isGood :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`), `checkMe` is undefined, `neighbors` is an empty list, and `cliqueSize` is 0. If `isGood` is `True`, the console outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, the console outputs 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and another integer `m` from standard input, representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph respectively. It then constructs an undirected graph using these inputs. After constructing the graph, the function checks whether every vertex has the same number of neighbors (i.e., whether the graph is a clique). If all vertices have the same number of neighbors, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the graph is a clique; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it may raise an error if the input values are out of the specified ranges or if the graph construction fails due to malformed input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
