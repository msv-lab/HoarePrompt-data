Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the network is reasonable based on the given problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Implementation of the Reasonability Condition**: 
   - The problem requires checking whether for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z, then X-Z must hold true.
   - The current implementation does not check this condition. Instead, it attempts to verify something different by checking if all neighbors of a node have the same number of connections, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement.

2. **Logic Error in the While Loop**:
   - The while loop iterates over nodes in `leftToCheck` and checks the size of their neighbors' sets.
   - This approach does not ensure that for every pair of friends (X, Y), X and Y are both friends with every common friend Z, which is the core condition to be verified.

3. **Incorrect State Management**:
   - The state management within the while loop and subsequent discarding of nodes is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the program does not maintain a proper set of triples to check the transitivity condition (X-Y and Y-Z implies X-Z).

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Build the graph from the input.
- Use a transitive closure algorithm or a direct check to verify the transitivity condition for all triplets of nodes.

Here’s a high-level outline of how the correct solution might look:
1. Build the graph.
2. For every triplet of nodes (X, Y, Z), check if X is friends with Z whenever X is friends with Y and Y is friends with Z.
3. If any triplet violates the condition, output "NO".
4. If all triplets satisfy the condition, output "YES".

Given these points, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem and thus is **False**.
