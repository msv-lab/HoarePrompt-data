Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the network is reasonable. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of edges, which is not sufficient to ensure the transitive property holds for all triplets (X, Y, Z). 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2
```

In this case, nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle (1-2, 2-3, and 3-1), but the program will incorrectly mark this as "YES" because all neighbors of node 3 have the same number of edges (2). However, the correct output should be "NO" since the transitive property is not satisfied (1-2 and 2-3 but not 1-3).

The program needs to explicitly check the transitivity condition for every triplet of nodes, which is not implemented in the given code.
