Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if the network is reasonable according to the problem description. The problem requires checking if for every three distinct members \(X, Y, Z\), if \(X\) is friends with \(Y\) and \(Y\) is friends with \(Z\), then \(X\) must also be friends with \(Z\). This condition needs to be verified for all possible triplets of members.

However, the current implementation does not check for the transitive closure property among all members. Instead, it checks if every vertex in the graph has the same number of neighbors, which is not equivalent to the required condition. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Check Logic**: 
   - The program checks if every vertex has the same number of neighbors (clique property). While a clique satisfies the transitive property, not all networks that satisfy the transitive property are cliques.
   - For example, consider the network with members 1, 2, 3, and 4 where the edges are (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4). This network is transitive (if 1 is friends with 2 and 2 is friends with 3, then 1 should be friends with 3), but it is not a clique (1 is not friends with 4, 2 is not friends with 4, etc.).

2. **Missing Transitive Property Verification**:
   - The program should iterate over all possible triplets \((X, Y, Z)\) and check if \(X\) is friends with \(Z\) whenever \(X\) is friends with \(Y\) and \(Y\) is friends with \(Z\).
   - This involves a nested loop structure to generate all triplets and verify the transitive property.

Hereâ€™s a corrected approach to implement the solution:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n+1)}
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    for X, Y in combinations(graph.keys(), 2):
        if Y in graph[X]:
            for Z in graph[Y]:
                if Z != X and Z not in graph[X]:
                    print('NO')
                    return
    print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Implementation:
1. **Graph Construction**: Construct the graph using adjacency lists.
2. **Triplets Generation**: Use `combinations` from the `itertools` module to generate all possible pairs of members.
3. **Transitive Property Check**: For each pair \((X, Y)\) where \(X\) and \(Y\) are friends, check if all friends of \(Y\) are also friends of \(X\). If any such triplet violates the transitive property, print 'NO' and return immediately.
4. **Final Output**: If no violations are found, print 'YES'.

This ensures the program correctly checks the transitive property for all possible triplets, making it adhere to the problem description.
