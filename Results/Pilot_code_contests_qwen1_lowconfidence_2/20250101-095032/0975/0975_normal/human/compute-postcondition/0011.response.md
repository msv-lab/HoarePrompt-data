The code `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` appends the value of `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`. Since `edge` is a map object containing integers, `edge[0]` and `edge[1]` are integers. However, the exact values of these integers are not specified in the initial state, only that `i` is `n` and `m` must be at least `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `i` is `n`
- `m` must be at least `n`
- `graph[edge[0]]` now contains `edge[1]` appended to it

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` must be at least `n`, `graph[edge[0]]` contains `edge[1]` appended to it**
