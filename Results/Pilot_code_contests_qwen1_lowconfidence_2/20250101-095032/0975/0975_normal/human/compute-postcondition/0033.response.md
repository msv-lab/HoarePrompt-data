Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set(), `isGood` is `False` if `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, and `True` otherwise, `checkMe` is the popped element from `leftToCheck` (and `checkMe` must have at least one neighbor), `neighbors` is a non-empty list of all vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, and `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or block of code if `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.***
