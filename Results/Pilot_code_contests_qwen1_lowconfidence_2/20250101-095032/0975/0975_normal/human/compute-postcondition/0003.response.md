`graph` is a list, and at index `i + 1`, an empty list is assigned. The value of `i` is 0, so `graph[1]` is set to an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 0; `graph[1]` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 0; `graph[1]` is an empty list**
