Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of the current `checkMe`; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the next element in `neighbors` and has at least one neighbor in `graph` whose list length is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element. If `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Otherwise, `leftToCheck` remains unchanged.***
