The code sets `isGood` to `False`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` has at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; for all `neighbor` in `neighbors`, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` has at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; for all `neighbor` in `neighbors`, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`**.
