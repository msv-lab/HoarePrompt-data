The code reads two integers from the standard input and splits them into a tuple, which is then assigned to `edge`. However, the actual values of these integers are not specified in the initial state. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged because no operation is performed on them within the given code snippet. The `graph` dictionary and its contents also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `m` is at least `n + 1`, `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]`, `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`, `edge` is a tuple containing two integers read from stdin**
