The code appends `edge[0]` to the list `graph[edge[1]]`. Initially, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least `n + 1`, and `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]` in its list. After executing the code, `graph[edge[1]]` will include both `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` is at least `n + 1`, `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]`, `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0] and `edge[1]`**
