The code `leftToCheck = set([])` assigns an empty set to the variable `leftToCheck`. The initial state of `leftToCheck` is either a non-empty set or becomes an empty set depending on the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`. Since the code explicitly sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set, this overrides the initial condition and ensures `leftToCheck` is now an empty set.

The states of the other variables (`graph`, `cliqueSize`, and `isGood`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.**
