Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial value:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The initial value of `i` is `n`.

2. **Determine the range of the loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(m)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Check the condition for loop execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[0, m-1]`.
   - Given that `i` is initialized to `n`, and `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), we need to ensure that `m` is at least as large as `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider the graph dictionary:**
   - The graph is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `n` and each key maps to an empty list.
   - This information is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but ensures the structure of the graph is correctly set up.

5. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and the loop runs for `m` iterations, we need `m` to be at least `n` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `m` to be at least `n`.

**Final State:**
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
- `i` is `n`.
- `m` must be at least `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is `n`, `m` must be at least `n`**
