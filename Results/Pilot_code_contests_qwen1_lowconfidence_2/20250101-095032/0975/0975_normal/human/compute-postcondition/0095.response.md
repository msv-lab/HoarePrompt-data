Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`), `checkMe` is undefined, `neighbors` is an empty list, and `cliqueSize` is 0. If `isGood` is `True`, the console outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, the console outputs 'NO'.***
