The code `leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))` attempts to remove the set of `neighbors` from the `leftToCheck` set if it exists. However, since `leftToCheck` is initially an empty set, the discard operation will not affect it. No other variables are impacted by this code.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of the last processed `checkMe`; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; `checkMe` is not defined since no further checks are needed; `neighbors` is not defined since no further checks are needed; the discard operation does not change the state of `leftToCheck` which remains an empty set.**
