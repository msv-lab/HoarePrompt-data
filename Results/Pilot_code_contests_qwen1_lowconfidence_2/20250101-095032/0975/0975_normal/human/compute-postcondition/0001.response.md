The code initializes an empty dictionary named `graph`. This means that `graph` will be an empty dictionary, and the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated state of `graph` and retain the initial states of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000; `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2; `graph` is an empty dictionary {}**
