The code creates a set named `leftToCheck` which contains the integers from `i + 1` to `n`. Since `i` is initially equal to `m`, the set `leftToCheck` will contain all integers starting from `m + 1` up to `n`.

Given this, the Output State is:

**`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m + 1` to `n`.**
