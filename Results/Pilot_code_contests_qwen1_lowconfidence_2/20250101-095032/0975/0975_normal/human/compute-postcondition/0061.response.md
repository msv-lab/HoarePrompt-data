Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers.
   - `cliqueSize` is an integer.
   - `isGood` remains `False`.
   - `leftToCheck` is either a non-empty set or becomes an empty set depending on the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for neighbor in neighbors:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in the `neighbors` collection.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are neighbors left to check in `leftToCheck`.
   - If `len(graph[neighbor]) == cliqueSize`, then `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set and the loop stops.
   - If `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`, then `leftToCheck` remains a non-empty set.

5. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is about to execute the next iteration, `isGood` remains `False`.
   - `cliqueSize` stays the same.
   - `leftToCheck` could either be a non-empty set or an empty set depending on the condition in the loop body.
   - `graph` remains unchanged.

Given these points, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since we don't know the exact value of `leftToCheck` from the previous iteration, we consider both possibilities:

- If `leftToCheck` was non-empty and the current `neighbor` does not satisfy the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`, then `leftToCheck` would become empty.
- If `leftToCheck` was non-empty and the current `neighbor` satisfies the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`, then `leftToCheck` would remain non-empty.

However, without knowing the exact condition result from the previous iteration, we can only generalize the possible states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains False; `leftToCheck` is either a non-empty set or becomes an empty set depending on the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`**.

Since we don't have specific information about the `leftToCheck` set from the previous iteration, the most accurate representation is to keep it as a variable that can change based on the loop condition.
