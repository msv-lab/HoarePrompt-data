The code initializes `leftToCheck` to an empty set, which means it removes all elements from the previously existing set. Since `leftToCheck` was initially a set containing integers from `m + 1` to `n` except for the popped element, after this line, `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set(), `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the popped element from `leftToCheck` (and `checkMe` must have at least one neighbor), `neighbors` is a non-empty list of all vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`. The length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize` for at least one `neighbor` in `neighbors`.**
