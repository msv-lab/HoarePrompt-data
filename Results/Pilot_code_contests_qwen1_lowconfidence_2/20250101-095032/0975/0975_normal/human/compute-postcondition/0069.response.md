`leftToCheck` pops an element, which assigns it to `checkMe`. The value of `leftToCheck` changes because an element is removed from it. The value of `isGood` remains unchanged as no assignment to it occurs. The value of `graph` remains unchanged as no operation affects it. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is at least one element less than before, and `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`.**
