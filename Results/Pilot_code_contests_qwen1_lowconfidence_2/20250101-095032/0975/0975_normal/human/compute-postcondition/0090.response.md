Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is undefined, `neighbors` is an empty list, and `cliqueSize` is 0.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues to process elements in `leftToCheck` until it is empty. Each iteration of the loop pops an element from `leftToCheck`, checks its neighbors, and updates `isGood` and `leftToCheck` accordingly.
- If during any iteration, `isGood` is set to `False` due to a mismatch in the size of neighbors, the loop terminates immediately and `leftToCheck` is set to an empty set. Since `leftToCheck` is emptied, no further elements are checked.
- The loop will eventually exhaust all elements in `leftToCheck`. Given the nature of the operations within the loop, if the loop completes without setting `isGood` to `False`, `isGood` will still be `False` because the condition to set it to `True` (all vertices having the same number of neighbors) was never met.
- After the loop finishes, `leftToCheck` will be empty, `isGood` will be `False`, and other variables like `checkMe`, `neighbors`, and `cliqueSize` will be undefined or in a state reflecting the final iteration of the loop.
