`graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` appends `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`. The initial state tells us that `graph[edge[0]]` already includes `edge[1]`, but this operation adds `edge[1]` again, meaning `edge[1]` will now appear twice in `graph[edge[0]]`.

The other variables (`i`, `m`, and `edge`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `m` is at least `n + 1`, `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]` (appears twice), `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`, `edge` is a tuple containing two integers read from stdin**
