Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers.
   - `cliqueSize` is an integer.
   - `isGood` remains False.
   - `leftToCheck` is a set([]).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for neighbor in neighbors:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in the `neighbors` collection.
   - For each `neighbor`, the loop body is executed.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are more `neighbors` left to iterate over.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `graph`: This dictionary remains unchanged within the loop unless modified by the loop body.
   - `cliqueSize`: This integer remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `isGood`: This boolean remains False as per the given information and there is no indication that it changes within the loop body.
   - `leftToCheck`: This set should be reduced by one element for each iteration because we check one neighbor per iteration.

Given these points, for the loop to execute one more time, `leftToCheck` must have at least one more element to check. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains False; `leftToCheck` is a set with at least one element**.
