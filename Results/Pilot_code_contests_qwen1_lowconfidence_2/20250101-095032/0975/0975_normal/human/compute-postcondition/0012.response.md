The code appends `edge[0]` to `graph[edge[1]]`. Before the code execution, `graph[edge[0]]` contains `edge[1]` appended to it. Since the code does not modify `i` or `m`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `m` must be at least `n`, `graph[edge[0]]` contains `edge[1]` appended to it, `graph[edge[1]]` now contains `edge[0]` appended to it.**
