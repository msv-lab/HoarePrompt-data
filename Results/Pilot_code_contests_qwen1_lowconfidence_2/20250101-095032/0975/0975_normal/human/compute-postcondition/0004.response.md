According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be 1 (since 0 < 1 and 1 < n). Therefore, we adjust `i` to 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the loop condition does not involve modifying `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 1, `graph[1]` is an empty list**
