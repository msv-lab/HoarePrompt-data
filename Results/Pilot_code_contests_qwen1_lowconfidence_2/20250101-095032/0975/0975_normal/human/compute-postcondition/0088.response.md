Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of the last processed `checkMe`; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; `checkMe` is not defined since no further checks are needed; `neighbors` is not defined since no further checks are needed; for all `neighbor` in the `neighbors` list, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in the list of `neighbors` of `checkMe`.
- If any `neighbor` has a length of its corresponding list in `graph` that equals `cliqueSize`, the loop breaks out of the iteration and sets `isGood` to `False` and `leftToCheck` to an empty set.
- If the loop completes without finding any `neighbor` with a list length equal to `cliqueSize`, `isGood` remains `False`.
- Once the loop exits (either normally or due to a break), `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set, and further iterations are not required.
- Since the loop does not continue to process any further elements, `checkMe` and `neighbors` are no longer relevant and are not defined in the final state.
