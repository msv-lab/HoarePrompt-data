The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This affects the `leftToCheck` variable by changing its value to an empty set. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; `checkMe` is the element that was previously popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; for all `neighbor` in the updated `neighbors` list, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; `checkMe` is the element that was previously popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; for all `neighbor` in the updated `neighbors` list, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.**
