The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables. It only breaks out of the current loop or match statement. Since there is no loop or match statement currently active, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; the neighbor being checked has a list length in `graph` that is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is False; `leftToCheck` is a set([])**
