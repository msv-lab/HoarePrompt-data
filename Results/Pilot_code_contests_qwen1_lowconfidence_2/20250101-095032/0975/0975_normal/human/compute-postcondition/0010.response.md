The code `edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, splits the line into separate elements, and maps each element to an integer. However, since no specific input is provided, the value of `edge` is a map object containing integers, but their specific values cannot be determined without knowing the actual input.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `m`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is `n`, `m` must be at least `n`, `edge` is a map object containing integers**
