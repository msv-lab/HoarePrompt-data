The code assigns the value of the list of neighbors corresponding to `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` to the variable `neighbors`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph`.**
