The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code snippet, the only change is that we break out of whatever context this line of code was part of. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of the current `checkMe`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set (`set([])`); `checkMe` is the next element in `neighbors` and has at least one neighbor in `graph` whose list length is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
