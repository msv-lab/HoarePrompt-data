`checkMe` is assigned the value of `leftToCheck.pop()`. This removes an element from `leftToCheck` and assigns it to `checkMe`. The value of `leftToCheck` is now a set containing one less element than before, specifically the set that was `leftToCheck` minus the popped element.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m + 1` to `n` except for the popped element, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is the popped element from `leftToCheck`.**
