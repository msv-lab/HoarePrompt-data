The code snippet `edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual strings, and then maps each string to an integer, storing the result in the variable `edge`. 

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `i` and `m`, we only know their relationships: `i` is `n + 1` and `m` must be at least `n + 1`. After executing the code, `edge` will be a map object containing integers from the input line. However, without knowing the actual input, we cannot determine the exact values in the map.

The output state includes the updated value of `edge` and maintains the initial relationships for `i` and `m`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` must be at least `n + 1`, `edge` is a map of integers from the input line**
