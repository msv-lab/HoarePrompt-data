According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since the condition \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\) does not change within the loop, `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 2, `graph[1]` is an empty list, `graph[2]` is an empty list**
