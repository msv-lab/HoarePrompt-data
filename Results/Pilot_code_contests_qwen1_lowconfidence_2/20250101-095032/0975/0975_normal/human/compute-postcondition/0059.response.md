The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match statement. Since there is no loop or match statement in the given code, the `break` statement here is effectively a no-op (no operation) and does not change any of the existing states.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` is False; `leftToCheck` is an empty set**
