Postcondition: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains False; `leftToCheck` is a set([]). If the length of the list corresponding to `neighbor` in `graph` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, the conditions remain unchanged.**
