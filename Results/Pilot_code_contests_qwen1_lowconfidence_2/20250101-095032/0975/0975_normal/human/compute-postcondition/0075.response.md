The code `leftToCheck = set([])` sets the variable `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This impacts the variable `leftToCheck` by changing its value from a set with at least one element to an empty set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set (`set([])`); `checkMe` is the element that was previously popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; for all `neighbor` in `neighbors`, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.**
