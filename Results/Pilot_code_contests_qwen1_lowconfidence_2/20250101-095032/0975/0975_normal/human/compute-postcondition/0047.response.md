The code `checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the set `leftToCheck` and assigns it to the variable `checkMe`. The set `leftToCheck` was non-empty before this operation, so after executing this line, `checkMe` will hold the value of the last element in `leftToCheck`, and `leftToCheck` will become a set with one fewer element.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set with one fewer element, `isGood` is `False` or `True`, `checkMe` is the last element popped from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is an empty list, and `cliqueSize` is 0.**
