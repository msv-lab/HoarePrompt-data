The code assigns the value of `graph[checkMe]` to the variable `neighbors`. This means that `neighbors` now contains the list of vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set with one fewer element, `isGood` is `False` or `True`, `checkMe` is the last element popped from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, and `cliqueSize` is 0.**
