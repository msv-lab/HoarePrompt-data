Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge.** 

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
  - `i` is initially set to `n`.
  - `graph` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `n`, and each key maps to an empty list.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop runs for `m` iterations.
  - In each iteration, the loop reads an edge from standard input and appends the second vertex to the list of the first vertex in the `graph` dictionary and vice versa.
  
- **Final State After All Iterations**:
  - After the loop completes all `m` iterations, `i` will be equal to `m` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
  - `m` will be the total number of edges in the graph since it determines the number of times the loop runs.
  - For each edge `(a, b)` read from the input, both `graph[a]` and `graph[b]` will contain each other. This means that if there is an edge between vertex `a` and vertex `b`, both `graph[a]` and `graph[b]` will include the other vertex.

Thus, after all iterations, the final state of the variables will reflect the complete graph representation as described above.
