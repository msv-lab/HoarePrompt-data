According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop condition `i < m` must be satisfied for the loop to continue. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and `m` must be at least `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n + 1`. Additionally, `m` must still be at least `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` must be at least `n + 1`**
