Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; for all `neighbor` in `neighbors`, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`. If the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize` holds for all `neighbor` in `neighbors`, `isGood` remains `False`. Otherwise, the condition continues to be checked for the next iteration or element in `leftToCheck`.***
