The code `leftToCheck = set([])` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `leftToCheck`. This changes the value of `leftToCheck` from "at least one element less than before" to an empty set. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of the current `checkMe`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set (`set([])`); `checkMe` is the next element in `neighbors` and has at least one neighbor in `graph` whose list length is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element.**
