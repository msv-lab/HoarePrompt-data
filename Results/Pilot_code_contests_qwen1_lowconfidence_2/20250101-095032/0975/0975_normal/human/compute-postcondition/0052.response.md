The variable `isGood` is assigned the value `False`. No other changes are made to the variables. The precondition that the neighbor being checked has a list length in `graph` that is not equal to `cliqueSize` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; the neighbor being checked has a list length in `graph` that is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is False**
