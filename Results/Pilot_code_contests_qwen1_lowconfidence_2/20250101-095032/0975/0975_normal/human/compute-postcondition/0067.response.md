The code `leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))` attempts to remove the set of `neighbors` from the `leftToCheck` set. However, since `leftToCheck` is initially an empty set, there are no elements to remove. Therefore, the operation does not change the state of `leftToCheck`.

All other variables (`graph`, `cliqueSize`, `isGood`) remain unchanged because the code only affects `leftToCheck`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.**
