The code `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` appends the value `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact structure of `graph`, only that `m` must be at least `n + 1`. Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, it is implied that `i` is one more than `n`. The value of `i` itself is not directly involved in the operation, but it is part of the precondition.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `m` must be at least `n + 1`
- `edge` is a map of integers from the input line

After executing the code, `graph[edge[0]]` will have `edge[1]` appended to its list. The variables `i` and `m` remain unchanged based on the given information.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `m` must be at least `n + 1`, `graph[edge[0]]` now includes `edge[1]` in its list.**
