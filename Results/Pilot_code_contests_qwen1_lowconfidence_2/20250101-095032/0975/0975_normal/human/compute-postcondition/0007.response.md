The code `graph[i + 1] = []` adds an empty list as the value for the key `i + 1` in the dictionary `graph`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, `graph[3]` is now an empty list. The values of `n` and `graph[1]` and `graph[2]` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 2, `graph[1]` is an empty list, `graph[2]` is an empty list, `graph[3]` is an empty list**
