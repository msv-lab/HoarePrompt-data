The code sets `isGood` to `False`. The value of `isGood` was previously unknown, but now it is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `graph`, `cliqueSize`, and `leftToCheck` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is either a non-empty set or becomes an empty set depending on the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`**
