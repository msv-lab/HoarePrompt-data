The code `cliqueSize = len(neighbors)` calculates the length of the list `neighbors` and assigns it to the variable `cliqueSize`. The length of `neighbors` is the number of elements in the list, which represents the number of vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m + 1` to `n` except for the popped element, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is the popped element from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is a list of all vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`**.
