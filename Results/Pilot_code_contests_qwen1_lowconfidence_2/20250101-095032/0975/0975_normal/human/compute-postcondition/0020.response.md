The code appends `edge[0]` to `graph[edge[1]]`. Initially, `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]` (appears twice) and `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`. After executing the code, `graph[edge[1]]` will now include `edge[0]` in addition to the existing elements.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `m` is at least `n + 1`
- `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]` (appears twice)
- `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`
- `edge` is a tuple containing two integers read from stdin

After running the code, `graph[edge[1]]` will now contain `edge[0]`, `edge[1]`, and `edge[1]` (appears twice).

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `m` is at least `n + 1`, `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]` (appears twice), `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]`, `edge[1]`, and `edge[1]` (appears twice)**
