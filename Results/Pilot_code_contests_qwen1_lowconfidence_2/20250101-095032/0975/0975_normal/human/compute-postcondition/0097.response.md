Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and another integer `m` from standard input, representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph respectively. It then constructs an undirected graph using these inputs. After constructing the graph, the function checks whether every vertex has the same number of neighbors (i.e., whether the graph is a clique). If all vertices have the same number of neighbors, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the graph is a clique; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it may raise an error if the input values are out of the specified ranges or if the graph construction fails due to malformed input.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
1. If `n` is less than 3 or greater than 150,000, or if `m` is negative or exceeds the maximum possible number of edges for `n`, the function should handle these cases appropriately, possibly by raising an error or providing a more descriptive message.
2. If the input edges do not form a valid graph (e.g., duplicate edges or edges connecting a vertex to itself), the function should handle these cases and provide appropriate feedback or correction.
3. The function assumes that the input edges are unique, but there is no validation for this assumption. If duplicate edges are provided, the function might incorrectly conclude that the graph is a clique when it is not.
