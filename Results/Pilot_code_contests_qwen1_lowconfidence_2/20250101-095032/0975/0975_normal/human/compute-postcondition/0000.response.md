The code reads two integers from standard input, `n` and `m`, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. Since the input values are read from the standard input, the specific values of `n` and `m` are not known in this context. However, we know their ranges and the conditions they must satisfy.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000; `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2; the values of `n` and `m` are assigned the integers read from standard input.**
