Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
