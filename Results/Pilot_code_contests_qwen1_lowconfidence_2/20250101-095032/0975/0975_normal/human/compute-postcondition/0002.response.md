Let's break down the given program state and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\)
- `graph` is an empty dictionary `{}`

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for i in range(n)` implies that the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 (since \(3 \leq n\)).

2. **Variables Involved**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `n`. The values of `m` and the `graph` dictionary do not affect the loop's execution.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is specified to be within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0.
   - `m` and the `graph` dictionary do not need to be explicitly mentioned as they do not affect the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is initially set to 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 0**
