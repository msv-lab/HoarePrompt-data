The code `leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))` removes the set `set(neighbors)` from the set `leftToCheck` if it exists. Since the initial state specifies that `leftToCheck` is an empty set, there is nothing to remove.

- `i` is `m`, which is the number of edges.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `graph` remains unchanged.
- `leftToCheck` remains an empty set.
- `isGood` remains `False` or `True` depending on the condition that was checked previously.
- `checkMe` remains the last popped element from `leftToCheck`, which is still undefined since `leftToCheck` is empty.
- `neighbors` remains an empty list.
- `cliqueSize` remains the number of elements in the initial `neighbors` list, which is 0 because `neighbors` is initially empty.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False` or `True`, `checkMe` is undefined, `neighbors` is an empty list, and `cliqueSize` is 0.**
