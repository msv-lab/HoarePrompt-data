The code `graph[i + 1] = []` adds an empty list to the `graph` dictionary at the key `i + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `i + 1` becomes 2. Therefore, `graph[2]` is set to an empty list. The values of `n` and `graph[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), `i` is 1, `graph[1]` is an empty list, `graph[2]` is an empty list**
