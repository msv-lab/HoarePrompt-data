`cliqueSize` is reassigned the value of the length of the list `neighbors`. The length of `neighbors` is determined by the number of keys in the dictionary `graph` that correspond to `checkMe`.

Therefore, the `cliqueSize` is now the number of neighbors `checkMe` has in the graph.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph`.**
