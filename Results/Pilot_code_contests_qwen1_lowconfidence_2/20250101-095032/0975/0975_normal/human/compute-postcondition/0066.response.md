Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.** 

### Explanation:
- **`graph`**: The `graph` remains unchanged throughout the loop since no modifications are made to it inside the loop.
- **`cliqueSize`**: This variable also remains unchanged as it is used only for comparison and not modified within the loop.
- **`isGood`**: The value of `isGood` remains `False` because the loop checks if the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`. As soon as this condition is met, `isGood` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Since this condition is met at least once during the loop's execution, `isGood` stays `False`.
- **`leftToCheck`**: The `leftToCheck` set becomes empty when the loop breaks due to the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`. Once `leftToCheck` becomes empty, the loop terminates.

Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds any `neighbor` such that `len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize`, the final state of `leftToCheck` is guaranteed to be an empty set. The other variables (`graph`, `cliqueSize`, and `isGood`) retain their original or unchanged values throughout the loop's execution.
