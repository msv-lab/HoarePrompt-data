Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` is at least one element less than before; `checkMe` is the element that was popped from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` from the dictionary `graph` and must have at least one element; for all `neighbor` in the updated `neighbors` list, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`. If `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It maintains the integrity of the preconditions while summarizing the outcomes of both branches of the conditional statement.
