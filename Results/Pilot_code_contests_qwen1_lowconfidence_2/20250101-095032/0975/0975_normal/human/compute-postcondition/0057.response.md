The code sets `isGood` to `False`. This directly changes the value of `isGood`. The other variables remain in their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` is False; `leftToCheck` is a set with at least one element**
