According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `leftToCheck`. If the length of `leftToCheck` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `leftToCheck` is an empty set.

For the loop to execute one more time, `leftToCheck` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `leftToCheck` is not empty.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` must contain at least one element**
