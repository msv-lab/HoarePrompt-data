The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. However, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned in the given code snippet, the only affected variable is `isGood`, which would be set to `False` due to breaking out of a potential loop or condition. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set(), `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the popped element from `leftToCheck` (and `checkMe` must have at least one neighbor), `neighbors` is a list of remaining vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, and `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors` minus one (since `neighbor` has just been processed). We break out of the most internal loop or condition.**
