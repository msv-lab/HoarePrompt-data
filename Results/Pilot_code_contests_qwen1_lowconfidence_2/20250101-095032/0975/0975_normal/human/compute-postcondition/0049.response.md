The code `cliqueSize = len(neighbors)` assigns the length of the `neighbors` list to the variable `cliqueSize`. Since `neighbors` is the list of vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, the value of `cliqueSize` will be the number of elements in this list.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set with one fewer element, `isGood` is `False` or `True`, `checkMe` is the last element popped from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, and `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in the `neighbors` list.**
