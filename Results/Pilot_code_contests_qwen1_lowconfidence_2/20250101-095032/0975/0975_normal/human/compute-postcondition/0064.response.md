The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional statement. Given the initial state, none of the variables are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
