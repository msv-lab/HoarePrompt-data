Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `m` is at least `n + 1`
   - `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]`
   - `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(m)`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**: Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute if `i < m`.

4. **Next Value of `i`**: If the loop executes again, `i` will increment by 1, so `i` will become `n + 2`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`. Given that `m` is at least `n + 1`, the next value of `i` (which is `n + 2`) must still be less than `m`.

6. **Adjusting States**: We need to ensure that `i` is incremented to `n + 2` and `m` remains at least `n + 1`.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `m` is at least `n + 1`
- `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]`
- `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `m` is at least `n + 1`, `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]`, `graph[edge[1]]` includes `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`**
