The code `leftToCheck = set([])` assigns an empty set to the variable `leftToCheck`. This overwrites the previous value of `leftToCheck`, which was initially a set(). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is an empty set(), `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the popped element from `leftToCheck` (and `checkMe` must have at least one neighbor), `neighbors` is a list of remaining vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, and `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors` minus one (since `neighbor` has just been processed).**
