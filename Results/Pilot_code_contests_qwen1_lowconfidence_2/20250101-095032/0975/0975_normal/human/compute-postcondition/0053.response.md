The variable `leftToCheck` is assigned a new empty set, and the previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; the neighbor being checked has a list length in `graph` that is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is False; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are neighbors and values are lists of integers; `cliqueSize` is an integer; the neighbor being checked has a list length in `graph` that is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is False; `leftToCheck` is a set([])**
