The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or block of code. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block before the `break`, the impact of the `break` statement is to exit whatever block of code it was within. However, based on the given initial state, it implies that the `break` is part of a loop or conditional structure that was being executed.

Given the initial state, the variables `i`, `m`, `graph`, `leftToCheck`, `isGood`, `checkMe`, `neighbors`, and `cliqueSize` retain their original values because the `break` statement does not modify them. The only thing that changes is the context in which these variables are being used, which would now be outside the loop or block that was previously being executed.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is the number of edges, `graph` is a dictionary where each key `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) maps to a list containing all vertices connected to vertex `k` by an edge, `leftToCheck` is a set(), `isGood` is `False`, `checkMe` is the popped element from `leftToCheck` (and `checkMe` must have at least one neighbor), `neighbors` is a non-empty list of all vertices connected to `checkMe` by an edge, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`, and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
