The function reads an integer `n` and another integer `m` from standard input, representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph respectively. It then constructs an undirected graph using these inputs. After constructing the graph, the function checks whether every vertex has the same number of neighbors (i.e., whether the graph is a clique). If all vertices have the same number of neighbors, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the graph is a clique; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it may raise an error if the input values are out of the specified ranges or if the graph construction fails due to malformed input.
