The function reads two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p` (where `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers). The second line contains a list of integers `nums`. The function then processes these inputs to count the number of operations needed to discard special items in `nums` based on the indices specified in `p`. Each operation discards items until reaching the next special item or the end of the list. The function prints the total number of operations performed. Potential edge cases include when `m` is zero, in which case no operations are needed, and when the last item in `nums` is a special item. The function also handles cases where the indices in `p` are not within the bounds of `nums`.
