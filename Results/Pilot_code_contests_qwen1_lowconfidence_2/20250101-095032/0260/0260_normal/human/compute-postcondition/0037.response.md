State right before the loop: No state adjustments needed.

To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the conditions inside the `while` loop:

1. The loop condition is `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, both parts of the condition need to be true when the loop starts.

Let's break down the conditions:

- `i < m`: This means that `i` should be less than `m` for the loop to start.
- `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`: This condition involves the array `nums`, the index `i`, the variable `offset`, the variable `curr`, and the constant `k`.

Given that no specific values or states are mentioned as needing adjustment, we assume that the initial state already satisfies these conditions. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.
