The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, or `nums`. Therefore, the only change is that `curr` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`; `m` is the second integer from the list `data`; `k` is the third integer from the list `data`; `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `curr` is 0.**
