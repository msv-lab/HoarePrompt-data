The code `n = data[0]` assigns the first element of the list `data` to the variable `n`. Since `data` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` now holds the first integer from this list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of special items to be discarded, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of positions in each page, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `data` is a list of integers read from the input.**
