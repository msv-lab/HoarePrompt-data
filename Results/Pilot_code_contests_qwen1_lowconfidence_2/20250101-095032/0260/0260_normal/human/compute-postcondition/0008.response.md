The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `op`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`; `m` is the second integer from the list `data`; `k` is the third integer from the list `data`; `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `curr` is 0; `offset` is 0; `i` is 0; `op` is 0.**
