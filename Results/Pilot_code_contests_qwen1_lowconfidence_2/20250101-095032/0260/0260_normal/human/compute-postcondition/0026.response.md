Let's break down the given program state and the while loop condition step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is the first integer from the list `data`
- `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0
- `k` is the third integer from the list `data`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input
- `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition
- `offset` is either 0 or `m`
- `i` is `1`
- `op` is either 1 or 0
- `nums[0]` must be such that `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true when `i` is `0`.

### While Loop Condition:
```
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
   
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is `1` at the start of this iteration.
   - To satisfy the condition `i < m`, we need `1 < m`, which is already satisfied since `m > 0`.
   - We need to check the condition `nums[1] <= offset + curr * k + k` to see if the loop should continue.

3. **Current Value of `nums[1]`**:
   - Since `nums[1]` is an integer in the list `nums`, it must be checked against the condition.
   - For the loop to continue, `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `nums[1]` must be within the range defined by the condition `nums[1] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums[1]` satisfies this condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` is `1`, `op` is either 1 or 0, and `nums[1]` must be such that `nums[1] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true.**
