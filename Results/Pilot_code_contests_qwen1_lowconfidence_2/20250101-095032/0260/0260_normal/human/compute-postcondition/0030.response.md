Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first integer from the list `data`.
- `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the third integer from the list `data`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition.
- `offset` is either 0 or `m`.
- `i` must be `0`.
- `op` is either 1 or 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

### Observations from the Example:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `i` becomes `1`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `i` becomes `2`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `i` remains `2`.

From this, we can infer that the loop continues until `i` reaches `m` or the condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` fails.

### Final State Analysis:
- Since the loop continues until `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`, the loop will continue until `i` equals `m`. This means the loop will terminate when `i` equals `m`.
- At the termination of the loop, `i` will be equal to `m`.
- The value of `curr` will be determined based on the initial value of `nums[0]` and the condition, but it does not change within the loop unless there is an external change, so we assume it remains as per the initial condition.
- `op` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

### Conclusion:
After the loop has executed, the final state of the variables will be:
- `n` remains the same as the first integer from the list `data`.
- `m` remains the same as the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` remains the same as the third integer from the list `data`.
- `p` remains the same as the list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
- `nums` remains the same as the list of integers read from the input.
- `curr` remains as either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition.
- `offset` remains either 0 or `m`.
- `i` is equal to `m`.
- `op` remains either 1 or 0.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` is `m`, and `op` is either 1 or 0.**
