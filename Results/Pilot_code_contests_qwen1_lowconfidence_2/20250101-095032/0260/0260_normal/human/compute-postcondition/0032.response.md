The code increments the value of `op` by 1. Since `op` was either 1 or 0, after the increment, `op` will now be 2 or 1, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is `m`, `i` is `m`, and `op` is 2 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is `m`, `i` is `m`, and `op` is 2 or 1.**
