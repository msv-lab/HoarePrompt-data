Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented from its previous value)
- `i` must be less than `m - 1`
- `nums[i]` must satisfy the inequality `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `i < m`:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` was `i + 1` in the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m - 1` (because `i` will increment again).
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `m` but not necessarily `m - 1` (since it would then become `m` in the next iteration and fail the condition).

2. **Condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`:**
   - This condition checks if the current element `nums[i]` meets the specified threshold.
   - For the loop to continue, this condition must hold true for the next value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, both conditions must be satisfied:
- `i` must be less than `m` (so that the next increment of `i` does not exceed `m`).
- `nums[i + 1]` must satisfy the inequality `nums[i + 1] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

### Final State:
- `i` must be less than `m`.
- `nums[i + 1]` must satisfy the inequality `nums[i + 1] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is less than `m` and `nums[i + 1]` must satisfy the inequality `nums[i + 1] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
