Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is an integer, `offset` is an integer, `i` is `m`, and `op` is an integer indicating the number of times the loop was executed.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate as long as `i < m`. Each iteration checks if the current element in `nums` (i.e., `nums[i]`) satisfies the condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
- If the condition is satisfied, the loop increments `i` until it finds an element that does not satisfy the condition or reaches the end of the list (`i == m`). At this point, `offset` is set to `i` and `op` is incremented by 1.
- If the condition is not satisfied, `curr` is updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
- Once the loop exits, `i` will be equal to `m` because the loop will either increment `i` until it reaches `m` or exit due to the condition not being met anymore.
- `op` will indicate the number of times the loop was executed, which is determined by the number of valid segments found in `nums` based on the given conditions.
