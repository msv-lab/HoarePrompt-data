The code `print(op)` simply prints the value of the variable `op`, which represents the number of times the loop was executed. This does not change the value of `op` itself, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. The output of the program is the value of `op`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is an integer, `offset` is an integer, `i` is `m`, and `op` is printed.**
