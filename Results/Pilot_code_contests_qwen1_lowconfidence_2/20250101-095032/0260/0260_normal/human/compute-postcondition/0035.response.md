Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` is `m`, and `op` is 2 or 1 if `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`, otherwise `op` remains 1 or 0, `curr` remains unchanged or updated as specified.***
