The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 4, so after the increment, `i` becomes 5. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 5, `m` must be greater than 4, and `nums[4] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` must be greater than 4, and `nums[4] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
