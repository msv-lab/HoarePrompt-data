The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of items.
- `m` is a positive integer representing the number of special items to be discarded.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of positions in each page.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq m\), and \(p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m\).

Based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function may return some form of result depending on the operations performed on these inputs. However, without specific details on what the function does with these parameters, we can only describe the parameters themselves.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers.**
