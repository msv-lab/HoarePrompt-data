The code reads input from the user using `raw_input()`, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int)`. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of items.
- `m` is a positive integer representing the number of special items to be discarded.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of positions in each page.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.

After executing the code, the variable `data` is updated with the values read from the input, but the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of items; `m` is a positive integer representing the number of special items to be discarded; `k` is a positive integer representing the number of positions in each page; `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded; `data` is a list of integers read from the input.**
