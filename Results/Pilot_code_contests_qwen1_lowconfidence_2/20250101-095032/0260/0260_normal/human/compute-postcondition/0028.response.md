Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as:
\[ i < m \text{ and } nums[i] \leq offset + curr \times k + k \]

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- \( n \) is the first integer from the list `data`
- \( m \) is the second integer from the list `data` and \( m \) must be greater than 0
- \( k \) is the third integer from the list `data`
- \( p \) is a list of \( m \) distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded
- \( nums \) is a list of integers read from the input
- \( curr \) is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition
- \( offset \) is either 0 or \( m \)
- \( i \) is 2
- \( op \) is either 1 or 0
- \( nums[1] \) must satisfy the condition \( nums[1] \leq offset + curr \times k + k \)

### Loop Execution Analysis
For the loop to continue:
1. \( i \) must be less than \( m \)
2. \( nums[i] \) must be less than or equal to \( offset + curr \times k + k \)

Given that \( i \) is currently 2, we need to ensure that:
1. \( i < m \)
2. \( nums[2] \leq offset + curr \times k + k \)

### Adjusting the States
1. **\( i < m \)**: Since \( i \) is 2, for the loop to continue, \( m \) must be greater than 2.
2. **\( nums[2] \leq offset + curr \times k + k \)**: This condition must hold true for the loop to continue.

Since the state of \( nums[2] \) is dependent on the values of \( offset \), \( curr \), and \( k \), and given the constraints on these values, we need to ensure that \( nums[2] \) satisfies the inequality.

### Final State Adjustment
- Ensure \( m > 2 \)
- Ensure \( nums[2] \leq offset + curr \times k + k \)

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, and `nums[2]` must satisfy the condition \( nums[2] \leq offset + curr \times k + k \)**
