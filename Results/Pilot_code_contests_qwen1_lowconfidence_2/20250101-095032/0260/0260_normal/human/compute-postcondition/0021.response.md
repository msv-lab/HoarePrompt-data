Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is the first integer from the list `data`
   - `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0
   - `k` is the third integer from the list `data`
   - `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input
   - `curr` is 0
   - `offset` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `op` is 0
   - `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`

2. Code: `curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`

   - The value of `curr` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to it.
   - The expression evaluates as follows:
     - `offset + curr * k + k` is compared with `nums[i]` in the precondition, and since it is true, we can use this to simplify our calculation.
     - Let's denote `offset + curr * k + k` as `base`.
     - So, the expression becomes `(nums[i] - base - 1) / k`.

Given the condition `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, we know that `nums[i]` is indeed greater than `base`. Therefore, the expression `(nums[i] - base - 1) / k` will evaluate to a non-negative integer because `nums[i] - base - 1` is a positive integer.

3. Updated Values:
   - `curr` is updated by adding the evaluated result of the expression to its current value (which is 0).
   - `offset` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `op` remains unchanged.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.

So, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0, `op` is 0**.
