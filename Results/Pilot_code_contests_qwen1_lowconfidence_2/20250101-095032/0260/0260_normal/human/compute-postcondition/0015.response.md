Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as both conditions `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` are true.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `m` is greater than 1
   - `nums[2] <= k`

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented (i.e., `i` should be 4) and the condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` must hold true for `i = 4`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the only way to proceed to the next iteration is to set `i` to 4.
   - We need to check if `nums[4]` satisfies the condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` when `i = 4`.

4. **Check the condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `nums[2] <= k`.
   - We don't have information about `nums[4]` directly, but we can infer that for the loop to continue, `nums[4]` must satisfy the condition.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Set `i` to 4 to proceed to the next iteration.
   - Ensure that `m` remains greater than 4 (since `i` is now 4).
   - Ensure that `nums[4]` satisfies the condition `nums[4] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

Given these points, the final state before the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `m` must be greater than 4, and `nums[4] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
