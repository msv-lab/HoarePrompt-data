The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 1 (since `i += 1` increments `i` by 1), `op` is 0, and the value of `nums[0]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 1, `op` is 0, and the value of `nums[0]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k**.
