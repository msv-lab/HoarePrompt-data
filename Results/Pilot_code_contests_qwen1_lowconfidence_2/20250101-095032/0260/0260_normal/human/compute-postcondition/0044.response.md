The code `offset = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `offset`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `offset` is now set to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the smallest index `j` such that `nums[j]` does not satisfy the inequality `nums[j] <= offset + curr * k + k`, or `i` is equal to `m` if no such index exists, and `i` must have been less than `m` initially; `offset` is equal to `i`**
