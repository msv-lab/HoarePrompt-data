Let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is the first integer from the list `data`.
   - `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is the third integer from the list `data`.
   - `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `curr` is 0.
   - `offset` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `op` is 0.
   - The value of `nums[0]` is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Current Values at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` is 1, the condition `i < m` is true only if `m > 1`.
   - The condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` simplifies to `nums[1] <= offset + 0 * k + k` because `curr` is 0. This further simplifies to `nums[1] <= k`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to continue executing one more time, the following must be true:
     - `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 1).
     - The condition `i < m` must still hold true, meaning `m` must be greater than 1.
     - The condition `nums[2] <= k` must hold true.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - We need to ensure `i` becomes 2.
   - We need to ensure `m` is greater than 1.
   - We need to ensure `nums[2] <= k`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, and `nums[2]` must be less than or equal to `k`**.
