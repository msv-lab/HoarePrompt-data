The code updates the value of `curr` based on the formula `curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`. Given that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, we know that `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1)` will result in a positive integer since subtracting `offset + curr * k + 1` from `nums[i]` leaves a remainder that is at least `k`. 

Let's denote this positive integer as `余数` (remainder), which is `nums[i] - offset - curr * k - 1`. This remainder is then divided by `k`, and the integer division of this operation is added to `curr`.

Since the exact value of `nums[i]` is not specified, we can express the updated value of `curr` as:

\[ \text{new\_curr} = \text{curr} + \left\lfloor \frac{\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times \text{k}) - 1}{\text{k}} \right\rfloor \]

Given that `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`, the remainder when `nums[i] - (offset + curr * k + 1)` is divided by `k` will be between `0` and `k-1`. Therefore, the integer division of the remainder by `k` will be `0`.

Thus, the updated value of `curr` will simply be:

\[ \text{curr} = \text{curr} + 0 \]

So, the value of `curr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nums[i]` is an integer, `offset` is an integer, `curr` is an integer, `k` is an integer; `curr` remains unchanged.**
