The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `i` was 1, so now it will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` is 2, `op` is either 1 or 0, and `nums[1]` must be such that `nums[1] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true.**
