The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. The variables `i` and `offset` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to the smallest index `j` such that `nums[j]` does not satisfy the inequality `nums[j] <= offset + curr * k + k`, or `i` is equal to `m` if no such index exists, and `i` must have been less than `m` initially; `offset` is equal to `i`; `op` is increased by 1.
