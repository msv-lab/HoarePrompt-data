Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current program state to determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given `while` Loop
```python
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current Program State Before the Loop
- `n` is the first integer from the list `data`.
- `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the third integer from the list `data`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition.
- `offset` is either 0 or `m`.
- `i` must be `0`.
- `op` is either 1 or 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m` and `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is initially `0`.
   - `offset` is either `0` or `m`.
   - Since `m` is guaranteed to be greater than 0, `i < m` will always be true at least once.

3. **Condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**:
   - At the start, `i` is `0`.
   - Therefore, the condition simplifies to `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

4. **Determining `curr`**:
   - Since `i` is `0`, we need to consider the value of `curr`:
     - `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\).

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `nums[0]` must satisfy the condition `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and `offset` is either `0` or `m`, let's consider both cases:
     - If `offset = 0`, the condition becomes `nums[0] <= curr * k + k`.
     - If `offset = m`, the condition becomes `nums[0] <= (curr * k + k) + m`.

6. **Possible Values of `curr`**:
   - If `curr = 0`, the condition simplifies to `nums[0] <= k`.
   - If `curr` is calculated using the formula, it might be non-zero, but the exact value depends on `nums[0]`.

7. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute, `nums[0]` must be such that the condition holds true when `i` is `0`.
   - Since `m` is already greater than `0`, the primary concern is ensuring `nums[0]` meets the condition with the appropriate `curr`.

### Conclusion
The state that needs to be adjusted is `nums[0]` must be such that the condition `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true when `i` is `0`.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` must be `0`, and `op` is either 1 or 0, `nums[0]` must be such that `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true when `i` is `0`**.
