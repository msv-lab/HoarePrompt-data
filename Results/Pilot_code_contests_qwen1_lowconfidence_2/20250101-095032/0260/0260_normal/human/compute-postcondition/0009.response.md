To ensure that the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `i < m` evaluates to `True`.

Given the current state:
- `n` is the first integer from the list `data`.
- `m` is the second integer from the list `data`.
- `k` is the third integer from the list `data`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `curr` is 0.
- `offset` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `op` is 0.

The loop condition is `i < m`. Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 (or any value greater than 0 but still less than `m`). This means `m` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0, `op` is 0**.
