The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This means that the new list `nums` is created and populated with the integers from the input. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p` are no longer relevant to the current state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`; `m` is the second integer from the list `data`; `k` is the third integer from the list `data`; `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**
