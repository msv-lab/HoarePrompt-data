The code updates the value of `curr` by adding `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` to its current value. Given the precondition, `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, this ensures that the subtraction and division operations are well-defined.

Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses: `nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1`.
2. Divide the result by `k`.

Since `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, the subtraction `nums[i] - (offset + curr * k + k)` is positive, and subtracting 1 from it will still result in a positive number. Dividing this positive number by `k` results in an integer value, as `k` is a positive integer.

Let's denote the new value of `curr` as `new_curr`. The calculation is:
\[ \text{new\_curr} = \text{curr} + \frac{\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1}{\text{k}} \]

Given that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, the term \(\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1\) is positive and divisible by `k`, so the division results in an integer.

Therefore, the updated value of `curr` is:
\[ \text{curr} = \text{curr} + \left( \frac{\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1}{\text{k}} \right) \]

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` is 0, and `op` is either 1 or 0.**
