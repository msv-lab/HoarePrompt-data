Postcondition: ***`i` is an index within the bounds of `nums`, `offset` is an integer, `curr` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `op` is an integer. If `nums[i]` satisfies the inequality `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`, then `curr` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is equal to the smallest index `j` such that `nums[j]` does not satisfy the inequality, or `i` equals `m` if no such index exists, `offset` is set to `i`, and `op` is increased by 1.***
