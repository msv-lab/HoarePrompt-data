The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously equal to `1` (as it starts as the first integer from the list `data`), after executing this line, `i` will be `2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, and `nums[2]` must satisfy the condition \( \text{nums}[2] \leq \text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k + k \); `i` is 2.**
