Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given Program State
- `n` is the first integer from the list `data`.
- `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the third integer from the list `data`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `curr` is either 0 or updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`.
- `offset` is either 0 or `m`.
- `i` is `m`.
- `op` is 2 or 1 if `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`, otherwise `op` remains 1 or 0.
- `curr` remains unchanged or updated as specified.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`. Given that `i` is currently set to `m` in the program state, this means that `i` is no longer less than `m`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time under the current conditions.

### Conclusion
Since `i` is already equal to `m`, the loop condition `i < m` is false, and the loop will not execute one more time. There is no need to adjust any of the states to allow the loop to proceed.

### Final Answer
State: **No state adjustments needed.**
