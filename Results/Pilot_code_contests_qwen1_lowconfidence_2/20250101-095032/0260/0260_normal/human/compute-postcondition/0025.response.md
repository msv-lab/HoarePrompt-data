The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` must be `0`. After executing the code, `i` will be `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[0] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` is `1`, and `op` is either 1 or 0, `nums[0]` must be such that `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k` holds true when `i` is `0`.**
