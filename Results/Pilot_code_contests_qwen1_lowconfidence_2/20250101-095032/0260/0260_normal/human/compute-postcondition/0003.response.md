The code `k = data[2]` assigns the third element of the list `data` (indexing starts at 0) to the variable `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`; `m` is the second integer from the list `data`; `k` is the third integer from the list `data`; `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded; `data` is a list of integers read from the input.**
