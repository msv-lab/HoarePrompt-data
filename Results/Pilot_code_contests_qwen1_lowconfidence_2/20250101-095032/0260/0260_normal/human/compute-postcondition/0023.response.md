To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop itself.

Given:
- The loop runs as long as `i < m`.
- We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least one more iteration.

Current states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the first integer from the list `data`.
- `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the third integer from the list `data`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition.
- `offset` is either 0 or `m`.
- `i` is either `m` or 0.
- `op` is either 1 or 0.

The loop condition is `i < m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy the condition `i < m` in the next iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is either `m` or `0`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- If `i` is `m`, then the loop will terminate because `m` is not less than `m`.
- Therefore, `i` must be `0` for the loop to continue.

So, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is `0`.

The adjusted state should be:
- `n` is the first integer from the list `data`.
- `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the third integer from the list `data`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition.
- `offset` is either 0 or `m`.
- `i` must be `0`.
- `op` is either 1 or 0.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or \((\text{nums}[i] - (\text{offset} + \text{curr} \times k) - 1) / k\) depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` must be `0`, and `op` is either 1 or 0**
