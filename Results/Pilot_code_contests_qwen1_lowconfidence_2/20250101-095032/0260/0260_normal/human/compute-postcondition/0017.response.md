Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is `m`, `op` is 0, and for all `j` in range `m`, `nums[p[j]-1]` is not in the range `[offset + curr * k, offset + curr * k + k]`.**
