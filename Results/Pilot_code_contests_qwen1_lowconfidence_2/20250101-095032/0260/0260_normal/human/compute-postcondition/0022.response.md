Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is either 0 or (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k depending on the condition, `offset` is either 0 or `m`, `i` is either `m` or 0, and `op` is either 1 or 0***
