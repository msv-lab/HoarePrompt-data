`op` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `op + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `op` is 0, so after incrementing, `op` becomes 1.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is 0, `i` is `m`, `op` is 1, and `offset` is `m`.**
