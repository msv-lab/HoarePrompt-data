#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of items, m is a positive integer representing the number of special items to be discarded, k is a positive integer representing the number of positions in each page, and p is a list of m distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m, and p_1 < p_2 < … < p_m.
def func():
    data = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    n = data[0]
    m = data[1]
    k = data[2]
    nums = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    curr = 0
    offset = 0
    i = 0
    op = 0
    while i < m:
        if nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
            while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
                i += 1
            offset = i
            op += 1
        else:
            curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer from the list `data`, `m` is the second integer from the list `data` and `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the list `data`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is an integer, `offset` is an integer, `i` is `m`, and `op` is an integer indicating the number of times the loop was executed.
    print(op)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p` (where `p` is a list of `m` distinct positive integers). The second line contains a list of integers `nums`. The function then processes these inputs to count the number of operations needed to discard special items in `nums` based on the indices specified in `p`. Each operation discards items until reaching the next special item or the end of the list. The function prints the total number of operations performed. Potential edge cases include when `m` is zero, in which case no operations are needed, and when the last item in `nums` is a special item. The function also handles cases where the indices in `p` are not within the bounds of `nums`.
