Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the last page might contain special items but is not fully processed. Specifically, the program increments `curr` without checking if the current page contains special items, which can lead to incorrect operation counts.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  10 4 3
  3 6 9 10
  ```

Expected output:
- The first page [1, 2, 3] contains a special item (3), so Tokitsukaze discards it and moves to the next page. The second page [4, 5, 6] contains a special item (6), so she discards it and moves to the next page. The third page [7, 8, 9] contains a special item (9), so she discards it and moves to the last page. The last page [10] contains the final special item (10), so she discards it. Therefore, the total number of operations should be 4.

However, the given program will incorrectly output 3 because it does not properly handle the last page's special item.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all pages, including the last one, are checked for special items before incrementing the operation count.
