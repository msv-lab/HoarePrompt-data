Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Operations**: The code calculates the number of operations based on the current position and the offset but does not properly handle the discarding of items and the movement of subsequent items correctly. Specifically, the logic to update the `curr` and `offset` variables is flawed and does not accurately reflect the described behavior of the game.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the edge case where the last item in `nums` is a special item. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   10 1 5
   10
   ```
   The code does not increment the operation counter for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

3. **General Logic Flaw**: The code's logic for determining the first special page and discarding items is incorrect. It incorrectly updates the `offset` and `curr` variables without considering the full movement and repositioning of items after discarding.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific example:
- Input:
  ```
  10 4 5
  3 5 7 10
  ```
  The expected output is `3`, but the provided code might produce an incorrect result due to the flaws mentioned above.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
