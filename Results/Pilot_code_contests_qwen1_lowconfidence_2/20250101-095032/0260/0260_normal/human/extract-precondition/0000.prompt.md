You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Recently, Tokitsukaze found an interesting game. Tokitsukaze had n items at the beginning of this game. However, she thought there were too many items, so now she wants to discard m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) special items of them.

These n items are marked with indices from 1 to n. In the beginning, the item with index i is placed on the i-th position. Items are divided into several pages orderly, such that each page contains exactly k positions and the last positions on the last page may be left empty.

Tokitsukaze would do the following operation: focus on the first special page that contains at least one special item, and at one time, Tokitsukaze would discard all special items on this page. After an item is discarded or moved, its old position would be empty, and then the item below it, if exists, would move up to this empty position. The movement may bring many items forward and even into previous pages, so Tokitsukaze would keep waiting until all the items stop moving, and then do the operation (i.e. check the special page and discard the special items) repeatedly until there is no item need to be discarded.

<image> Consider the first example from the statement: n=10, m=4, k=5, p=[3, 5, 7, 10]. The are two pages. Initially, the first page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). So Tokitsukaze discards the special items with indices 3 and 5. After, the first page remains to be special. It contains [1, 2, 4, 6, 7], Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index 7. After, the second page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). It contains [9, 10], Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index 10.

Tokitsukaze wants to know the number of operations she would do in total.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n) — the number of items, the number of special items to be discarded and the number of positions in each page.

The second line contains m distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_m (1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < … < p_m ≤ n) — the indices of special items which should be discarded.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of operations that Tokitsukaze would do in total.

1

Note

For the first example:

  * In the first operation, Tokitsukaze would focus on the first page [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and discard items with indices 3 and 5; 
  * In the second operation, Tokitsukaze would focus on the first page [1, 2, 4, 6, 7] and discard item with index 7; 
  * In the third operation, Tokitsukaze would focus on the second page [9, 10] and discard item with index 10. 



For the second example, Tokitsukaze would focus on the second page [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and discard all special items at once.
Function definition:
```
def func():
