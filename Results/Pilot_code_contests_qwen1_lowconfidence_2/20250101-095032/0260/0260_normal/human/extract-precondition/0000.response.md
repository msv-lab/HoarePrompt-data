Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer representing the number of items, m is a positive integer representing the number of special items to be discarded, k is a positive integer representing the number of positions in each page, and p is a list of m distinct positive integers representing the indices of special items which should be discarded, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m, and p_1 < p_2 < … < p_m.**
