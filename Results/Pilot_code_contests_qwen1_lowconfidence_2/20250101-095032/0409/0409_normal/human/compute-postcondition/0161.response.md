The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either greater than or equal to `n` or `j` was greater than or equal to `n`. Since `i` was already greater than or equal to `n`, incrementing `i` by 1 means `i` is now greater than `n`. The other conditions and the initial states of `j`, `n`, `marks`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is greater than `n`, `j` is an integer initially set to 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` holds true. The condition `(0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l)` is false.**
