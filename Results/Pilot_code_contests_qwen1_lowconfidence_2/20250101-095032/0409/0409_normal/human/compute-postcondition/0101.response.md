According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the loop condition is true. Since the loop condition is `True`, no specific state adjustment is required for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False**
