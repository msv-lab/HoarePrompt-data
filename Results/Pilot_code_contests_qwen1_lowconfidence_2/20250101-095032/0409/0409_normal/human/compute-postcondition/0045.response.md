Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers, `x_solved` is a boolean with the value `True`, `y_solved` is a boolean with the value `False` or there does not exist any `mark` such that `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`).**
