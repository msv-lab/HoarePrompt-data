Let's break down the given conditions and analyze the program state to determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while True` loop to execute one more time.

### Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` and `j` are integers.
- Either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

### Loop Body Analysis:
- The problem statement describes several conditions under which certain state changes occur. However, since this is a `while True` loop, we don't need to check specific conditions to determine if the loop can execute again; the loop will continue to execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of.

### Determining the Next State:
Since the loop is `while True`, no additional state adjustments are necessary to allow the loop to execute another iteration. The loop will continue to run regardless of the current values of `i` and `j`, as long as the loop is not explicitly exited.

### Conclusion:
No state adjustments are required for the loop to execute one more time because the loop is `while True` and will continue to execute indefinitely unless exited.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` and `j` are integers. Either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
