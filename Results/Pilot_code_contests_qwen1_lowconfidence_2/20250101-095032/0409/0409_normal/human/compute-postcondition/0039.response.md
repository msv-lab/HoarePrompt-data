The line `y_solved = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `y_solved`. The value of `y_solved` was previously `True`, and this assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `marks` is a map object of integers, `x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `True`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is the key of the next item in the `marks` map, `mark` is the value of the next item in the `marks` map, `res_y` is clamped between 0 and `n - 1`, `res_x` is the index where `mark + x` should be inserted to keep `marks` sorted starting from index `i` and up to `min(res_y + 1, n)`, and `res_x` is adjusted to be within the range `[0, n-1]`. If `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, then `x_solved` remains `True`; otherwise, the condition does not change `x_solved`. `y_solved` is `True`.**
