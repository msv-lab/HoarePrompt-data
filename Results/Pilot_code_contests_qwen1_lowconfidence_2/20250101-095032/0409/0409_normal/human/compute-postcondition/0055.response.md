According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the condition inside the loop body is true. However, since no specific condition is given within the loop itself, we focus on the initial conditions that need to be met for the loop to proceed.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is not applicable.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map.
- `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`.
- `y_solved` is `False` or there does not exist any `mark` such that `marks[res_y] == mark + y`.

The key points here are `x_solved` and `y_solved`. Since `y_solved` is `False` initially, the loop can start and potentially change `y_solved` to `True`. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any states except ensuring `y_solved` is `True` after the first iteration.

Since the loop is `while True`, no specific conditions need to be met other than starting the loop. The states provided do not directly affect the loop's continuation, but we need to ensure the loop starts by adjusting `y_solved` to `True`.

State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`**
