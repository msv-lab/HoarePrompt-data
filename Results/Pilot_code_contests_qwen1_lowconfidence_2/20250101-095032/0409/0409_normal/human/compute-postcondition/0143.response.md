Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0, 1, or 2, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. If `i >= n` or `j >= n`, the condition holds as they are either 0, 1, or 2. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, no changes occur. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is either 0 or 1. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is either 1 or 2.***
