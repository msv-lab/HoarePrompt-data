The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal block of code it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, the execution will simply exit the current block of code, which is likely a function or method.

Given that the `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead controls the flow of execution, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.**
