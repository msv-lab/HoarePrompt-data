Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers initially set to 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` holds true. The current value of `(marks[i] + shift_x)` is within the range `[0, l]`***
