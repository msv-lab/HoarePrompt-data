The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block present in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`, and `magic_tick` is either `mark + shift_x` or another value depending on the value of `i`.**
