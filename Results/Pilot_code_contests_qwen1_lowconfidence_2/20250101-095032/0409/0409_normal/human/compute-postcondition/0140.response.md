`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was either 0 or 1, so now `j` will be 1 or 2 respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `j` is either 1 or 2; `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map; `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`); `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`); `x_solved` is `False`; `y_solved` is `False`.**
