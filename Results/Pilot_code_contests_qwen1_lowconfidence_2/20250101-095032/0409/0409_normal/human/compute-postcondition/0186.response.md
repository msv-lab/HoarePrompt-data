`j` is incremented by 1. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or block involves `i` and `j`, which are not affected by simply incrementing `j`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, if `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or block. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
