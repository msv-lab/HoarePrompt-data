The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1 initially, incrementing it by 1 means `i` is now 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1). However, since `i` cannot be greater than 1 based on the precondition (it must be either 0 or 1), the only valid new value for `i` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.**
