The code `res_y = bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)` has the following impact:

- `res_y` is assigned the result of `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)`.
- `bisect.bisect_left` returns the index in the list `marks` where the value `mark + y` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order, without changing the order of existing elements.
- The `lo` parameter specifies that the search should start from index `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer.
- `l` is an integer.
- `x` is an integer.
- `y` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler.
- `marks` is a map object of integers that must contain at least one element.
- `x_solved` is `False`.
- `y_solved` is `False`.
- `magic_tick` is `None`.
- `i` is 0.
- `mark` is the first value in the `marks` map.

Since `i` is 0, `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)` effectively starts the search from the beginning of the `marks` map. The value of `res_y` will be the index where `mark + y` would fit in the sorted `marks` map.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers that must contain at least one element, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is 0, `mark` is the first value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is the index in `marks` where `mark + y` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order.**
