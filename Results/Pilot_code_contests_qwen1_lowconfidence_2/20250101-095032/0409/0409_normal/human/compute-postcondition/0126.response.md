The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case statement. Since there is no loop or switch-case statement in the given code, the execution simply exits the context where this statement was placed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
