`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is an integer and equals its previous value plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or block.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is an integer and equals `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
