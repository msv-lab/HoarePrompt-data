The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or the most internal conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables outside of any loops or conditions. Therefore, the values of `total`, `i`, `j`, `mark`, `res_y`, `res_x`, `x_solved`, `y_solved`, and `magic_tick` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x**, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.
