Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Conditions**: The loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(x, y), (-x, shift_y), (x, -y), (x, y)]`. The loop will execute as long as this list is non-empty.

2. **Initial States**: 
   - `n` is an integer (length of `marks`).
   - `l` is an integer.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `y` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler.
   - `marks` is a map object of integers.
   - `x_solved` is a boolean.
   - `y_solved` is a boolean.
   - `magic_tick` is `None`.
   - `i` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
   - `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map.
   - `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
   - `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
   - `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`.
   - `y_solved` is `False` or there does not exist any `mark` such that `marks[res_y] == mark + y`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute if the list `[(x, y), (-x, shift_y), (x, -y), (x, y)]` is non-empty. This means that the loop can execute because the list always contains exactly 4 elements, regardless of the values of `x` and `y`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the list always contains 4 elements, no adjustments are needed for the list itself.
   - However, we need to ensure that the initial conditions for `x_solved` and `y_solved` are correctly set up to match the loop's logic.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `x_solved` should be `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`.
- `y_solved` should be `False` or there does not exist any `mark` such that `marks[res_y] == mark + y`.

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `False` or there does not exist any `mark` such that `marks[res_y] == mark + y`**.
