`j` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `j` is 0, so after the increment, `j` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or condition. Additionally, the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` is true.**
