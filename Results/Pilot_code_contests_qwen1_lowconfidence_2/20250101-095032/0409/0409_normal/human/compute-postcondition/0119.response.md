Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. If `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`, the function continues with the current values of `i` and `j`. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than `marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0. If `marks[i] + shift_x` is within the range [0, l], then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[0] + shift_x` when `i` is 0, and this value is within the range [0, l]. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are both incremented to 1, and `marks[i] + shift_x` is outside the range [0, l].***
