The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not specified. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement remain the same. Therefore, the updated output state is: `i` is increased by 1, `j` is an integer, if `i` >= `n` or `j` >= `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is an integer, if `i` >= `n` or `j` >= `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
