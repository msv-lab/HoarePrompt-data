`j` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. This condition does not get affected by the increment of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer (and has been incremented by 1), and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
