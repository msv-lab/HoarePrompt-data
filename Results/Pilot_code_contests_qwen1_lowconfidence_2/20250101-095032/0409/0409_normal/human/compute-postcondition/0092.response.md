The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, no variables are modified by this statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`; if `i` >= `n` or `j` >= `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
