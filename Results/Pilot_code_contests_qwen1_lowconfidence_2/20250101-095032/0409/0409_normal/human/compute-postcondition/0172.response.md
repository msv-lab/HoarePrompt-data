The code `break` does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such structure in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
