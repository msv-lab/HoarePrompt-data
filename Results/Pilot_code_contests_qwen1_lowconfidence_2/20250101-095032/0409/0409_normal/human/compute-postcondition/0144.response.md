Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0, 1, or 2, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. If `i >= n` or `j >= n`, the loop terminates and `i` and `j` are either 0, 1, or 2. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, the loop continues with the current values of `i` and `j`. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. If neither condition is met, `i` and `j` are both incremented to 1 or 2, and `marks[i] + shift_x` is outside the range [0, l].**
