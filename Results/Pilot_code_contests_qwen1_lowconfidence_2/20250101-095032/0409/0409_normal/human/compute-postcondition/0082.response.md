The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, and the other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
