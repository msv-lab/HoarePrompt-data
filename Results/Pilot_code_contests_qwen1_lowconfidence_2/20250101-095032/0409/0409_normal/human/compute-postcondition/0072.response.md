Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than `marks[j] + shift_y`. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks[i]` is `mark`, and `shift_x` is a specific value with `magic_tick` being `mark + shift_x`. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks[i]` is `mark`, and `shift_x` is a specific value with `magic_tick` being `mark + shift_x`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and either `marks[i] + shift_x > l` or `marks[i] + shift_x < 0` holds true.***
