The code initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `total`, `mark`, `res_y`, `res_x`, `x_solved`, and `y_solved`. Therefore, the only changes are the new values assigned to `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `False` or there does not exist any `mark` such that `marks[res_y] == mark + y`**
