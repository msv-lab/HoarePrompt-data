The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `i` was 0. After executing the code, `i` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`, and `marks[i] + shift_x > l or marks[i] + shift_x < 0**
