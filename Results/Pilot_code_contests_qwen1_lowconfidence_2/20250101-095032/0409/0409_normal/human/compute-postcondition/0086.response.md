To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while True` loop continues.

Given the loop:
```python
while True:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition inside the loop body is satisfied. However, since the loop is `while True`, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no specific state adjustment is required based on the loop condition itself.

Let's review the given states at the end of the previous iteration:

- `total` is not applicable.
- `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1.
- `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map.
- `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`.
- `y_solved` is `True`.
- If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is either `mark + shift_x` or another value depending on the value of `i`; otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always proceed to the next iteration unless it encounters a break statement. The loop will break under the following conditions:
- `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, causing `j` to be incremented.
- `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, leading to the program breaking out of the loop.
- `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` but `magic_tick` is determined, possibly leading to an early exit from the loop.

However, these conditions are not sufficient to modify the loop state because the loop is guaranteed to execute indefinitely without any explicit termination condition from the loop body.

Therefore, no state modifications are required for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.
