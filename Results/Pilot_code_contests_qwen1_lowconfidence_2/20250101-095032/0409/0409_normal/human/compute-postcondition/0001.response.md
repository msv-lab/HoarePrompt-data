The code snippet `marks = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())` reads a line of input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using the `map` function. However, the initial state specifies that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are already defined and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler. The `map` function does not modify the existing list `a`, but rather creates a new map object.

Since the code does not directly assign the result of `map` to `a` and instead creates a new map object, the list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only affected variable is `marks`, which now holds a map object of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `l` is an integer read from standard input, `x` is an integer read from standard input, `y` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers.**
