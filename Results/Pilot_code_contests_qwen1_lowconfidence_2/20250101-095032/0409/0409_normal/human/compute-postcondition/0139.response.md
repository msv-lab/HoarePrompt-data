`i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1, incrementing it by 1 means `i` is now 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1. However, since the precondition states that `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `i` cannot be 2. Therefore, `i` remains either 0 or 1, and the only valid value for `i` after the operation is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.**
