`j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is the original value of `j` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are: `i` is 0, `j` is 1 (since `j` was originally 0 and it was incremented by 1), `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, and the condition `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y` still holds.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`**
