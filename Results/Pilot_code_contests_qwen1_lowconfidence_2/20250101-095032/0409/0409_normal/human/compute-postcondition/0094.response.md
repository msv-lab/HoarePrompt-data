`j` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `j` is increased by 1. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement remain the same, i.e., if `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `i` is not directly affected by this line of code, but it is mentioned in the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is an integer increased by 1, if `i` >= `n` or `j` >= `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
