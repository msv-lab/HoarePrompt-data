According to the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute at least one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the loop to proceed.

State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.**
