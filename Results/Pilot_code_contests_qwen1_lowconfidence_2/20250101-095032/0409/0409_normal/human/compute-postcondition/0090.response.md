`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still applicable, meaning if `i` is now greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop or if statement will be broken.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is unchanged, if `i` >= `n` or `j` >= `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
