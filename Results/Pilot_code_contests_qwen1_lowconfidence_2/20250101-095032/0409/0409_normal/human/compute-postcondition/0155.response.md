The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The conditions involving `j` and `n`, as well as the relationship between `marks[i] + shift_x` and `marks[j] + shift_y`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to `n`, and the condition (marks[1] + shift_x) < (marks[j] + shift_y) holds true.**
