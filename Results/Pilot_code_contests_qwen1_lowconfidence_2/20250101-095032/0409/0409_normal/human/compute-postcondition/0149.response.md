The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block indicated in the initial state, the `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `j`. The precondition that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`**
