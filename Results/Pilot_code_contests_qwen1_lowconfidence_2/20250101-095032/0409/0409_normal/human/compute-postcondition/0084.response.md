Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`, and if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is either `mark + shift_x` or another value depending on the value of `i`; otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
