Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers that must contain at least one element, `x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `True`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is the key of the next item in the `marks` map, `mark` is the value of the next item in the `marks` map, `res_y` is unchanged and within the range `[0, n - 1]`, `res_x` is unchanged, and the conditions `marks[res_x] == mark + x` and `marks[res_y] == mark + y` both hold true. If `mark + x > l`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional structure.***
