The code `print(2)` simply prints the number 2 to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, `magic_tick`, `x_solved`, `y_solved`, `marks`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers such that `0 <= i < n` and `0 <= j < n` (with one of them being equal to `n`), `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` if the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is not met, `x_solved` is `True` if there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` remains `False` unless a valid `mark` is found for `y` in subsequent iterations, and `marks`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, and `l` remain unchanged.**
