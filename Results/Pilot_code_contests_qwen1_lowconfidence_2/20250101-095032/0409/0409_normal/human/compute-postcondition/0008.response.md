Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers that must contain at least one element, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is 0, `mark` is the first value in the `marks` map. If `mark + x > l`, the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
