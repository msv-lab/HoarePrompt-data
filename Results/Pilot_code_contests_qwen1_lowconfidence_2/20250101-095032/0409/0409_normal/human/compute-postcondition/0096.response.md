Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` remains unchanged, potentially breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, no further changes occur. If this condition is not met, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1, and then we check whether `i` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, potentially breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
