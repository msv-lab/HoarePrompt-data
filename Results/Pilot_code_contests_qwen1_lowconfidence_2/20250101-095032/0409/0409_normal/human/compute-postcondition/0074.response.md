To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while True` loop. Since it is an infinite loop (`while True`), the loop will always execute again unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no specific state modifications are required for the loop to continue.

However, we should ensure that the current state satisfies the given conditions to maintain consistency. Here are the steps:

1. **`total` is not applicable**: This remains unchanged as it was not specified to change.
2. **`i` and `j` are either 0 or 1**: This remains unchanged.
3. **`mark` is the last value in the `marks` map**: This remains unchanged.
4. **`res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`)**: This remains unchanged.
5. **`res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`)**: This remains unchanged.
6. **`x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`**: This remains unchanged.
7. **`y_solved` is `True`**: This remains unchanged.
8. **If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and one of the following conditions holds: `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, or `marks[i] + shift_x > l` or `marks[i] + shift_x < 0` holds true**: This condition is already satisfied by the given states, so no change is needed.

Since the `while True` loop will always execute again, we do not need to adjust any states to ensure it continues.

State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`.**
