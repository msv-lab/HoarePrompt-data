The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial condition is that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or block after this increment, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
