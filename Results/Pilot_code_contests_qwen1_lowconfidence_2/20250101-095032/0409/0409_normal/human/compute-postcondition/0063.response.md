The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing this line, `i` will become 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`, `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than `marks[j] + shift_y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`**
