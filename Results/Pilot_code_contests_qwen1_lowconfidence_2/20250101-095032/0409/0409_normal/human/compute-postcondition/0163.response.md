Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks` is unchanged, `shift_x` is unchanged, `shift_y` is unchanged, `magic_tick` is `marks[0] + shift_x`, and the condition `(marks[0] + shift_x >= marks[0] + shift_y)` still holds true. Otherwise, `i` is greater than `n`, `j` is 1, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
