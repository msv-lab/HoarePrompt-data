To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while True` loop would continue iterating.

Given the loop is `while True`, the loop will continue to execute as long as the condition inside the loop body is met. Since there are no explicit conditions that would cause the loop to terminate, we assume the loop will continue to iterate unless some external factor (not specified in the given information) causes it to break.

Since the problem statement does not specify any conditions that would cause the loop to break, and since `while True` means the loop will run indefinitely unless explicitly stopped, we do not need to adjust any specific states for the loop to execute one more time.

However, to provide a clear answer based on the information given:

State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.**

This is because the `while True` loop will continue to execute regardless of the current values of the variables involved, as long as the loop itself is not explicitly terminated.
