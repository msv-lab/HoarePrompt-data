`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` was either 0 or 1, so now `j` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.**
