Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. If `marks[i] + shift_x` is within the range [0, l], then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[0] + shift_x` when `i` is 0, and this value is within the range [0, l]. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are incremented to 1, and `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than 0 or greater than `l`.***
