To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the initial conditions and how they change during each iteration. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `total` is not applicable.
   - `i` and `j` are integers within the range `[0, n)`.
   - `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map.
   - `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
   - `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
   - `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`.
   - `y_solved` is `True` or `i` and `j` have been updated such that no further iterations can be made (either `i` or `j` is equal to `n`).

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the shifts `(shift_x, shift_y)` in the set `[(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)]`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i` and `j` within the range `[0, n)` must still hold true.
   - `mark` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `res_y` and `res_x` remain `n` as they are not modified by the loop.
   - `x_solved` and `y_solved` must both be `False` for the loop to continue. If either is `True`, the loop would have already terminated.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - The values of `i` and `j` will increment or reset based on the loop body, but since the loop is iterating through a fixed set of shifts, the key changes are related to whether the loop should continue.

5. **Final State**:
   - Since `x_solved` and `y_solved` must both be `False` for the loop to continue, the new state will reflect this condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `total` is not applicable.
- `i` and `j` are integers within the range `[0, n)`.
- `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map.
- `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `x_solved` is `False`.
- `y_solved` is `False`.

State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are integers within the range `[0, n)`, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False**.
