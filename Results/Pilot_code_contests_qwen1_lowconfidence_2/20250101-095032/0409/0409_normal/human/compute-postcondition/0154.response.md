Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers initially set to 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y)` holds true, and the current value of `(marks[i] + shift_x)` is less than the current value of `(marks[j] + shift_y)`**
