Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `total` is not applicable.
   - `i` and `j` are either 0, 1, or 2.
   - `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map.
   - `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
   - `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`).
   - `x_solved` is `False`.
   - `y_solved` is `False`.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over tuples `(shift_x, shift_y)` in the list `[(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)]`.
   - If `i >= n` or `j >= n`, the loop terminates.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, the loop continues with the current values of `i` and `j`.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0.
   - If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, `i` and `j` are both incremented to 1 or 2, and `marks[i] + shift_x` is outside the range [0, l].

3. **Current State:**
   - Since we don't know the exact values of `i`, `j`, and the specific conditions that were checked, let's consider the possible states after each iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, it must be true that `i < n` and `j < n`.
   - Given the conditions in the loop, if `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, the loop continues with the same `i` and `j`.
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` becomes 1 and `j` becomes 0.
   - If neither condition is met, `i` and `j` are both incremented to 1 or 2.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` and `j` must both be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the only constraint that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `i` and `j` are both less than `n`.

**Final State:**
- `total` is not applicable.
- `i` and `j` are either 0, 1, or 2, but both must be less than `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `mark` remains the last value in the `marks` map.
- `res_y` remains `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `res_x` remains `n` (the length of `marks`).
- `x_solved` remains `False`.
- `y_solved` remains `False`.

**State:**
**`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0, 1, or 2, but both must be less than `n`, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.**
