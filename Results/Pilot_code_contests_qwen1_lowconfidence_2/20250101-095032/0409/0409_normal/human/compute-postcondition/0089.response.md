`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `i`. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement (i >= n or j >= n) is still valid.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `j` is increased by 1; if `i` >= `n` or `j` >= `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
