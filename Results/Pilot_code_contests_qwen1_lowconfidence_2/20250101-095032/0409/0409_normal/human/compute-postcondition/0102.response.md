Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. Either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` holds true.***
