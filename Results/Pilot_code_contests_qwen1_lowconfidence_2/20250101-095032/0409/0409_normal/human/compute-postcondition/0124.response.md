The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1 initially, incrementing `i` by 1 means `i` is now 1 or 2. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 1 or 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
