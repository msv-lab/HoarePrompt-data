The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block but does not affect the values of variables outside of that block. In this case, the `break` statement does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, or `magic_tick` since it is not inside a loop or conditional block that involves these variables.

Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, and `magic_tick` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains the same, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
