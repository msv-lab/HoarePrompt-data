The `break` statement does not change any variable values; it only exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the condition `(marks[0] + shift_x >= marks[0] + shift_y)` still holds true is also preserved.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks` is unchanged, `shift_x` is unchanged, `shift_y` is unchanged, `magic_tick` is `marks[0] + shift_x`, and the condition `(marks[0] + shift_x >= marks[0] + shift_y)` still holds true.**
