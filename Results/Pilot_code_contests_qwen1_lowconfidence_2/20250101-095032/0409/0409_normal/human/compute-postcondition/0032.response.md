Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers that must contain at least one element, `x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `True`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is the key of the next item in the `marks` map, `mark` is the value of the next item in the `marks` map, `res_y` is either 0 or within the range [0, `n - 1`], `res_x` remains unchanged. If `mark + x > l`, the condition `y_solved` remains `True`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
