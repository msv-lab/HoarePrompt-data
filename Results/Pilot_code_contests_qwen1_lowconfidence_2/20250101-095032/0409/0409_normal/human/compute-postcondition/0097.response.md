Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` remains unchanged. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. If at any point `i` or `j` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, the loop or if statement is broken out.***
