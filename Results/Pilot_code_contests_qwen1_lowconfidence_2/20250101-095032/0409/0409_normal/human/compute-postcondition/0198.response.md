Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers such that `0 <= i < n` and `0 <= j < n` (with one of them being equal to `n`). `x_solved` is `True` if there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`. `y_solved` remains `False` unless a valid `mark` is found for `y` in subsequent iterations. `marks`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, and `l` remain unchanged. Additionally, a value of `1` is printed if `magic_tick` is `True`.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block while retaining the conditions stated in the precondition and ensuring that the postcondition reflects the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes.
