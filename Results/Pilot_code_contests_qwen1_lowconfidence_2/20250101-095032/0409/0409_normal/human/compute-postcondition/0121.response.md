The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no such structure in the given initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
