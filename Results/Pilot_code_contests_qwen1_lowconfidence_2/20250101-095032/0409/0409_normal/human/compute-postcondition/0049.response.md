Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers, `x_solved` is a boolean, `y_solved` is a boolean, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `True`, and the if condition `(not x_solved and x_solved)` is evaluated as `False`.***
