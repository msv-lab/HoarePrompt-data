The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead exits the loop or the innermost enclosing block that contains the `break`. Since there is no loop or block structure in the given code snippet that would affect the variables `i` and `j`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that the program will exit the loop or block it was in.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers. Either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or block.**
