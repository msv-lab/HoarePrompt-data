`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged since no operation was performed on it. The precondition that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` still holds true, but now `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated condition is that either the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the same as before, and either `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
