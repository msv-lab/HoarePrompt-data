The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block provided in the code snippet, the only effect of this `break` statement is to indicate that we would exit the current loop or conditional block if one existed. However, since no such structure is present, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `marks[0] + shift_x`, `marks[0] + shift_x` is within the range [0, l]**
