`j` is incremented by 1, which means `j` now holds the value `1 + 0 = 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than 0 or greater than `l`**
