Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers, `magic_tick` is an integer (or undefined). If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains the same, and `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or block. If neither condition is met, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
