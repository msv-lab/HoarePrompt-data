Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers. Either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` is true, then `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `marks` is unchanged, `shift_x` is unchanged, `shift_y` is unchanged, and the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` still holds true. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y` is true, then `i` is 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to `n`. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is true, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks` is unchanged, `shift_x` is unchanged, `shift_y` is unchanged, and `magic_tick` is `marks[0] + shift_x`. Otherwise, `i` is greater than `n` and `j` is 1, and the condition `i >= n` or `j >= n` still holds true.**
