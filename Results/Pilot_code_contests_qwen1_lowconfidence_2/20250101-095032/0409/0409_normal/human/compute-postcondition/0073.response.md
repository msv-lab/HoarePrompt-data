Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and one of the following conditions holds: `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, or `marks[i] + shift_x > l` or `marks[i] + shift_x < 0` holds true.***
