`y_solved` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `y_solved` is now explicitly set to `False`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer read from standard input, `l` is an integer read from standard input, `x` is an integer read from standard input, `y` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `l` is an integer read from standard input, `x` is an integer read from standard input, `y` is an integer read from standard input, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`**
