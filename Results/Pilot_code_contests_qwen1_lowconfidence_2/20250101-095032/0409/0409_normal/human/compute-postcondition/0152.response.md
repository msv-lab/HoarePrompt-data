`j` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `j` was already greater than or equal to `n`, incrementing `j` by 1 does not change the fact that `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y)` is still valid because `j` is only incremented, not `i` or the values of `marks`, `shift_x`, or `shift_y`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y)` is still valid.**
