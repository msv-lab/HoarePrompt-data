Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, `n` is as in the initial state, `marks`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, `l`, and `magic_tick` are as in the initial state. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains the same, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are each incremented by 1, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or block. If neither condition is met, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or block.***
