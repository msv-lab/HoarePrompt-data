`j` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `j` is initially set to 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `j` was incremented from 0, `j` is now 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is greater than `n`, `j` is 1, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
