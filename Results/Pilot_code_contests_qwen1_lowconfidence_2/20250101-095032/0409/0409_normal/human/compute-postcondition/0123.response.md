`j` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `j` is either 0 or 1, incrementing `j` by 1 will make `j` either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, and `j` is either 1 or 2.
