Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, `marks` is a map object of integers that must contain at least one element, `x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `res_x` (where `res_x = bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + x, lo=i, hi=min(res_y + 1, n))`), `mark` is the first value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is unchanged and within the range `[0, n - 1]`, `res_x` is unchanged, and the condition `marks[res_x] == mark + x` holds true.***
