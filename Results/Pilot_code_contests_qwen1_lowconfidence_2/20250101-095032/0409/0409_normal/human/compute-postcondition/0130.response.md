Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. If neither condition is met, `i` and `j` are set to 1 or 2.***
