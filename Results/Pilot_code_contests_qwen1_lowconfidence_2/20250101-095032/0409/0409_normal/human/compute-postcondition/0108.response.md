Postcondition: ***`total` is not applicable, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than `marks[j] + shift_y`***

Explanation: The postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the condition from the if statement. Since the if condition is `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, and given the precondition already states `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than or equal to `marks[j] + shift_y`, the postcondition simply keeps the same values and includes the condition as it is.
