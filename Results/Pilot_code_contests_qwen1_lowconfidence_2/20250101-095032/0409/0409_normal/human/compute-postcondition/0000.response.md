The code `n, l, x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())` reads four integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. The initial states of these variables are as follows:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l.

After executing the code, these variables are updated to the values read from standard input. The other variables (`a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `l` is an integer read from standard input, `x` is an integer read from standard input, `y` is an integer read from standard input, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l.**
