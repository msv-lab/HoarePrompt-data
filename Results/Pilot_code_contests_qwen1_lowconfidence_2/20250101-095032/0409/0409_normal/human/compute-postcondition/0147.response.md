Since the `while True` loop runs indefinitely as long as the loop condition is true (which is always true in this case), no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to run regardless of the current values of `i` and `j`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0**
