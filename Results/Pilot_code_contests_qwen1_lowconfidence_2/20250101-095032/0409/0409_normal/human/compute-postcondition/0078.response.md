`i` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` is either 0 or 1 (now incremented by 1), `j` is either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
