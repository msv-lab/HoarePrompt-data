`magic_tick` is assigned the value `marks[i] + shift_x`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is either 0 or 1, and `shift_x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, `marks[i]` is a value from the `marks` map, and `shift_x` is added to it. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
