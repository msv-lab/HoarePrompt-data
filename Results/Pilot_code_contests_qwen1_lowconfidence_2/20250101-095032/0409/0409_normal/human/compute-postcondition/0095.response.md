Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, no changes occur beyond breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If this condition does not hold, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1, and then we check again whether `i` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, potentially breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
