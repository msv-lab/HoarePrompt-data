Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are integers where `i` and `j` are within the range [0, n), `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `True` or there exists at least one `mark` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True` or `i` and `j` have been updated such that no further iterations can be made (either `i` or `j` is equal to `n`). The final values of `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparisons and increments during the loop iterations.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
- If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is incremented.
- If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `i` is incremented.
- If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, the loop exits via the `break` statement.
- If neither condition for breaking the loop is met, both `i` and `j` are incremented.
- The loop will eventually exit when either `i` or `j` reaches `n`, meaning all possible comparisons have been made. At this point, the values of `i` and `j` indicate the outcome of the loop iterations, and `x_solved` and `y_solved` reflect whether the respective conditions were met during the loop.
