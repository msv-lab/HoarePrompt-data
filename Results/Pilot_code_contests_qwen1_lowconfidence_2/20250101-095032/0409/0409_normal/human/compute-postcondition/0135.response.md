`j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 0 or 1 to either 1 or 2, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1 or 2, `mark` is the last value in the `marks` map, `res_y` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `res_x` is `n` (the length of `marks`), `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`. If `i >= n` or `j >= n`, the condition holds as they are either 0 or 1 or 2. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables' states.**
