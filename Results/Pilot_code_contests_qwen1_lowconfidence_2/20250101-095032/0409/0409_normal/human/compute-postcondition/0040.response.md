Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `marks` is a map object of integers, `x_solved` is a boolean, `y_solved` is a boolean, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is the key of the next item in the `marks` map, `mark` is the value of the next item in the `marks` map, `res_y` is clamped between 0 and `n - 1`, `res_x` is the index where `mark + x` should be inserted to keep `marks` sorted starting from index `i` and up to `min(res_y + 1, n)`, and `res_x` is adjusted to be within the range `[0, n-1]`. If `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, then `y_solved` remains `True`; otherwise, `y_solved` is `True`. `x_solved` remains unchanged.***
