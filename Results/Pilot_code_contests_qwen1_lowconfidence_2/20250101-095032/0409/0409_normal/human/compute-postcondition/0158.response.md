`magic_tick` is assigned the value of `marks[i] + shift_x`. The values of `i`, `j`, `marks`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y` remain unchanged. The condition `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` still holds true.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `marks` is unchanged, `shift_x` is unchanged, `shift_y` is unchanged, `magic_tick` is `marks[0] + shift_x`, and the condition `(marks[0] + shift_x >= marks[0] + shift_y)` still holds true.**
