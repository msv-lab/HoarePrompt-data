Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider all possible scenarios for determining the minimum number of additional marks needed. Let's analyze a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

Expected output:
```
1
230
```

The provided program correctly identifies that adding a mark at 230 cm will allow measuring both 185 cm and 230 cm. However, the program logic does not cover a critical scenario where the marks might not align perfectly with the required distances but still require only one additional mark.

Consider this input:
```
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

The provided program incorrectly outputs `1` and `20` because it checks for the existence of the required distances within the existing marks without considering the possibility that the required distances might already be covered by the existing marks or their combinations.

To correctly handle all cases, the program should ensure that it checks for the presence of both distances directly and consider the possibility that the required distances might already be covered by the existing marks or their combinations. The current logic does not fully cover these scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.
