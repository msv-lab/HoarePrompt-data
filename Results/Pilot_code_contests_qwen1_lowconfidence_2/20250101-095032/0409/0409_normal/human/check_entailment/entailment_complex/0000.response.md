Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional marks needed on the ruler to measure both `x` and `y` distances.
   - The ruler initially has `n` marks at positions specified in the list `marks`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the inputs `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and initializes the list of marks.
   - It then iterates through each mark and checks if the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using existing marks or if additional marks are needed.

3. **Binary Search Utilization**:
   - For each mark, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to check if there are marks at positions `mark + x` and `mark + y`.
   - If a mark at position `mark + x` or `mark + y` is found, it updates the flags `x_solved` and `y_solved` accordingly.

4. **Handling Cases**:
   - If both `x` and `y` are solvable using existing marks, it prints `0`.
   - If only `x` is solvable, it prints `1` and `y`.
   - If only `y` is solvable, it prints `1` and `x`.
   - If neither `x` nor `y` are solvable using existing marks, it enters an additional nested loop to find a new mark that can solve either `x` or `y`.
     - If a valid mark is found, it prints `1` and the position of the new mark.
     - If no valid mark is found, it prints `2` and the pair `(x, y)`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program ensures that it outputs the correct number of additional marks needed and their positions if required.
   - It handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both `x` and `y` distances. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, making it correct.
