Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program fails to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both `x` and `y` distances. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search**: The binary search using `bisect.bisect_left` is not correctly implemented to find the positions where the additional marks should be placed. The indices `res_x` and `res_y` are not correctly calculated to ensure that the distances `x` and `y` can be measured.

2. **Logic Flaws in Determining Solved Conditions**: The program incorrectly checks whether the distances `x` and `y` can be measured. It does not properly handle the cases where the distances cannot be measured with the existing marks and the additional marks needed are not correctly identified.

3. **Incomplete Handling of Additional Mark Calculation**: The logic for determining the minimum number of additional marks and their positions is incomplete. The program does not properly explore all possible scenarios where adding marks might be necessary to measure both `x` and `y`.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the program fails:

- **Initial Checks**: The program checks if `x` and `y` can be measured directly from the existing marks. However, it does not correctly handle cases where these distances cannot be measured directly and additional marks are needed.

- **Shift Calculation**: The shift calculation logic used in the nested `while` loop is not correctly designed to find the optimal positions for the additional marks. The logic for finding `magic_tick` is flawed and does not guarantee the minimum number of additional marks needed.

- **Output Logic**: The output logic does not correctly handle all edge cases. For instance, if neither `x` nor `y` can be measured, the program does not output the correct number of additional marks needed.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to:
1. Check if `x` and `y` can be measured directly with the existing marks.
2. If not, calculate the minimum number of additional marks needed.
3. Ensure the positions of the additional marks are correct.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
