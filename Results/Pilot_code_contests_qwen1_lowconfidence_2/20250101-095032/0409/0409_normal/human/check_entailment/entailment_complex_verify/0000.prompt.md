You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.

Input

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 ≤ pi ≤ l). Number pi means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of pi centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 250 185 230
0 185 250


Output

1
230


Input

4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250


Output

0


Input

2 300 185 230
0 300


Output

2
185 230

Note

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the presence of `x` and `y` distances using binary search. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the case where `x` and `y` are both not present in the initial set of marks but can be derived by adding a single mark.

Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3 300 185 230
0 200 300
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
185 230
```

### Analysis:
- The program initializes `x_solved` and `y_solved` as `False`.
- It iterates through the marks and uses binary search to check if `mark + x` and `mark + y` exist in the list of marks.
- In this specific case, the marks are `[0, 200, 300]`. Neither `185` nor `230` exists in the initial list.
- The program does not correctly identify that adding a mark at `185` would allow measuring `185` and `230`.

The program fails to recognize that adding a single mark at `185` could solve the problem, as it only checks if `mark + x` or `mark + y` exists directly in the list of marks without considering the possibility of creating the required distance by adding a new mark.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Therefore, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` remains `True`, `i` and `j` are integers such that `0 <= i < n` and `0 <= j < n` (with one of them being equal to `n`).

If both `x_solved` and `y_solved` are `True`, the console outputs `0`. Otherwise, if `x_solved` is `True` and `y_solved` is `False`, `y` is printed. If `x_solved` is `False` and `y_solved` is `True`, `1` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts the parameters `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` (an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` (integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` (a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l). The function determines whether there are marks on the ruler at positions `x + a[i]` and `y + a[i]` for any `i` in the range [0, n-1]. If both marks exist, it prints `0`. If only the mark at position `x + a[i]` exists, it prints `1` and the position `y`. If only the mark at position `y + a[i]` exists, it prints `1` and the position `x`. If neither mark exists, it prints `2` and the pair `(x, y)`.

The function iterates through the list of marks and uses binary search to check if the positions `x + a[i]` and `y + a[i]` are occupied. If either of these positions is found, it sets the corresponding flags `x_solved` or `y_solved` to `True`. After the iteration, based on the states of `x_solved` and `y_solved`, it prints the appropriate output.

If neither mark is found, the function enters an additional nested loop to find a position `tick` on the ruler such that `tick + x` or `tick + y` falls within the valid range `[0, l]`. If such a position is found, it prints `1` and the position `tick`. If no valid `tick` is found, it prints `2` and the pair `(x, y)`.

In all cases, the function prints either `0`, `1` followed by a position, or `2` followed by a pair of positions. The final state of the program after the function concludes includes the values of `x_solved`, `y_solved`, and the printed output.
