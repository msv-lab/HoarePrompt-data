The function `func` accepts the parameters `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` (an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` (integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` (a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l). The function determines whether there are marks on the ruler at positions `x + a[i]` and `y + a[i]` for any `i` in the range [0, n-1]. If both marks exist, it prints `0`. If only the mark at position `x + a[i]` exists, it prints `1` and the position `y`. If only the mark at position `y + a[i]` exists, it prints `1` and the position `x`. If neither mark exists, it prints `2` and the pair `(x, y)`.

The function iterates through the list of marks and uses binary search to check if the positions `x + a[i]` and `y + a[i]` are occupied. If either of these positions is found, it sets the corresponding flags `x_solved` or `y_solved` to `True`. After the iteration, based on the states of `x_solved` and `y_solved`, it prints the appropriate output.

If neither mark is found, the function enters an additional nested loop to find a position `tick` on the ruler such that `tick + x` or `tick + y` falls within the valid range `[0, l]`. If such a position is found, it prints `1` and the position `tick`. If no valid `tick` is found, it prints `2` and the pair `(x, y)`.

In all cases, the function prints either `0`, `1` followed by a position, or `2` followed by a pair of positions. The final state of the program after the function concludes includes the values of `x_solved`, `y_solved`, and the printed output.
