The function `func_1` reads three space-separated integers from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input string into individual integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a tuple. The tuple contains the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively. The function does not handle any specific edge cases within the provided code, so it assumes the input always consists of exactly three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this requirement, the function will fail as it relies on the `map` function to convert the split string elements to integers, which would raise a `ValueError` if non-integer values are encountered.
