The function `func_3()` reads a single string from standard input (stdin) and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace or newline characters. There are no additional actions performed by the function. The function accepts no parameters and returns a single string. Potential edge cases include the user providing an empty input or the input containing only whitespace. In such cases, the function will still return a string with no trailing whitespace or newline characters.
