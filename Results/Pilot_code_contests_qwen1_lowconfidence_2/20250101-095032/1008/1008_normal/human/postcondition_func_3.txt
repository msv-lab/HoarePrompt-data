The function `func_4` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the loop completes, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, with `y` being set to 0. This process handles the case where one of the inputs could be 0, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. No other edge cases or missing functionality exist within the given code.
