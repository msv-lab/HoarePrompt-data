The function `func_2()` reads a space-separated sequence of integers from standard input and returns them as a list. The integers represent the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The function assumes that the input consists exactly of three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not conform to this expectation (e.g., fewer or more than three integers), the function will still attempt to parse as many integers as possible, potentially resulting in a list with fewer elements than expected. No error handling is provided for invalid input formats.
