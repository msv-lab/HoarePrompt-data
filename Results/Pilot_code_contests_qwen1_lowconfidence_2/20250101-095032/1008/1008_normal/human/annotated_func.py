#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables' values are explicitly shown in the function signature, but based on the problem description and typical input/output patterns, `func_1` likely returns a tuple of three integers representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively.
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a tuple of three integers representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively, where these values are read from the standard input, stripped, and split into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads three space-separated integers from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input string into individual integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a tuple. The tuple contains the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively. The function does not handle any specific edge cases within the provided code, so it assumes the input always consists of exactly three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this requirement, the function will fail as it relies on the `map` function to convert the split string elements to integers, which would raise a `ValueError` if non-integer values are encountered.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_2()` are provided or explained within the context of the problem description. The function reads input from standard input and returns a list of integers. The input is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers representing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers read from standard input as a space-separated sequence of integers representing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` reads a space-separated sequence of integers from standard input and returns them as a list. The integers represent the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The function assumes that the input consists exactly of three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not conform to this expectation (e.g., fewer or more than three integers), the function will still attempt to parse as many integers as possible, potentially resulting in a list with fewer elements than expected. No error handling is provided for invalid input formats.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are provided in its signature. The function reads input from standard input (stdin) and returns a single string after stripping any trailing whitespace or newline characters.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program reads a single string from standard input (stdin) and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace or newline characters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads a single string from standard input (stdin) and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace or newline characters. There are no additional actions performed by the function. The function accepts no parameters and returns a single string. Potential edge cases include the user providing an empty input or the input containing only whitespace. In such cases, the function will still return a string with no trailing whitespace or newline characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the loop completes, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, with `y` being set to 0. This process handles the case where one of the inputs could be 0, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. No other edge cases or missing functionality exist within the given code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that \(2 \leq 2k \leq n \cdot m\), where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, and k is the number of tubes. However, the provided function does not depend on n, m, or k, and instead uses a helper function func_4(x, y) which is not defined in the given program. Therefore, the exact constraints on x and y cannot be determined from the given information alone.
def func_5(x, y):
    return x * y // func_4(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of x * y divided by func_4(x, y), where func_4(x, y) is an undefined helper function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are positive integers. It returns the result of `x * y` divided by the value returned by the undefined helper function `func_4(x, y)`. Since `func_4` is not defined, this division operation is not guaranteed to produce a valid integer result (i.e., it could lead to a ZeroDivisionError if `func_4(x, y)` returns zero). Additionally, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_4`, we cannot determine the range or nature of the output. The function does not modify any external state; its sole purpose is to compute and return the specified division result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: rows and cols are positive integers such that 2 <= rows, cols <= 300, and 2 <= 2 * k <= rows * cols. k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= (rows * cols) // 2.
def func_6():
    rows, cols, k = func_1()
    curr_x = curr_y = 0
    turn = 0
    store = []

        if not turn:
            for j in range(cols):
                store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
        else:
            for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):

        turn ^= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, and `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, where if `turn` is `False` initially, `j` ranges from 0 to `cols - 1`, and if `turn` is `True` initially, `j` ranges from `cols - 1` to 0.
    i = 0
    count = 0
    while count < k - 1:
        print(2, end=' ')
        
        print(*store[i], end=' ')
        
        print(*store[i + 1])
        
        i += 2
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is `k - 1`, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) where \(i\) and \(j\) satisfy the conditions of the loop, `i` is the final value calculated after the loop, and the printed output consists of `2` followed by pairs of elements from `store`.
    print(rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1), end=' ')
    while i < rows * cols:
        if i == rows * cols - 1:
            print(*store[i])
        else:
            print(*store[i], end=' ')
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is `k - 1`, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) where `i` and `j` satisfy the conditions of the loop, `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, and the printed output is the last element from the list `store` at index `i - 1` followed by a space.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a sequence of coordinates based on the given dimensions of a grid (rows and cols) and a count limit (k). It prints the first k-1 coordinates in a specific pattern and then prints the remaining coordinates in a linear fashion. Specifically, the function first fills a list with coordinate pairs in a zigzag pattern across the grid, starting from (1,1) and alternating direction with each row. After printing the first k-1 pairs, it continues to print the rest of the pairs in a linear order, ensuring that the output respects the specified constraints on rows, cols, and k. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when k is exactly half of the total number of coordinates, leading to a single coordinate being left out in the initial printing phase.
