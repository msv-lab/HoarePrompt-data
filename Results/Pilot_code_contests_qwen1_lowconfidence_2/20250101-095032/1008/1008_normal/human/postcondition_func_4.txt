The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are positive integers. It returns the result of `x * y` divided by the value returned by the undefined helper function `func_4(x, y)`. Since `func_4` is not defined, this division operation is not guaranteed to produce a valid integer result (i.e., it could lead to a ZeroDivisionError if `func_4(x, y)` returns zero). Additionally, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_4`, we cannot determine the range or nature of the output. The function does not modify any external state; its sole purpose is to compute and return the specified division result.
