Postcondition: ***`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` is the number of columns, and `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `cols` if `turn` is not False, otherwise `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each iteration where \(j\) ranges from `cols - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.***
