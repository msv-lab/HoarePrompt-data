The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unknown. The `store` list does not exist in the initial state, so it is initialized here. The values of `rows`, `turn`, and `cols` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is `True`, `cols` must be greater than 0, `store` is `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
