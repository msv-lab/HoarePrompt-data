The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the elements at index `i` of the list `store` separated by a space, but does not assign or modify any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, and `store` is a list; `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < rows * cols`**
