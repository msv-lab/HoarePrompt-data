According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `cols`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `rows`, `turn` is toggled, `store` is a list containing at least one sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, j + 1]`, and `j` is less than `cols`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 so it becomes `j + 1`, but it still needs to be less than `cols`. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to `j + 1`, and the condition `j < cols` must still hold true.

State: **`i` is less than `rows`, `turn` is toggled, `store` is a list containing at least one sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, j + 2]`, `j + 1` is less than `cols`**
