According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `cols - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`.
- `turn` is `False`.
- `cols` must be at least `1`.
- `store` is modified to include a new list with elements `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `cols`. At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the state just before the next iteration starts.

Given that `j` is currently being incremented at each iteration, let's assume `j` was `cols - 1` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be `cols - 1` and then incremented to `cols`.

The other variables (`rows`, `turn`, and `store`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop iterating over `j`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`; `turn` is `False`; `cols` must be at least `1`; `j` is `cols - 1`**.
