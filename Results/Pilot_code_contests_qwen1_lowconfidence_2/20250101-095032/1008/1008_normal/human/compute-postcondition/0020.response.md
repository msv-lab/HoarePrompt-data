Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is `True`, `cols` must be greater than 0, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration of the loop, where `j` starts from `cols - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`rows`**: This variable remains unchanged and stays within the range \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
- **`turn`**: This variable also remains unchanged and is always `True`.
- **`cols`**: This variable is not modified within the loop and must be greater than 0.
- **`store`**: The loop appends pairs of values to the `store` list. Specifically, for each iteration, it appends \([i + 1, j + 1]\), starting with \(j = \text{cols} - 1\) and decrementing \(j\) by 1 until \(j = 0\).

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `store` list will contain all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for \(j\) ranging from \(\text{cols} - 1\) down to 0.

If the loop does not execute (which would be the case if `cols` is not greater than 0), then:
- **`store`**: Will remain an empty list, since no elements are appended to it.

Thus, the final state after all iterations is described as above.
