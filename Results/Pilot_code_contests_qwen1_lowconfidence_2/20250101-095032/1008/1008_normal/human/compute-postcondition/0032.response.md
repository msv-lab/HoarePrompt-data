Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop starts from `cols - 1` and goes down to `-1` in steps of `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop condition is based on the value of `j`, which ranges from `cols - 1` down to `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `cols` must be at least 1 because the loop runs until `j` reaches `-1`. If `cols` were 0, the loop would not run.

3. **Consider the initial values given:**
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
   - `turn` is the original value of `turn`.
   - `cols` is the number of columns used during the loop execution.
   - `store` is an empty list.
   - `turn` is True.

4. **Adjust the states required for the loop to execute:**
   - Since `cols` must be at least 1 for the loop to run, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.
   - The values of `rows`, `turn`, and `store` are not directly involved in the loop condition but are part of the program state.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- `cols` must be at least 1.

The final state after adjustment is:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` must be at least 1, `store` is an empty list, `turn` is True**
