According to the code, the loop iterates over the `cols` variable. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `store` is `[[i + 1, i + 3]]`
- `j` is `i + 2`
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `turn` is the original value of `turn`
- `cols` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1

The loop condition is that `j` should be less than `cols`. Since `j` is currently `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than `cols`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Increment `j`:** Since `j` is currently `i + 2`, the next value of `j` would be `i + 3`.
2. **Check the Loop Condition:** For the loop to continue, `j` (which will be `i + 3`) must be less than `cols`. Therefore, `i + 3 < cols` must hold true.

Given these conditions, we can adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`store` is `[[i + 1, i + 3]]`, `j` is `i + 3`, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time with the updated value of `j`.
