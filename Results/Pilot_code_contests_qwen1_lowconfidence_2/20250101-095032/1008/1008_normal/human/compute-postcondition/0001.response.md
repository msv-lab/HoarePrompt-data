The code initializes `curr_x` and `curr_y` to 0. The values of `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are not affected and are determined by `func_1()`. Therefore, the only variables that are updated are `curr_x` and `curr_y`.

Output State: **`rows` and `cols` are positive integers such that 2 <= rows, cols <= 300 and 2 <= 2 * k <= rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, and `k` is the new value returned by `func_1()`**
