Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop starts from `cols - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop decrements `j` from `cols - 1` to `-1`).

3. **Determine the necessary states to be adjusted:**
   - Since `j` starts at `cols - 1` and the loop decrements, we need to ensure that `j` is at least 0 when the loop starts.
   - The values of `i`, `turn`, and `store` are not directly affecting the condition `j < cols` in this context.

4. **Formulate the required state:**
   - We need to ensure that `j` (which is `cols - 1` initially) is non-negative, i.e., `cols - 1` should be greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Based on the above reasoning, the required states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` will be increased by 1, `turn` will be toggled to the opposite value, `store` updates based on the new value of `turn`, and `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1**
