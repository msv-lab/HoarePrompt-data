Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `store` is a list.
   - `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs as long as `i < rows * cols`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**: 
   - After the increment, `i` is now one more than its previous value.

4. **Determining Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < rows * cols` must still be true.
   - This means that `i + 1 < rows * cols`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `rows * cols`.
   - Therefore, the current value of `i` should be such that when we add 1 to it, it remains less than `rows * cols`.

6. **Final State**:
   - The state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is such that `i + 1 < rows * cols`.

So, the final state should reflect this adjustment:

**State: **`i` is an integer, and `store` is a list; `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < rows * cols`**.
