The given code snippet does not assign any value to any variable or change the state of any existing variables. It simply prints the elements of the list `store` starting from index `i` using the `print` function with `end=' '` to ensure that the elements are printed on the same line separated by a space. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`print(*store[i], end=' ')` is executed and the elements of `store` starting from index `i` are printed on the same line separated by a space.**
