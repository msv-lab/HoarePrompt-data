According to the given code, the loop will iterate based on the variable `rows`. For the loop to execute, `rows` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. The other variables (`curr_x`, `curr_y`, `k`, `turn`, and `store`) do not directly affect whether the loop executes, but they should be consistent with their initial states as specified.

Let's break it down:

1. `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 <= rows <= 300. This condition must be met for the loop to execute.
2. `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 <= cols <= 300. This condition is important but not necessary for the loop to start; it just ensures that the variable is valid.
3. `curr_x` is 0. This is fine as it is.
4. `curr_y` is 0. This is fine as it is.
5. `k` is the new value returned by `func_1()`. This is fine as it is.
6. `turn` is 0. This is fine as it is.
7. `store` is an empty list. This is fine as it is.

The only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `rows`.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 <= rows <= 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 <= cols <= 300, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `k` is the new value returned by `func_1()`, `turn` is 0, and `store` is an empty list**. 

However, since `cols` does not affect the loop execution, we can simplify the answer to focus on `rows`:

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 <= rows <= 300**.
