Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
   - `turn` is now the opposite of its original value.
   - `cols` is the number of columns used during the loop execution.
   - `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, where if `turn` is `False`, `j` ranges from 0 to `cols - 1`, and if `turn` is `True`, `j` ranges from `cols - 1` to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `rows - 1`.
   - During each iteration, `i` takes on values from 0 to `rows - 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken the value `rows - 1` because the loop iterates from 0 to `rows - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will start from 0.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `rows` remains the same as it was not modified inside the loop.
   - `turn` is the opposite of its original value, so it will change to the original value after the next iteration.
   - `cols` remains the same as it was not modified inside the loop.
   - `store` will contain elements for the new `i` values starting from 0.

Given the above analysis, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` starts from 0.
- `turn` will be the original value of `turn` before the loop started.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\); `turn` is the original value of `turn`; `cols` is the number of columns used during the loop execution; `store` is an empty list**.

This is because `i` starts from 0, `turn` returns to its original value, and `store` is reset to an empty list for the new iteration.
