State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 <= rows <= 300, `turn` is False, `cols` must be at least 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `j`**: The loop variable `j` is initialized to 0 in the `range(cols)` function. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `cols` must be at least 1.
   
2. **Variable `turn`**: The initial value of `turn` is given as `False`. This does not directly affect the condition for the loop to execute but might be relevant for other parts of the program logic after the loop.

3. **Variable `rows`**: The value of `rows` is specified as a positive integer between 2 and 300. This is not directly related to the condition for the loop to execute based on the provided for loop structure.

4. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring that `cols` is at least 1. The values of `rows` and `turn` do not need to be explicitly adjusted because they do not impact the basic execution condition of the loop.

Therefore, the required state modification is that `cols` must be at least 1.
