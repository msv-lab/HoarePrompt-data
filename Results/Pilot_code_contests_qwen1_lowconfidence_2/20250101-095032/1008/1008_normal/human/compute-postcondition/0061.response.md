`count` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `count` is now 0, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and the value of `i` is still 0. The precondition that `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\) and `cols` is the number of columns, and `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, is still valid.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, `i` is 0**
