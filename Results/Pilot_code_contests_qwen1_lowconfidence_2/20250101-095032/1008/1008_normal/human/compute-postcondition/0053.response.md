The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given that `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value and `j` must be at least 0, the new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` will be added to `store`. The values of `i` and `j` are updated, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state, so we can only express them in terms of their increments. The `turn` variable is toggled, meaning if it was `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa. The `cols` and the condition that it must be greater than or equal to 1 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `turn` is toggled to the opposite value, `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be at least 0**
