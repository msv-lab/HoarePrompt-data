Postcondition: ***`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\); `turn` is either `False` or `True`; `cols` is the number of columns used during the loop execution; `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, where if `turn` is `False`, `j` ranges from 0 to `cols - 1`, and if `turn` is `True`, `j` ranges from `cols - 1` to 0.***
