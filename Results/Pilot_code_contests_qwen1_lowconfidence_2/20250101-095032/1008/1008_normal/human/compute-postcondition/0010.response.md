Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`.
   - `turn` is `False`.
   - `cols` must be at least `1`.
   - `j` is `cols - 1`.
   - `store` contains the list `[rows, cols]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(cols):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `j` is initialized to `cols - 1` at the start of the first iteration.
   - For each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `j < cols`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` starts at `cols - 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `cols - 1 + 1 = cols`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `j < cols`.
   - After the increment, `j` becomes `cols`, and the condition `cols < cols` is false.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again if `j` reaches `cols`.

6. **Adjust the States for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop does not execute again, the states remain the same as at the end of the last iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`; `turn` is `False`; `cols` must be at least `1`; `j` is `cols` (which was `cols - 1` in the previous iteration); `store` contains the list `[rows, cols]`**.
