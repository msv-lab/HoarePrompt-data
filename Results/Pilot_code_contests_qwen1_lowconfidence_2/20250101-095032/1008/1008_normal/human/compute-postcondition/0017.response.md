The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the variable `store`. Since `j` is defined as `cols - 1`, the value `[i + 1, cols]` is appended to `store`. The variables `rows`, `turn`, and `cols` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is `True`, `cols` must be greater than 0, `store` is `[[i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, cols]]` where `j` is `cols - 1`**
