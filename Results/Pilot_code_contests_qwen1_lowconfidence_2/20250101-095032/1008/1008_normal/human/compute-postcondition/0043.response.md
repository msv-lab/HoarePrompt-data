`store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. The values of `i` and `j` are not provided, so we cannot specify their exact values. However, we know that `i` is less than `rows`. The `turn` variable is toggled, but since no specific value was mentioned for `j`, we cannot determine its value. The `store` variable updates with the new list. 

Output State: **`i` is less than `rows`, `turn` is toggled, `store` is a list containing at least one sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]`, and `j` is an unspecified value.**
