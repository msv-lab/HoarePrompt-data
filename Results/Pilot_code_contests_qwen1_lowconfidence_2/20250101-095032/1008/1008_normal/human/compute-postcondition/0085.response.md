Postcondition: **`count` is `k - 1`, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) where \(i\) and \(j\) satisfy the conditions of the loop, `i` must be less than `rows * cols - 1`, and the printed output is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` followed by a space.**
