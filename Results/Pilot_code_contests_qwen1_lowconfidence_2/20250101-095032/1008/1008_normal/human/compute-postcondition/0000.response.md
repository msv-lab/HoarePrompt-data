The code `rows, cols, k = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, which returns three values: `rows`, `cols`, and `k`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only say that the function returns new values for `rows`, `cols`, and `k` that satisfy the given conditions: `2 <= rows, cols <= 300` and `2 <= 2 * k <= rows * cols`.

Given these conditions, after executing the code:

- `rows` and `cols` are assigned new values within their respective ranges.
- `k` is assigned a new value that satisfies the condition `2 <= 2 * k <= rows * cols`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **rows and cols are positive integers such that 2 <= rows, cols <= 300 and 2 <= 2 * k <= rows * cols, where `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are the new values returned by `func_1()`**.
