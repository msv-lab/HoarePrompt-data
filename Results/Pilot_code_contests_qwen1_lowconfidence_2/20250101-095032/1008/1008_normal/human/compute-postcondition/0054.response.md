Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `turn` is toggled to the opposite value.
   - `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`.
   - `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` must be at least 0.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be within the specified range.
   - Initially, `j` was at some value `j_val` such that `0 ≤ j_val < cols`.
   - After one iteration, `j` is decremented by 1, so `j = j_val - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is decremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j_val - 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `j_val - 1` must still be within the range `[cols - 1, -1]`.
   - Therefore, `cols - 1` should still be greater than or equal to `j_val - 1`, which simplifies to `cols - 1 ≥ j_val - 1` or simply `cols ≥ j_val`.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `i` is already updated as it was increased by 1.
   - `turn` is toggled.
   - `store` now contains one additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]`.
   - `cols` remains the same and must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

- `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
- `turn` is toggled to the opposite value.
- `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`.
- `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` must be at least 1 (since `j` is decremented by 1 from its previous value which was at least 0).

**State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `turn` is toggled to the opposite value, `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be at least 1**
