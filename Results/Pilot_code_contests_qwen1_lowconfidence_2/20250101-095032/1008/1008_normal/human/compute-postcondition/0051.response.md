`store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` adds a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the end of the `store` list. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain as they were before this operation. The operations for increasing `i` by 1, toggling `turn`, and updating `store` based on the new value of `turn` are not directly performed by this line of code. The precondition that `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `turn` is toggled to the opposite value, `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1**
