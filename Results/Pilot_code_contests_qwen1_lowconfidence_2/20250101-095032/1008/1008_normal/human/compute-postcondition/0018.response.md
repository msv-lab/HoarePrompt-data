Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
   - `turn` is `True`.
   - `cols` must be greater than 0.
   - `store` is `[[i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, cols]]` where `j` is `cols - 1`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `cols - 1` to `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been decremented by 1.

3. **Determining the New Value of `j`:**
   - If the loop just completed an iteration, `j` would have been decremented from `cols - 1` to the current value of `j`.
   - Letâ€™s assume `j` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, then at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `k - 1`.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `turn` remains unchanged.
   - `cols` remains unchanged.
   - `store` remains unchanged since it does not depend on the value of `j`.

6. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is decremented by 1 each time, for the next iteration, `j` will be `cols - 2` (assuming `j` was `cols - 1` at the start of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is `True`, `cols` must be greater than 0, `store` is `[[i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, cols]]` where `j` is `cols - 2`**
