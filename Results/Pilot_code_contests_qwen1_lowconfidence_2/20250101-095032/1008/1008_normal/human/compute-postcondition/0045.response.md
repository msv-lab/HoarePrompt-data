`store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. The values of `i`, `turn`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `store` is a list containing at least the original sublist plus the newly appended sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `rows`, `turn` is toggled, `store` is a list containing at least one sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]` and now also contains `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `j` is less than `cols`**
