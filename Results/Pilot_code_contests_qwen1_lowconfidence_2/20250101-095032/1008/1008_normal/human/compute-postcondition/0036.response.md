Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
   - `turn` is the original value of `turn`.
   - `cols` must be at least 1.
   - `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, j + 1]`.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This loop runs from `cols - 1` down to `0`. 

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `j = cols - 1` and decreases `j` by 1 each iteration until `j` reaches 0.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` was reduced by 1 from the starting value.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop decrements `j` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `cols - 2` (one less than the starting value of `j`).
   - The number of columns (`cols`) remains unchanged.
   - The value of `rows` and `turn` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop.
   - The `store` list does not change based on the loop itself; it remains `[i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, j + 1]` but since `j` has decreased by 1, the values inside the list will adjust accordingly if the loop body modifies them.

5. **Final States:**
   - `rows` remains a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
   - `turn` remains the original value of `turn`.
   - `cols` must still be at least 1.
   - `store` will now contain `[i + 1, j], [i + 1, j]` because `j` is now `cols - 2`.

**State:**
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
- `turn` is the original value of `turn`.
- `cols` must be at least 1.
- `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j], [i + 1, j]` where `j` is `cols - 2`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` must be at least 1, `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j], [i + 1, j]` where `j` is `cols - 2**
