The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. Before the code is executed, `store` already contains `[i + 1, j + 2]`. After appending, `store` will contain both `[i + 1, j + 2]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

The values of `i`, `rows`, `turn`, `j`, and `cols` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `rows`, `turn` is toggled, `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, j + 2]`, `j + 1` is less than `cols`**
