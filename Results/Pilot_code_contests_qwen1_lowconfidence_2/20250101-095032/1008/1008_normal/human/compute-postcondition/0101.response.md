Functionality: **The function generates a sequence of coordinates based on the given dimensions of a grid (rows and cols) and a count limit (k). It prints the first k-1 coordinates in a specific pattern and then prints the remaining coordinates in a linear fashion. Specifically, the function first fills a list with coordinate pairs in a zigzag pattern across the grid, starting from (1,1) and alternating direction with each row. After printing the first k-1 pairs, it continues to print the rest of the pairs in a linear order, ensuring that the output respects the specified constraints on rows, cols, and k. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when k is exactly half of the total number of coordinates, leading to a single coordinate being left out in the initial printing phase.**
