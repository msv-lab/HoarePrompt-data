The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Initially, `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements `[j + 1, 1]`, `i` is 2, and `j + 1` has been printed.
