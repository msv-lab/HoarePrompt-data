According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cols`. The loop will execute as long as `cols` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- The value of `turn` is `True`

For the loop to execute, `cols` must be greater than 0. Since the loop iterates from `cols - 1` down to `-1`, `cols` must be at least 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `cols` is at least 1. We do not need to change the value of `rows` or `turn` because they do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is `True`, `cols` must be greater than 0**
