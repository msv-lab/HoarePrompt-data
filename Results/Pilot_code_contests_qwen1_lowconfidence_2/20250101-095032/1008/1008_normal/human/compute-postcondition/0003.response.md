The code initializes an empty list named `store`. This does not affect the values of `rows`, `cols`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `k`, and `turn`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `store` list.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 <= rows <= 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 <= cols <= 300, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `k` is the new value returned by `func_1()`, `turn` is 0, and `store` is an empty list.**
