The code `print(*store[i + 1])` impacts the following:

- It prints the elements of `store[i + 1]`.
- `i` is currently 0, so `store[i + 1]` is `store[1]`.
- The elements in `store` are `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each iteration, meaning `store[1]` will be `[j + 1, i + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `count` is 1.
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value (though the original value is not specified, it is now the opposite).
- `cols` is the number of columns.
- `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration.
- `i` is 0.
- `j + 1` has been printed.

After executing the code:
- The elements of `store[1]` will be printed, which are `[j + 1, i + 1]`. Since `i` is 0, this becomes `[j + 1, 1]`.
- `i` remains 0.
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`count` is 1, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([j + 1, 1]\), `i` is 0, and `j + 1` has been printed.**
