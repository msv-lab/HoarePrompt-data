The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. The variable `i` was previously initialized to 0 if `turn` was `False` and to `cols - 1` if `turn` was `True`. However, since `i` is now explicitly set to 0, this overwrites the previous initialization. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\); `turn` is the opposite of its original value; `cols` is the number of columns; `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration; `i` is 0.**
