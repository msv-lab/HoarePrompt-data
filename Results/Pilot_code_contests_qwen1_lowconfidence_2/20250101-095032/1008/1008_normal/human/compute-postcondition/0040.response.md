The code `turn ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `turn` and 1. This operation toggles the value of `turn` between 0 and 1 (or False and True).

Given the initial conditions:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `turn` is the original value of `turn`
- `cols` is the number of columns
- `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `cols` if `turn` is not False, otherwise `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each iteration where \(j\) ranges from `cols - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`

Since the only affected variable is `turn`, its value will be toggled. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `turn` was originally `False` (0):
   - After `turn ^= 1`, `turn` becomes `True` (1).
   
2. If `turn` was originally `True` (1):
   - After `turn ^= 1`, `turn` becomes `False` (0).

Therefore, the `store` list remains unchanged because the condition for its creation does not depend on the value of `turn` after the operation.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is toggled to the opposite value, `cols` is the number of columns, and `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `cols` if `turn` is not False, otherwise `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each iteration where \(j\) ranges from `cols - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.**
