`store` is a list that contains `[i + 1, j + 1]`. The code appends another list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`. Since `j` is `cols - 2`, the appended list is the same as the existing list in `store`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the updated `store`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` must be at least 1, `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, j + 1]`**, `j` is `cols - 2`.
