The code `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2. The initial state mentions that `i` is increased by 2, which means `i` was already 2 more than its original value before this line of code. Since `i` was already increased by 2, incrementing it by 2 again will make `i` 4 more than its original value.

The other variables (`count`, `count + 1`, and `k - 1`) remain unchanged because the code only affects `i`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` is increased by 2 (which means it is now 4 more than its original value)
- `count` is increased by 1
- `count + 1` must be less than `k - 1`

Output State: **`i` is increased by 4, `count` is 2, `count + 1` is less than `k - 1`**
