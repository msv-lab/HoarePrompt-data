`store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the existing list `store`. Since `i` and `j` are not defined in the initial state and no values are provided for them, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `i` and `j` refer to the current row and column indices during the iteration of a loop, and they are derived from `rows` and `cols`.

Given the initial state:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`
- `turn` is `False`
- `cols` must be at least `1`
- `j` is `cols` (which was `cols - 1` in the previous iteration)
- `store` contains the list `[rows, cols]`

Since `i` and `j` are not explicitly defined, we cannot specify their exact values. But we can represent the new list added to `store` as `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`; `turn` is `False`; `cols` must be at least `1`; `j` is `cols`; `store` contains the lists `[rows, cols]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
