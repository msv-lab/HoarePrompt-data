The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state:

- `store` is `[[i + 1, j + 1]]`
- `j` is `i + 2`
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `turn` is the original value of `turn`
- `cols` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1

After executing `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])`, the updated `store` will contain two lists: the initial list and the newly appended list.

- The initial list in `store` remains `[[i + 1, j + 1]]`.
- The newly appended list is `[i + 1, j + 1]`, which is equivalent to `[i + 1, (i + 2) + 1]` or `[i + 1, i + 3]`.

Therefore, the updated `store` is `[[i + 1, i + 3]]`.

The states of the other variables (`j`, `rows`, `turn`, `cols`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`store` is `[[i + 1, i + 3]]`, `j` is `i + 2`, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
