`turn` is toggled using the XOR operation with 1. This means if `turn` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `turn` was `False`, it becomes `True`. The values of `i`, `rows`, `store`, and `cols` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `rows`, `turn` is toggled, and `store` contains a list of sublists where each sublist is `[i + 1, j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `0` to `cols - 1`. If `not turn` (i.e., the if part), `store` is a list of sublists as described above. If the else part is executed, `i` is increased by 1, `turn` is toggled, and `store` contains a list of all elements generated by the loop, with each element being `[i + 1, j + 1]` where `j` starts from `cols - 1` and decrements to `0`. After executing `turn ^= 1`, `turn` is toggled.**
