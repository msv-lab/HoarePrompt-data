Postcondition: ***`count` is `k - 1`, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) where `i` and `j` satisfy the conditions of the loop, and the printed output is either `[rows * cols, j + 1]` if `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, or the first two elements from the list `store` at index `i` otherwise.***
