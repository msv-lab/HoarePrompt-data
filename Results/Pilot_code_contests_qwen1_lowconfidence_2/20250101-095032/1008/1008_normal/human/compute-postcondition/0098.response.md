The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the precondition, `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < rows * cols`. This means that after incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be one more than its original value, and it will still satisfy the condition `i + 1 < rows * cols`.

The states of the other variables (`store` and the condition regarding `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer equal to its original value plus 1, and `store` is a list; i + 1 < rows * cols.**
