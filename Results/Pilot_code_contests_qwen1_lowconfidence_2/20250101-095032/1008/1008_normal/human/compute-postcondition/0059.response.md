Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, and `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, where if `turn` is `False` initially, `j` ranges from 0 to `cols - 1`, and if `turn` is `True` initially, `j` ranges from `cols - 1` to 0.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `rows` is a positive integer between 2 and 300.
   - `cols` is a positive integer between 2 and 300.
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `k` is the result of `func_1()`.
   - `turn` is 0 (initially false).
   - `store` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs `rows` times.
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, `i` takes the value from 0 to `rows - 1`.
   - Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop that runs `cols` times if `turn` is `False` and `cols - 1` times in reverse order if `turn` is `True`.
   - During each iteration of the inner loop, the pair \([i + 1, j + 1]\) is appended to the `store` list.

3. **After All Iterations**:
   - The `turn` variable will be the opposite of its initial value because `turn ^= 1` toggles the value of `turn` at each iteration of the outer loop.
   - The `store` list will contain all pairs \([i + 1, j + 1]\) generated during the loop executions. If `turn` was initially `False`, `j` will range from 0 to `cols - 1`, and if `turn` was initially `True`, `j` will range from `cols - 1` to 0 for each `i` from 0 to `rows - 1`.

4. **State of Other Variables**:
   - `rows`, `cols`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `k` do not change during the loop and retain their initial values.

Therefore, after the loop has finished executing all iterations, the final state of the variables will be as stated above.
