The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the elements of the list `store[i]` separated by a space, without a newline at the end. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `store` or the index `i`. We know from the precondition that `printed output is '2 2 '`, `i` is increased by 2, `count` is increased by 1, and `count + 1` must be less than `k - 1`.

Given the initial printed output `'2 2'`, we can infer that `store[i]` was `[2, 2]` before the print statement. After executing the print statement, the elements of `store[i]` (which are 2 and 2) are printed, resulting in the same output.

The impact of the code on the program includes:
- The elements of `store[i]` are printed, which results in the output `'2 2 '`.
- The variable `i` is increased by 2.
- The variable `count` is increased by 1.
- The condition `count + 1 < k - 1` remains true.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **printed output is '2 2 ', `i` is increased by 2, `count` is increased by 1, and `count + 1` must be less than `k - 1**.
