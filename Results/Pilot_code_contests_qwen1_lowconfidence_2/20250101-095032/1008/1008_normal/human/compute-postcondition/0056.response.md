Output State: **`i` is increased by 1 from its initial value, `turn` is toggled to the opposite value each iteration, `store` contains a list of all elements generated by the loop, with each element being `[i + 1, j + 1]` where `j` starts from `cols - 1` and decrements to `0`, `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each value of `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to `0`.
- For each iteration, `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` adds a new element to the `store` list.
- Since the loop runs for every `j` from `cols - 1` to `0`, the `store` list will contain all pairs `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each `j`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after the loop, and `turn` is toggled to the opposite value each time the loop runs.
- The condition `i < rows` must hold true for the loop to execute all its iterations.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `cols` is 0), then:
- `i` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `turn` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `store` remains an empty list.
- `cols` must be 0.
