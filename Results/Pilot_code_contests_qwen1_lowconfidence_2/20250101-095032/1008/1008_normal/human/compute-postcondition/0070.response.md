The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the `store` list followed by a space, but it does not change any variables. The initial state mentions that the printed output is '2 ', which implies that the element at index `i` of the `store` list is '2'. However, since no specific value for `i` is given, we cannot determine the exact state of `i`.

Given the information, the only change is in the printed output, which is '2 '.

Output State: **printed output is '2 '**
