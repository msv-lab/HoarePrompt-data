Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, and `store` is a list. If `i` equals `rows * cols - 1`, then the elements of `store` starting from index `i` are printed on a new line. Otherwise, the elements of `store` starting from index `i` are printed on the same line separated by spaces. The values of `i` and `store` remain unchanged after the print operation.***
