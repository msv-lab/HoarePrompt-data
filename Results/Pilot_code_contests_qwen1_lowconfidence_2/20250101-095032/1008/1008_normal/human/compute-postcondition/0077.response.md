The code `print(*store[i + 1])` impacts the program by printing the elements of the list `store` starting from index `i + 1`. Since the initial state mentions that `printed output is '2 2'`, it implies that `store[i + 1]` contains the elements `[2, 2]` and the print statement is correctly printing these elements. However, the values of `i` and `count` are not directly altered by this line of code, only the printed output changes.

Given the initial conditions:
- Printed output is '2 2'
- `i` is increased by 2
- `count` is increased by 1
- `count + 1` must be less than `k - 1`

After executing the code, the printed output will be '2 2' because the print statement does not modify the variables `i` or `count` but rather prints the elements of `store[i + 1]`.

The output state remains the same in terms of the values of `i` and `count`, but the printed output has already been updated by the print statement.

Output State: **printed output is '2 2', `i` is increased by 2, `count` is increased by 1, and `count + 1` must be less than `k - 1**
