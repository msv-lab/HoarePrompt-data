The variable `turn` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `rows`, `cols`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 <= rows <= 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 <= cols <= 300, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `k` is the new value returned by `func_1()`, and `turn` is 0.**
