The code snippet `print(*store[i])` has the following impacts:

1. It prints the elements of the list `store` starting from index `i` using the unpacking operator `*`.
2. No new variables are defined or modified.
3. The value of `i` and the contents of `store` are used but not altered.

Since the code does not modify any variables or add new ones, the only thing affected is the output, which is printing the elements of `store` starting from index `i`. However, the initial state variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`print(*store[i])` is executed, printing the elements of `store` starting from index `i`. The values of `i` and `store` remain unchanged.**
