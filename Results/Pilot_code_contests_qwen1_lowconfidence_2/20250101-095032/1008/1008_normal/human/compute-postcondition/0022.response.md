The code `turn ^= 1` toggles the value of `turn` between `False` and `True`. Given the initial conditions, if `turn` was `False`, it will become `True`, and if `turn` was `True`, it will become `False`. The values of `rows`, `cols`, and the list `store` remain unchanged.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `turn` was initially `False`, it will become `True`.
2. If `turn` was initially `True`, it will become `False`.

In both cases, the other variables (`rows`, `cols`, and `store`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\); `turn` is now the opposite of its original value (either `True` if originally `False` or `False` if originally `True`); `cols` is the number of columns used during the loop execution; `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, where if `turn` is `False`, `j` ranges from 0 to `cols - 1`, and if `turn` is `True`, `j` ranges from `cols - 1` to 0.**
