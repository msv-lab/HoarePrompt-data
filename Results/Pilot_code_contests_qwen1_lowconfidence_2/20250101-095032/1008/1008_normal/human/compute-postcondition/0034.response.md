According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `cols - 1` down to `0`. The state at the end of the previous iteration provides us with the following information:

- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `turn` is the original value of `turn`
- `cols` must be at least 1
- `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]`
- `turn` is `True`

The loop iterates over `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the new state for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` would have been decremented by 1.
- For the loop to continue, `j` must still be in the range from `0` to `cols - 2`.

Given this, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `j` must now be `cols - 2`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` should still be non-negative and within the bounds of `cols - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` must be at least 1, `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2`**
