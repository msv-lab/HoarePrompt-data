The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. But we know that `store` is being modified.

The initial state includes:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`
- `turn` is `False`
- `cols` must be at least `1`

Since the values of `i` and `j` are not specified, we cannot provide their exact values. We only know that `store` is now modified to include a new list with elements `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`; `turn` is `False`; `cols` must be at least `1`; `store` is modified to include a new list with elements `i + 1` and `j + 1`.**
