`store` is an empty list, and the code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`. Since `i` and `j` are not defined in the initial state, they are assumed to be placeholders. However, we know that `store` will now contain one new list with the values `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

The states of the other variables (`rows`, `turn`, `cols`) are not affected.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` must be at least 1, `store` is a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `turn` is True**
