The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a list containing `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. Since `i` and `j` are not defined in the initial state, they are assumed to be local variables within the scope where this line of code is executed. However, their specific values are not given, so we can only say that a new list with elements `[i + 1, j + 1]` is added to `store`.

The initial state of `store` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `store` will contain one additional element, which is the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`store` is `[[i + 1, j + 1]]`, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
