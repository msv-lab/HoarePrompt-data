According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range specified by `cols`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `cols`.

At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `i` is less than `rows`
- `turn` is toggled
- `store` is a list containing at least one sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]`
- `j` is an unspecified value

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `cols`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`. Therefore, the new condition for `j` is that it must be less than `cols`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is less than `rows`, `turn` is toggled, `store` is a list containing at least one sublist `[i + 1, j + 1]`, and `j` is less than `cols`**
