Output State: **`store` is a list of lists where each inner list contains `[i + 1, j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `cols`, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` is the number of columns used during the loop execution, and `i` is `rows - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `cols` and appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list for each iteration.
- After the loop completes, `store` will contain all the pairs `[i + 1, j + 1]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `cols - 1`.
- Since the loop runs `cols` times, the final value of `i` will be `rows - 1` because `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` for each iteration, and the loop runs `cols` times.
- The value of `rows` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `turn` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `cols` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is described as above.
