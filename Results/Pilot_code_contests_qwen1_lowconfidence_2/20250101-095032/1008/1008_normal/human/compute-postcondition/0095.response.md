The code `print(*store[i])` will print the elements of the list `store` at index `i`. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `i` or `store`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, and `store` is a list; `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < rows * cols`**
