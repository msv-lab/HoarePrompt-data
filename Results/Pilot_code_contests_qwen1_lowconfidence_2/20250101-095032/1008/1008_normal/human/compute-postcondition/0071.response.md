The code `print(*store[i + 1])` attempts to print elements from the list `store` starting from index `i + 1`. However, the initial state only mentions that the printed output is '2 ', which does not provide information about the `store` list or the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state cannot be determined without additional information.

Output State: **printed output is '2 ', the state of `store` and `i` is unknown**
