Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `turn` is toggled to the opposite value.
   - `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`.
   - `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **For Loop Details:**
   ```python
   for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to `0`.
   - On each iteration, `j` decreases by 1.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Since the loop is iterating backwards, `j` will now be one less than it was in the previous iteration.
   - The variable `cols` remains unchanged as it does not participate in the loop's control.
   - The state of `i` and `turn` also remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's condition.

5. **New States for Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is still increased by 1 from its previous value (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `turn` is still toggled to the opposite value (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `store` now contains an additional element `[i + 1, j + 1]`, where `j` is one less than in the previous iteration.
   - `cols` remains the same as it did in the previous iteration.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `j` must be at least 0 for the loop to continue (since `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)` starts from `cols - 1` and goes down to 0).

So, the new state for the next iteration is:
- `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
- `turn` is toggled to the opposite value.
- `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`, where `j` is one less than in the previous iteration.
- `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` must be at least 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `turn` is toggled to the opposite value, `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be at least 0**
