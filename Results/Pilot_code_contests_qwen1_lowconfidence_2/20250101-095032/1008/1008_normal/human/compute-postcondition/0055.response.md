The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `store` contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`. The values of `total`, `i`, `turn`, and `cols` remain unchanged. The value of `j` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `turn` is toggled to the opposite value, `store` contains two elements, with the second element being `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be at least 1**
