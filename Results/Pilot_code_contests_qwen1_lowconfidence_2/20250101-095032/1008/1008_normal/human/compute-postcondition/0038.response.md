Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `turn` is the original value of `turn`, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration where \(j\) ranges from `cols - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`, `turn` is True.**

### Explanation:
- **`rows`**: This remains unchanged as it is only provided as a constraint and does not change within the loop.
- **`turn`**: This also remains unchanged as it is mentioned to be the original value and does not change within the loop.
- **`cols`**: This represents the number of columns used during the loop execution. It must be at least 1.
- **`store`**: The loop appends a list \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each value of `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to `-1`. After all iterations, `store` will contain a list of such pairs for every column.
- **`turn`**: As mentioned, this remains the original value.

Since the loop runs for `cols` times (once for each column from `cols - 1` to `0`), `store` will end up being a list of lists where each inner list is \([i + 1, j + 1]\).
