Let's go through this step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `store` is `[[i + 1, i + 3]]`
   - `j` is `i + 3`
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
   - `turn` is the original value of `turn`
   - `cols` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the existing `store`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `store` gets updated by appending a new list. The new list is `[i + 1, j + 1]`. Since `j` is already defined as `i + 3`, the new list becomes `[i + 1, (i + 3) + 1]` which simplifies to `[i + 1, i + 4]`.
   - No other variables are affected.

4. **Output State**:
   - `store` now contains two lists: `[[i + 1, i + 3], [i + 1, i + 4]]`.
   - `j` remains `i + 3`.
   - `rows`, `turn`, and `cols` retain their original values.

Output State: **`store` is [[i + 1, i + 3], [i + 1, i + 4]]; `j` is i + 3; `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\); `turn` is the original value of `turn`; `cols` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.**
