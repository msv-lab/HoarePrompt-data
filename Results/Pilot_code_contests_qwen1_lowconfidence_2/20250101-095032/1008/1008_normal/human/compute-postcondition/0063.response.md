The code `print(2, end=' ')` simply prints the number 2 followed by a space without moving to the next line. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each iteration, `i` is 0**
