The code `print(*store[i])` prints the elements of the list stored in `store[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`. Since `store` is a list containing the elements `[i + 1, j + 1]` where `i` and `j` satisfy the conditions of the loop, and `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, the element at `store[i]` will be the last element of the list, which is `[rows * cols, j + 1]`.

The print statement will output the elements of this list, but since the exact value of `j` is not given, we keep it as a symbolic representation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is `k - 1`, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `cols` is the number of columns, `store` is a list containing the elements \([i + 1, j + 1]\) where `i` and `j` satisfy the conditions of the loop, `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, and the printed output is `[rows * cols, j + 1]`.**
