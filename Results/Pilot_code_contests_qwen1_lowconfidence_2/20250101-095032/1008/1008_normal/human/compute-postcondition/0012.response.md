Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`; `turn` is `False`; `cols` is the number of columns used during the loop execution; `store` is a list containing lists `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each iteration where `0 <= i < rows` and `0 <= j < cols`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `cols`, which means it will create a list `store` containing lists of pairs `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each combination of `i` and `j` within the specified range.
- Since the loop runs for each column `j` in `range(cols)`, the final value of `j` will be `cols - 1` if the loop completes all its iterations.
- The variable `store` will contain all the pairs generated during the loop execution, which means it will have `rows * cols` entries.
- The variable `turn` remains `False` because there is no code in the loop that would change its value.
- The variable `cols` is determined by the condition under which the loop runs. If the loop completes, `cols` will be the number of columns it iterated over.

Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, the values of the variables will be as described above.
