The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `i` must be `rows - 1` because `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` implies that `i` and `j` are the indices being used. Therefore, `i + 1` would be `rows` and `j + 1` would be `cols`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that `2 <= rows <= 300`; `turn` is `False`; `cols` must be at least `1`; `j` is `cols - 1`; `store` contains the list `[rows, cols]`**
