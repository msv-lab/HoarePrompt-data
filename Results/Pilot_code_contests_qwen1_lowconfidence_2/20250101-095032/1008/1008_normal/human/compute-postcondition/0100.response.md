The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle the constraints where `rows` and `cols` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq rows, cols \leq 300\) and \(2 \leq 2k \leq rows \times cols\). Additionally, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq \frac{rows \times cols}{2}\).

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but enforces constraints on rows, cols, and k such that \(2 \leq rows, cols \leq 300\) and \(2 \leq 2k \leq rows \times cols\) with \(1 \leq k \leq \frac{rows \times cols}{2}\).**
