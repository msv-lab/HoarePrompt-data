Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires arranging exactly `k` tubes on a rectangle table such that no two tubes share any cells and every cell on the table is part of exactly one tube. However, the provided solution does not ensure that all cells are covered and does not guarantee that the tubes do not overlap. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 3
```
The output provided by the program is:
```
3 1 1 1 2 1 3
3 2 1 2 2 2 3
3 3 1 3 2 3 3
```
This output is incorrect because it tries to create tubes with more than 3 cells, which violates the condition that each tube must have at least 2 cells and the total number of cells used must be exactly `2k`. In this case, the tubes are over-defined and do not meet the requirement of using exactly `2k` cells without overlap.

A correct solution would ensure that each tube has exactly 2 cells and covers all cells in a non-overlapping manner. The provided code does not enforce these constraints properly.
