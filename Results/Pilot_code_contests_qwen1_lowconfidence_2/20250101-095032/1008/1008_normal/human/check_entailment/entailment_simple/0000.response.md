Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`), but only `func_6` is relevant to the problem at hand. The other functions are either unnecessary or incorrectly defined and used.
   
2. **Problem Description and Implementation**:
   - According to the problem, Valera needs to place exactly `k` tubes on an `n x m` table such that each tube is a sequence of cells forming a path where each step changes the row or column by exactly 1, and no two tubes share any cells. Additionally, all cells of the table should belong to exactly one tube.
   - The function `func_6` attempts to generate the tubes, but the implementation is flawed.

3. **Flawed Implementation**:
   - The variable `store` is initialized with coordinates of cells in a zigzag manner (first row from left to right, then the next row from right to left). This is a valid approach to cover the entire table, but the subsequent logic for generating tubes is incorrect.
   - The logic inside the `while` loop for generating the tubes is flawed. Specifically:
     - The loop iterates over `k-1` tubes and prints each tube as a pair of coordinates.
     - After printing `k-1` tubes, the code tries to print the remaining cells, but the logic is incorrect and does not ensure that all cells are covered without overlap.
   - The final `print` statement is trying to cover the remaining cells but does not properly account for the tubes already printed and does not guarantee that all cells are covered without overlap.

### Example of Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve generating a covering pattern for the tubes that ensures no cells are shared between tubes and all cells are covered. One possible correct approach could involve alternating the direction of the tubes (e.g., one tube going from top-left to bottom-right, the next from bottom-right to top-left, and so on).

Given the above issues, the current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct.
