Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic for arranging tubes on the rectangle table as described. The program iterates through the rows and alternates between filling the columns from left to right and from right to left. This ensures that each tube is placed without overlapping and that all cells are covered by exactly one tube. Since the problem guarantees that at least one solution exists, and the program generates a valid arrangement for the given constraints, it meets the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
