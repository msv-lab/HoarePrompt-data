You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valera has got a rectangle table consisting of n rows and m columns. Valera numbered the table rows starting from one, from top to bottom and the columns – starting from one, from left to right. We will represent cell that is on the intersection of row x and column y by a pair of integers (x, y).

Valera wants to place exactly k tubes on his rectangle table. A tube is such sequence of table cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xr, yr), that: 

  * r ≥ 2; 
  * for any integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ r - 1) the following equation |xi - xi + 1| + |yi - yi + 1| = 1 holds; 
  * each table cell, which belongs to the tube, must occur exactly once in the sequence. 



Valera thinks that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * no pair of tubes has common cells; 
  * each cell of the table belongs to some tube. 



Help Valera to arrange k tubes on his rectangle table in a fancy manner.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300; 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of tubes, correspondingly. 

Output

Print k lines. In the i-th line print the description of the i-th tube: first print integer ri (the number of tube cells), then print 2ri integers xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2, ..., xiri, yiri (the sequence of table cells).

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads three space-separated integers from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input string into individual integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a tuple. The tuple contains the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively. The function does not handle any specific edge cases within the provided code, so it assumes the input always consists of exactly three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this requirement, the function will fail as it relies on the `map` function to convert the split string elements to integers, which would raise a `ValueError` if non-integer values are encountered.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` reads a space-separated sequence of integers from standard input and returns them as a list. The integers represent the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The function assumes that the input consists exactly of three integers separated by spaces. If the input does not conform to this expectation (e.g., fewer or more than three integers), the function will still attempt to parse as many integers as possible, potentially resulting in a list with fewer elements than expected. No error handling is provided for invalid input formats.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` reads a single string from standard input (stdin) and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace or newline characters. There are no additional actions performed by the function. The function accepts no parameters and returns a single string. Potential edge cases include the user providing an empty input or the input containing only whitespace. In such cases, the function will still return a string with no trailing whitespace or newline characters.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the loop completes, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, with `y` being set to 0. This process handles the case where one of the inputs could be 0, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. No other edge cases or missing functionality exist within the given code.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(x, y):
    return x * y // func_4(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are positive integers. It returns the result of `x * y` divided by the value returned by the undefined helper function `func_4(x, y)`. Since `func_4` is not defined, this division operation is not guaranteed to produce a valid integer result (i.e., it could lead to a ZeroDivisionError if `func_4(x, y)` returns zero). Additionally, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_4`, we cannot determine the range or nature of the output. The function does not modify any external state; its sole purpose is to compute and return the specified division result.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (rows, cols, k) = func_1()
    curr_x = curr_y = 0
    turn = 0
    store = []
    for i in range(rows):
        if not turn:
            for j in range(cols):
                store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
        else:
            for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
                store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
        turn ^= 1
    i = 0
    count = 0
    while count < k - 1:
        print(2, end=' ')
        print(*store[i], end=' ')
        print(*store[i + 1])
        i += 2
        count += 1
    print(rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1), end=' ')
    while i < rows * cols:
        if i == rows * cols - 1:
            print(*store[i])
        else:
            print(*store[i], end=' ')
        i += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function generates a sequence of coordinates based on the given dimensions of a grid (rows and cols) and a count limit (k). It prints the first k-1 coordinates in a specific pattern and then prints the remaining coordinates in a linear fashion. Specifically, the function first fills a list with coordinate pairs in a zigzag pattern across the grid, starting from (1,1) and alternating direction with each row. After printing the first k-1 pairs, it continues to print the rest of the pairs in a linear order, ensuring that the output respects the specified constraints on rows, cols, and k. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when k is exactly half of the total number of coordinates, leading to a single coordinate being left out in the initial printing phase.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
