Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not ensure that no pair of tubes has common cells. The code generates a zigzag pattern and prints the first \(k-1\) tubes in pairs, followed by the remaining cells in a linear fashion. This approach does not guarantee that each cell belongs to exactly one tube and that no cells are shared between different tubes.

For example, consider a \(3 \times 3\) grid with \(k = 3\):

- The zigzag pattern will generate the following sequence: \((1,1), (1,3), (3,3), (3,1), (2,1), (2,3)\).
- The first tube could be \((1,1), (1,3)\), the second tube could be \((3,3), (3,1)\), and the third tube could be \((2,1), (2,3)\).

This example works, but consider a more complex scenario where the tubes need to be arranged in a way that ensures no overlap and each cell is used exactly once. The provided code does not handle this requirement, as it simply prints the cells in a zigzag pattern and then in a linear fashion, without ensuring the tubes do not share cells.

Therefore, the code fails to meet the problem description's requirement that no pair of tubes should have common cells, making it incorrect.
