x and y are positive integers such that \(2 \leq 2k \leq n \cdot m\), where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, and k is the number of tubes. However, the provided function does not depend on n, m, or k, and instead uses a helper function func_4(x, y) which is not defined in the given program. Therefore, the exact constraints on x and y cannot be determined from the given information alone.
