`x` is assigned the value of the second element in the list `L`. The first element of the list `L` is equal to `n`, which means `n = L[0]`. The value of `x` is now the integer represented by the second part of the input string split into integers.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `n` is equal to the first element of the list `L`; `x` is equal to the second element of the list `L`.**
