Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to the first element of the list `L`, `x` is equal to the second element of the list `L`, `res` is as previously calculated plus either 2 times `q` times `b` or `2 * x` (depending on whether `a > b` or not), `a` is equal to `x - (x // b) * b` or `x`, `b` is adjusted accordingly based on the condition `a > b`, and `flag` is `True` if `b > a` holds, otherwise `flag` is `False`.***
