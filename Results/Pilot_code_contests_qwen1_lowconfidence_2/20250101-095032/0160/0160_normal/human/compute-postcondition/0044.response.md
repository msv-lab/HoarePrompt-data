Output State: **`n` is the first element of the list `L`, `x` is the second element of the list `L`, `res` is the final result obtained by repeatedly applying the loop operations until `a` equals `b`, `a` is `0`, `b` is `0`, and `flag` is `False`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `flag` is `True`.
- Each iteration of the loop either reduces `a` and increases `res` by `2 * q * b` or reduces `b` and increases `res` by `2 * a * q` or simply adds `a` to `res` and sets `flag` to `False`.
- Since `a` and `b` are adjusted in each iteration based on the conditions, eventually `a` and `b` will become equal and `flag` will be set to `False`.
- At this point, `a` and `b` will both be `0` because the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `x` will be found, and the process of reducing `a` and `b` will continue until they both reach `0`.
- The value of `res` will be the sum of all the adjustments made during the iterations, which effectively computes the expression `n + 2 * (x * (n // x)) - 2 * (x * (n // x) % x)` if `a` was initially greater than `b` and `n - x` otherwise.
