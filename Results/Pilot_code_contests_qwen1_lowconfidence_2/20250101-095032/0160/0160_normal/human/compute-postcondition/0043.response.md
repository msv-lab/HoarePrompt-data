Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of the list \( L \), `x` is the second element of the list \( L \), `res` is the previously calculated value plus either `2 * q * b` or `2 * a` depending on whether `a > b` or `b > a`, `a` is \( x - (x // b) * b \) or \( x \% b \), `b` is adjusted accordingly based on the condition `a > b`, and `flag` is `True` if `b > a` and `False` otherwise.***
