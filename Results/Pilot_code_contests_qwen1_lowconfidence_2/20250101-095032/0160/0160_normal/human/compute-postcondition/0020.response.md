Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\), `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\), `n` is equal to the first element of the list `L`, `x` is equal to the second element of the list `L`, `res` is either `n + 2 * x * ((n - x) // x)` or `n + x` depending on whether `b > a` is true or false, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is adjusted accordingly as `b - (n - x)` if `b > a` or remains `n - x`, `flag` is `True` if `b > a` and `False` otherwise.***
