Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\), `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\), `n` is equal to the first element of the list `L`, `x` is equal to the second element of the list `L`, `res` is equal to `n`, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `n - x`, `flag` is `True`, and the current value of `a` is greater than `b`**
