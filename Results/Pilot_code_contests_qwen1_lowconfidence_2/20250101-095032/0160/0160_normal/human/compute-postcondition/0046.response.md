The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameter constraints and relationships are provided separately but do not influence the function definition itself. The function's behavior is not specified in the given code snippet.

Given the output cases, we can infer the following:

- There are no input parameters for the function.
- The function may involve some computation or logic based on the constraints provided (N and X), but these details are not present in the function definition.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not return anything based on the provided constraints and relationships.**
