`n` is assigned the value of `L[0]`, which is the first element of the list `L`. The values of `N` and `X` remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the conditions of the initial state for `N` and `X`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `n` is equal to the first element of the list `L`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.**
