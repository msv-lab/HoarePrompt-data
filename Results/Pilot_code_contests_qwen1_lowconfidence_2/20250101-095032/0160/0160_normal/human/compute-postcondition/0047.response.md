Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( x \) from the standard input where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{12} \) and \( 1 \leq x \leq n-1 \). It then calculates the value of \( res \) by repeatedly applying a series of operations based on the values of \( a \) and \( b \), which are initially set to \( x \) and \( n-x \) respectively. The operations involve updating \( a \) and \( b \) using the floor division and subtraction, and updating \( res \) accordingly. The loop continues until \( a \) equals \( b \). Finally, the function prints the value of \( res \). The function does not return any value. An edge case to consider is when \( n \) is very large (up to \( 10^{12} \)), the function may take a significant amount of time to execute due to the iterative process. Additionally, if \( n \) or \( x \) do not meet the specified constraints, the function assumes default values without any error handling.**

**Potential missing functionality:**
- Error handling for invalid input values outside the specified range should be included.
- The function currently assumes that the input values are valid and does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to input validation.
