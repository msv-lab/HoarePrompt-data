`L` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer. The original values of `N` and `X` are not affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state, `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\) and `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\). After executing the code, these conditions still hold.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.**
