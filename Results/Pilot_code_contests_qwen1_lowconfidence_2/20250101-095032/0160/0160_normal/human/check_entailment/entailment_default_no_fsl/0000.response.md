Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not correctly compute the total length of the ray's trajectory for all values of \(N\) and \(X\).

The key issue lies in the way the code handles the reflection process. According to the problem description, the ray will be reflected by the mirrors and by its own trajectory. However, the current implementation only considers reflections off the mirrors and not the self-reflection aspect properly.

The code uses a while loop to iteratively update the values of \(a\) and \(b\) based on their relative sizes, and it adds the appropriate lengths to the result. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the ray can reflect multiple times off itself before finally returning to the starting point. 

To correctly solve this problem, the algorithm needs to account for the fact that the ray's path can be decomposed into segments that form closed loops, and the total length of the trajectory can be computed based on these loops. A more accurate approach would involve calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(N\) and \(X\), and using this to determine the number of segments in each loop.

Given the provided code does not handle this correctly, the program is incorrect.
