You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of Mysterious Light.

Three mirrors of length N are set so that they form an equilateral triangle. Let the vertices of the triangle be a, b and c.

Inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point p on segment ab such that ap = X. (The size of the rifle is negligible.) Now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of Mysterious Light in the direction of bc.

The ray of Mysterious Light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as "ordinary" light. There is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror! When the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed.

The following image shows the ray's trajectory where N = 5 and X = 2.

It can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of N and X. Find the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Constraints

* 2≦N≦10^{12}
* 1≦X≦N-1
* N and X are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N X


Output

Print the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Example

Input

5 2


Output

12
Program:
```
def func():
    L = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    res = n
    a = x
    b = n - x
    flag = True
    while flag:
        if a > b:
            q = a // b
            a -= q * b
            res += 2 * q * b
        elif b > a:
            q = b // a
            b -= q * a
            res += 2 * a * q
        else:
            res += a
            flag = False
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory for the given problem description. The problem requires calculating the trajectory length based on the properties of reflections in an equilateral triangle formed by three mirrors. However, the given implementation does not accurately model these reflections.

For instance, consider the input `N = 7` and `X = 3`. According to the problem, the ray will bounce around inside the triangle and eventually come back to the starting point after a series of reflections. The correct trajectory length can be calculated based on the least common multiple (LCM) of `N` and `X`, but the provided code does not handle this correctly.

Here’s a breakdown of why the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Reflection Handling**: The code attempts to simulate reflections by adjusting the values of `a` and `b` and adding segments accordingly. However, it does not correctly account for the LCM of `N` and `X`, which is essential for determining the total path length.

2. **Incomplete Trajectory Calculation**: The code does not properly handle the infinite loop condition or the calculation of the LCM, leading to incorrect results.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use the formula derived from the properties of reflections in an equilateral triangle, which involves the least common multiple of `N` and `X`.

Since the provided code does not handle the reflections correctly and fails to compute the trajectory length accurately, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( x \) from the standard input where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{12} \) and \( 1 \leq x \leq n-1 \). It then calculates the value of \( res \) by repeatedly applying a series of operations based on the values of \( a \) and \( b \), which are initially set to \( x \) and \( n-x \) respectively. The operations involve updating \( a \) and \( b \) using the floor division and subtraction, and updating \( res \) accordingly. The loop continues until \( a \) equals \( b \). Finally, the function prints the value of \( res \). The function does not return any value. An edge case to consider is when \( n \) is very large (up to \( 10^{12} \)), the function may take a significant amount of time to execute due to the iterative process. Additionally, if \( n \) or \( x \) do not meet the specified constraints, the function assumes default values without any error handling.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
