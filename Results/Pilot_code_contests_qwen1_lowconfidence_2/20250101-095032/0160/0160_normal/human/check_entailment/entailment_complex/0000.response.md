Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( x \) from standard input using `raw_input()`. This matches the problem description, where \( n \) and \( x \) are read from the input.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables \( n \) and \( x \) are initialized correctly based on the input.
   - Variables \( res \), \( a \), and \( b \) are initialized appropriately. \( res \) starts with the value of \( n \), \( a \) starts with \( x \), and \( b \) starts with \( n - x \).

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues as long as `flag` is `True`. 
   - Inside the loop, the program checks whether \( a \) is greater than \( b \) or vice versa.
   - Depending on the comparison, the appropriate values are updated, and the total length of the ray's trajectory (`res`) is incremented accordingly.
   - The loop continues until \( a \) equals \( b \), at which point the `flag` is set to `False`, and the loop exits.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `res` is printed, which represents the total length of the ray's trajectory.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( n \) and \( x \) are within the specified constraints (i.e., \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{12} \) and \( 1 \leq x \leq n-1 \)).
   - The program does not explicitly handle invalid inputs like non-integer inputs or inputs outside the specified range, but the problem description states that the input is assumed to be valid.

6. **Time Complexity**:
   - Although the program iterates until \( a \) equals \( b \), the number of iterations is bounded by the initial values of \( n \) and \( x \), ensuring that the program will terminate in a finite number of steps.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
