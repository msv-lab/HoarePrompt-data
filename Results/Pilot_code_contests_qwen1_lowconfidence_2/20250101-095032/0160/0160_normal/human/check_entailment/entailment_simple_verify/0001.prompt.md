You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of Mysterious Light.

Three mirrors of length N are set so that they form an equilateral triangle. Let the vertices of the triangle be a, b and c.

Inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point p on segment ab such that ap = X. (The size of the rifle is negligible.) Now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of Mysterious Light in the direction of bc.

The ray of Mysterious Light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as "ordinary" light. There is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror! When the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed.

The following image shows the ray's trajectory where N = 5 and X = 2.

It can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of N and X. Find the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Constraints

* 2≦N≦10^{12}
* 1≦X≦N-1
* N and X are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output

Print the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Example

Input

Output

Program:
```
def func():
    L = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    res = n
    a = x
    b = n - x
    flag = True
    while flag:
        if a > b:
            q = a // b
            a -= q * b
            res += 2 * q * b
        elif b > a:
            q = b // a
            b -= q * a
            res += 2 * a * q
        else:
            res += a
            flag = False
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the total length of the ray's trajectory seems flawed. Let's consider a more detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads `N` and `X` from the input and initializes variables `res`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `a` and `b` represent segments of the triangle sides after the initial split.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop continues until `a` equals `b`. Inside the loop, the program checks if `a` is greater than `b` or vice versa, and updates the variables accordingly. However, the logic for updating `res` and the variables `a` and `b` might not cover all possible scenarios, especially when `N` and `X` have complex relationships.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the case where `N = 3` and `X = 1`. According to the problem description, the ray should travel the entire perimeter of the triangle, which is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` units. However, the program would incorrectly calculate this because the loop logic does not properly account for the reflection pattern when `N` and `X` are small.

To illustrate, let's walk through the example `N = 3` and `X = 1`:
- Initial state: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `res = 3`.
- First iteration: `a` is less than `b`, so `q = 2 // 1 = 2`, `a` becomes `1 - 2 * 1 = -1`, `b` becomes `2 - 2 * 1 = 0`, and `res` becomes `3 + 2 * 1 * 2 = 7`.
- Since `a` and `b` are now `0` and `-1`, the loop exits prematurely, and `res` is printed as `7`.

This clearly deviates from the expected result of `9`. Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12} and X is an integer such that 1 ≦ X ≦ N-1.
def func():
    L = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    res = n
    a = x
    b = n - x
    flag = True
    while flag:
        if a > b:
            q = a // b
            a -= q * b
            res += 2 * q * b
        elif b > a:
            q = b // a
            b -= q * a
            res += 2 * a * q
        else:
            res += a
            flag = False
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the first element of the list `L`, `x` is the second element of the list `L`, `res` is the final result obtained by repeatedly applying the loop operations until `a` equals `b`, `a` is `0`, `b` is `0`, and `flag` is `False`.
    print(res)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
