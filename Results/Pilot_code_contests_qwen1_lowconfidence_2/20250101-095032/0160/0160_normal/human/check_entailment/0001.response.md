Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the total length of the ray's trajectory seems flawed. Let's consider a more detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads `N` and `X` from the input and initializes variables `res`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `a` and `b` represent segments of the triangle sides after the initial split.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop continues until `a` equals `b`. Inside the loop, the program checks if `a` is greater than `b` or vice versa, and updates the variables accordingly. However, the logic for updating `res` and the variables `a` and `b` might not cover all possible scenarios, especially when `N` and `X` have complex relationships.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the case where `N = 3` and `X = 1`. According to the problem description, the ray should travel the entire perimeter of the triangle, which is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` units. However, the program would incorrectly calculate this because the loop logic does not properly account for the reflection pattern when `N` and `X` are small.

To illustrate, let's walk through the example `N = 3` and `X = 1`:
- Initial state: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `res = 3`.
- First iteration: `a` is less than `b`, so `q = 2 // 1 = 2`, `a` becomes `1 - 2 * 1 = -1`, `b` becomes `2 - 2 * 1 = 0`, and `res` becomes `3 + 2 * 1 * 2 = 7`.
- Since `a` and `b` are now `0` and `-1`, the loop exits prematurely, and `res` is printed as `7`.

This clearly deviates from the expected result of `9`. Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
