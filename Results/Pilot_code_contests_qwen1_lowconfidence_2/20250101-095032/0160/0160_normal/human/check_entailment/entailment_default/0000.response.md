Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the reflections of the ray of Mysterious Light accurately. The problem requires finding the total length of the ray's trajectory until it returns to the rifle. However, the code appears to be implementing a different logic, likely related to some form of Euclidean algorithm or similar, which does not correctly simulate the reflections in the triangular setup described.

To verify this, let's consider a more detailed analysis:

1. **Problem Description**: The ray starts at point \( p \) on segment \( ab \) and travels towards \( bc \). It reflects off the mirrors and its own trajectory, eventually returning to the rifle at point \( p \).

2. **Expected Trajectory Length**: For any valid \( N \) and \( X \), the ray will follow a specific pattern of reflections, and the total length of the trajectory can be derived based on the properties of the equilateral triangle and the initial position of the ray.

3. **Code Analysis**: The provided code uses a while loop to update the values of \( a \) and \( b \) and accumulates the result in \( res \). However, this approach does not correctly simulate the path of the ray in the triangular setup. The updates to \( a \) and \( b \) do not align with the geometric properties required for the ray's trajectory.

Given these points, the code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
