Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \) followed by \( m \) lines of three space-separated integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \).
   - The constraints on \( n \) and \( m \) are respected (i.e., \( 2 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq m \leq \min(n \cdot (n - 1), 3 \times 10^5) \)).
   - The program ensures that there are no self-loops or multiple edges as specified.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using a list of lists (`weight`), where each sublist `weight[i]` contains all edges with weight `i+1`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A dynamic programming approach is used to compute the longest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the first vertex (vertex 1) to all other vertices.
   - An array `mem` is used to store the longest path lengths for each vertex, initialized to 0.
   - For each possible edge weight from 1 to 100000, the program updates the `mem` array by considering all edges with that weight. Specifically, for each edge `(u, v)` with weight `w`, it updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `mem[u] + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the longest path length from the first vertex to any other vertex in the graph.

Since the program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement and handles the input and output as specified, it is correct according to the problem description.
