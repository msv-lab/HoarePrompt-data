You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pashmak's homework is a problem about graphs. Although he always tries to do his homework completely, he can't solve this problem. As you know, he's really weak at graph theory; so try to help him in solving the problem.

You are given a weighted directed graph with n vertices and m edges. You need to find a path (perhaps, non-simple) with maximum number of edges, such that the weights of the edges increase along the path. In other words, each edge of the path must have strictly greater weight than the previous edge in the path.

Help Pashmak, print the number of edges in the required path.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n ≤ 3·105; 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·105)). Then, m lines follows. The i-th line contains three space separated integers: ui, vi, wi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n; 1 ≤ wi ≤ 105) which indicates that there's a directed edge with weight wi from vertex ui to vertex vi.

It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    (n, m) = rints()
    (mem, edges, weight) = ([0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 + 1)])
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        weight[w].append((u, v))
    for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        all = [(v, mem[u]) for (u, v) in weight[i]]
        for (v, du) in all:
            mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
    print(max(mem))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple paths with the same maximum number of edges but different starting points. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `3` because the maximum trail is `<1, 2, 3>`. However, the current implementation only considers the last seen edge for each weight and does not ensure that it finds the path with the maximum number of edges when multiple paths exist with the same maximum number of edges but different starting points.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we consider all possible paths and keep track of the longest path ending at each vertex for each weight. This requires a more comprehensive approach, possibly using dynamic programming or a similar technique to explore all possible paths.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a directed graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges from standard input, where each edge is defined by a source vertex `u`, a destination vertex `v`, and a weight `w`. It then computes the longest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the first vertex (vertex 1) to all other vertices in the graph, using a dynamic programming approach. The function initializes a `mem` array to store the longest path lengths for each vertex, starting with 0 for all vertices. For each possible edge weight from 1 to 100000, it updates the `mem` array by considering all edges with that weight. Finally, it prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the longest path length from the first vertex to any other vertex in the graph. If there is no path from the first vertex to any other vertex, the output will be 0. This function handles the case where the graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges, as stated in the problem description.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
