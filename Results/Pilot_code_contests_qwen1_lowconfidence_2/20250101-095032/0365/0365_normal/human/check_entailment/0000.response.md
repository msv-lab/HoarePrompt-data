Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no edges with strictly increasing weights. Specifically, the program assumes that there will always be at least one valid path with strictly increasing weights and updates the `mem` array accordingly. However, if the graph does not contain any edges with strictly increasing weights, the program will still output the maximum value found in the `mem` array, which may not represent a valid path.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
```

In this case, there are no edges with strictly increasing weights, but the program will still output `1` because it finds the maximum value in the `mem` array, which is updated based on the presence of the first edge.

To handle this case correctly, the program should check if there is any valid path before outputting the result. Here is a modified version of the program that includes this check:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    (n, m) = rints()
    (mem, edges, weight) = ([0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 + 1)])
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        weight[w].append((u, v))
    
    has_valid_path = False
    for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        all = [(v, mem[u]) for (u, v) in weight[i]]
        for (v, du) in all:
            mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
            if mem[v] > 0:
                has_valid_path = True
    
    if has_valid_path:
        print(max(mem))
    else:
        print(0)

func()
```

This modified version checks if there is any valid path by setting a flag `has_valid_path` and updating it whenever a valid path is found. If no valid path is found, it prints `0`, which is the correct output for this case.
