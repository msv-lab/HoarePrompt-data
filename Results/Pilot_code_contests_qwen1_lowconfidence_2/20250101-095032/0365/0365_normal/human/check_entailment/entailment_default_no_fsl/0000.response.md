Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the code uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the longest path in terms of the number of edges, but it does not correctly handle the condition that each edge in the path must have strictly greater weight than the previous edge in the path.

The code initializes a `mem` array to store the longest path lengths for each vertex, starting with 0 for all vertices. It then iterates over all possible edge weights from 1 to 100000 and updates the `mem` array by considering all edges with that weight. However, this approach does not ensure that the edges in the path have strictly increasing weights.

To fix this, the code needs to maintain a separate value for the maximum weight encountered so far and update the `mem` array only if the current edge weight is strictly greater than the maximum weight encountered so far. Here is an example where the current code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
```

The correct output should be 3, as the longest path with strictly increasing weights is 1 -> 2 -> 3. However, the provided code will output 1 because it does not correctly enforce the strictly increasing weight condition.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem description.
