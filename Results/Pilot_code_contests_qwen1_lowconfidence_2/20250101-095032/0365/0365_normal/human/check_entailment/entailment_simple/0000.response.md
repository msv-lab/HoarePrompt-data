Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input values `n` and `m`, representing the number of vertices and edges respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing three integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`, representing a directed edge from vertex `ui` to vertex `vi` with weight `wi`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   - A list `mem` of length `n + 1` is initialized to store the maximum number of edges for each vertex.
   - A 2D list `edges` is used to store the input data.
   - Another list `weight` of size `10^5 + 1` is initialized to store all edges with the same weight.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - For each edge `(u, v, w)`, the program appends the tuple `(u, v)` to the list `weight[w]`. This step ensures that all edges with the same weight are grouped together.

4. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Path Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over all possible edge weights from 1 to `10^5`.
   - For each weight `w`, it constructs a list `all` containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for all edges `(u, v)` with weight `w`.
   - It then updates the `mem` array such that `mem[v]` is set to the maximum value between its current value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` encountered. This ensures that the longest path with increasing weights is tracked.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the number of edges in the required path.

### Why the Program Meets the Problem Description:

- **Correct Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input as specified, including the number of vertices, edges, and their respective weights.
- **Graph Representation**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to represent the graph in a way that efficiently tracks paths with increasing weights.
- **Path Calculation**: The DP approach ensures that the longest path with strictly increasing edge weights is found, which aligns with the problem requirement.
- **Output Format**: The program outputs the correct number of edges in the required path, as specified in the problem description.

Given that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem description and computes the required output accurately, the program is deemed correct.
