You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pashmak's homework is a problem about graphs. Although he always tries to do his homework completely, he can't solve this problem. As you know, he's really weak at graph theory; so try to help him in solving the problem.

You are given a weighted directed graph with n vertices and m edges. You need to find a path (perhaps, non-simple) with maximum number of edges, such that the weights of the edges increase along the path. In other words, each edge of the path must have strictly greater weight than the previous edge in the path.

Help Pashmak, print the number of edges in the required path.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n ≤ 3·105; 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·105)). Then, m lines follows. The i-th line contains three space separated integers: ui, vi, wi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n; 1 ≤ wi ≤ 105) which indicates that there's a directed edge with weight wi from vertex ui to vertex vi.

It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    (n, m) = rints()
    (mem, edges, weight) = ([0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 + 1)])
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        weight[w].append((u, v))
    for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        all = [(v, mem[u]) for (u, v) in weight[i]]
        for (v, du) in all:
            mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
    print(max(mem))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no edges with strictly increasing weights. Specifically, the program assumes that there will always be at least one valid path with strictly increasing weights and updates the `mem` array accordingly. However, if the graph does not contain any edges with strictly increasing weights, the program will still output the maximum value found in the `mem` array, which may not represent a valid path.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
```

In this case, there are no edges with strictly increasing weights, but the program will still output `1` because it finds the maximum value in the `mem` array, which is updated based on the presence of the first edge.

To handle this case correctly, the program should check if there is any valid path before outputting the result. Here is a modified version of the program that includes this check:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    (n, m) = rints()
    (mem, edges, weight) = ([0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 + 1)])
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        weight[w].append((u, v))
    
    has_valid_path = False
    for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        all = [(v, mem[u]) for (u, v) in weight[i]]
        for (v, du) in all:
            mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
            if mem[v] > 0:
                has_valid_path = True
    
    if has_valid_path:
        print(max(mem))
    else:
        print(0)

func()
```

This modified version checks if there is any valid path by setting a flag `has_valid_path` and updating it whenever a valid path is found. If no valid path is found, it prints `0`, which is the correct output for this case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10^5). Following these, m lines each contain three space-separated integers ui, vi, and wi, where 1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 10^5, representing a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    n, m = rints()
    mem, edges, weight = [0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 +
    1)]
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        weight[w].append((u, v))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\), `m` is equal to the number of edges, `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers, `weight` is a list of 10 sublists where each sublist `weight[i]` contains all tuples `(u, v)` such that the edge `(u, v)` has weight `i+1`.
    for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
        all = [(v, mem[u]) for u, v in weight[i]]
        
        for v, du in all:
            mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[99999]`, `mem[v]` for each vertex `v` is the maximum value between its original value (0) and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` encountered during all iterations of the loop, `i` is 100000.
    print(max(mem))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
