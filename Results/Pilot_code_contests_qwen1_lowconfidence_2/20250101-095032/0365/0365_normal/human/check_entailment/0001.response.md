Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple paths with the same maximum number of edges but different starting points. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `3` because the maximum trail is `<1, 2, 3>`. However, the current implementation only considers the last seen edge for each weight and does not ensure that it finds the path with the maximum number of edges when multiple paths exist with the same maximum number of edges but different starting points.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we consider all possible paths and keep track of the longest path ending at each vertex for each weight. This requires a more comprehensive approach, possibly using dynamic programming or a similar technique to explore all possible paths.
