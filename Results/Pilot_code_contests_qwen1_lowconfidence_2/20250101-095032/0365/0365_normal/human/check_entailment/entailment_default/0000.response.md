Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code attempts to find the longest path in terms of the number of edges where each edge has a strictly greater weight than the previous edge. However, the code does not actually ensure that the weights are increasing along the path. Instead, it simply finds the longest path in terms of the number of edges without considering the weights.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
6 7
1 2 1
3 2 5
2 4 2
2 5 2
2 6 9
5 4 3
4 3 4
```

According to the problem description, the longest path with increasing weights should be from vertex 1 to vertex 2 to vertex 5 to vertex 6, which has 4 edges. However, the provided code would incorrectly find the path from vertex 1 to vertex 2 to vertex 4 to vertex 3 to vertex 4 to vertex 5 to vertex 6, which has 6 edges but does not satisfy the condition of strictly increasing weights.

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
