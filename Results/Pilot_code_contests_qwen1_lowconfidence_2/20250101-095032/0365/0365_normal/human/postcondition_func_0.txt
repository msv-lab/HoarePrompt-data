The function reads a directed graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges from standard input, where each edge is defined by a source vertex `u`, a destination vertex `v`, and a weight `w`. It then computes the longest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the first vertex (vertex 1) to all other vertices in the graph, using a dynamic programming approach. The function initializes a `mem` array to store the longest path lengths for each vertex, starting with 0 for all vertices. For each possible edge weight from 1 to 100000, it updates the `mem` array by considering all edges with that weight. Finally, it prints the maximum value in the `mem` array, which represents the longest path length from the first vertex to any other vertex in the graph. If there is no path from the first vertex to any other vertex, the output will be 0. This function handles the case where the graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges, as stated in the problem description.
