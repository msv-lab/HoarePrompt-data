The input consists of two integers n and m representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. Following these, m lines each contain three integers ui, vi, and wi representing a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi. It is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10^5), and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 10^5. There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the graph.
