The given code snippet `mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)` updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `mem`, `v`, and `du`. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `mem[v]` in terms of these variables.

The output state will include the updated value of `mem[v]`, which is the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. The states of the other variables (`all`, `v`, `du`, `mem`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`all` is a list or iterable containing at least one pair (tuple) of two elements, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`**
