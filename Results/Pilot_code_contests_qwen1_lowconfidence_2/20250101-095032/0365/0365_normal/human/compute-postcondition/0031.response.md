To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop.

### Given Information:
- `all` is a list of pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 1]`.
- `v` and `du` are unchanged.
- `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

### Loop:
```
for (v, du) in all:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `all`:**
   - For the loop to execute, `all` must be a non-empty list. If `all` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.
   
2. **Variables `v` and `du`:**
   - These variables are used within the loop but their initial values do not affect the loop's ability to run. They will be set to the elements of the `all` list during each iteration.
   
3. **Update of `mem[v]`:**
   - The update operation (`mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)`) does not impact the condition for the loop to execute. It happens inside the loop and does not affect the loopâ€™s initialization or continuation.

### Conclusion:
The critical state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the presence of at least one element in the `all` list. If `all` is empty, the loop will never start.

### Final Answer:
State: **`all` is a non-empty list**
