The code snippet `mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)` updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `mem`, `v`, and `du`. Therefore, the only information that can be inferred is that `mem[v]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

Output State: **`all` is a non-empty list, `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`**
