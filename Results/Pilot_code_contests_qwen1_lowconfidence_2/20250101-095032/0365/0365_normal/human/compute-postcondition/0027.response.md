The code updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. This means that for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, the value of `mem[v]` is updated to ensure it holds the maximum value between its current value and `du + 1`.

Since the initial state specifies that for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, `mem[v]` is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1`, the operation in the code ensures that `mem[v]` is already at its maximum value. Therefore, no change will occur to the values of `mem[v]` because they are already updated to be the maximum.

The states of the other variables (`all`, `i`, `v`, `du`) remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. 

Output State: **`all` is a list containing at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 3]`, `i` is `i_previous + 3`, `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` remains unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**
