Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `all` is a non-empty list.
   - `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
   - The value of `du` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `(v, du)` in the list `all`.
   - For each iteration, `v` is the vertex and `du` is the distance update.

3. **State Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over the list `all`, it will continue to the next element in the list if there are still elements left.
   - After processing the current element `(v, du)`, the list `all` should have one fewer element because we are iterating through the list linearly.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - The list `all` will now have one fewer element.
   - The value of `mem[v]` for the current `v` will have been updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
   - The value of `du` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `all` must now be a non-empty list (unless it was empty at the start, but since it's given as non-empty, it will still have at least one element).
   - `mem[v]` for the current `v` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
   - `du` remains unchanged.
   - The next `(v, du)` pair in the list `all` will be used for the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`all` is a non-empty list, `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for the current `v`, and `du` remains unchanged.**
