Let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided information and the loop code:

### Loop Code Analysis:
The loop iterates over each edge in the `edges` list and appends a tuple `(u, v)` to the sublist in `weight` corresponding to the weight `w`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\) inclusive.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and \(\min(n \cdot (n - 1), 3 \times 10^5)\) inclusive.
- `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers.
- `weight` is a list of 10 sublists, initially all empty.

### Key Observations from Provided Output States:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - One of the sublists in `weight` now contains one tuple `(u, v)`.
2. **Second Iteration:**
   - One of the sublists in `weight` now contains two tuples `(u, v)`.
3. **Third Iteration:**
   - One of the sublists in `weight` now contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`.

From these observations, we can infer that each iteration of the loop appends one more tuple `(u, v)` to one of the sublists in `weight`.

### Final Output State:
- **Total Tuples in `weight`:** After all iterations, each sublist in `weight` will contain all the tuples `(u, v)` that correspond to the same weight `w` from the `edges` list.
- **Value of `n` and `m`:** Since the loop runs until all edges are processed, `m` will be fully consumed. Therefore, `m` will be equal to the number of edges, and `n` will be the upper bound on the weights (since `w` ranges from 1 to 10).
- **Value of `mem`:** Remains unchanged as the loop only modifies `weight` and does not affect `mem`.
- **Value of `edges`:** The `edges` list remains unchanged since the loop only processes its contents.
- **Value of `weight`:** Each sublist in `weight` will contain all tuples `(u, v)` corresponding to the weight index of that sublist.

### Output State:
Since the loop processes all edges and appends tuples to the appropriate sublists in `weight`, the final state of the loop after processing all edges is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\), `m` is equal to the number of edges, `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers, `weight` is a list of 10 sublists where each sublist `weight[i]` contains all tuples `(u, v)` such that the edge `(u, v)` has weight `i+1`.**
