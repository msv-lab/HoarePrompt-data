Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute based on the given initial states.

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\) inclusive.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and \(\min(n \cdot (n - 1), 3 \times 10^5)\) inclusive.
- `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers.
- `weight` is a list of 10 (which seems to be a constant and not directly relevant to the loop's execution).

### For Loop:
The for loop iterates over each element `(u, v, w)` in the `edges` list.

### Steps to Determine Necessary Adjustments:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as there are elements in `edges` to iterate over.
2. **Elements in `edges`**: Since `edges` is a 2D list with size `m`, and `m` is defined, the number of elements in `edges` is `m`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the `edges` list has at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` and `m` remain as they are since they determine the bounds but do not directly control the loop's execution.
- `mem` and `weight` are not directly relevant to the loop's condition.
- We need to ensure that the `edges` list has at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\) inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and \(\min(n \cdot (n - 1), 3 \times 10^5)\) inclusive, `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers, `weight` is a list of 10, and the `edges` list must have at least 1 element.**

In a more concise format:
State: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\), `m` is an integer between 1 and \(\min(n \cdot (n - 1), 3 \times 10^5)\), `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers, `weight` is a list of 10, and `edges` must have at least 1 element.**
