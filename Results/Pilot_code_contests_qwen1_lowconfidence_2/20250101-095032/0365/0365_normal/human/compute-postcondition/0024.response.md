Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `all` is a list containing at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.
- `i` is `i_previous + 1`.
- `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`.
- `v` is unchanged.
- `du` is unchanged.
- `mem[v]` is unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

### Analysis of the For Loop:
The for loop iterates over each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `all` contains pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.
   - `i` starts as `i_previous + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.
   - Inside the loop, the value of `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `v` and `du` are unchanged.
   - `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum between its original value and `du + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the loop condition must still be satisfied.
   - Since `all` must contain at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`, and `i` increments by 1, the list `all` should still meet the requirement.
   - The values of `v` and `du` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `mem[v]` remains unchanged from the previous iteration but is now the maximum between its original value and `du + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` increases by 1 from the previous iteration.
   - The values of `v` and `du` remain the same.
   - `mem[v]` remains the same but is now the maximum between its original value and `du + 1`.

### Final State:
- `i` becomes `i_previous + 2` (since it increments by 1 from the previous iteration).
- `v` and `du` remain unchanged.
- `mem[v]` remains the same but is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`all` is a list containing at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 2]`, `i` is `i_previous + 2`, `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**
