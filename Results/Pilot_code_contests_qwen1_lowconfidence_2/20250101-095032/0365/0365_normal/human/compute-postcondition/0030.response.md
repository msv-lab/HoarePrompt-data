The code snippet updates the list `all` by creating a new list comprehension. According to the initial state, `all` originally contains pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i-1]`. Now, the new `all` is defined as `[(v, mem[u]) for u, v in weight[i]]`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The original `all` was constructed from `weight[i_previous + 1 - 1]`, which means `weight[i_previous]`.
2. The new `all` is constructed from `weight[i_previous + 1]`.
3. Each pair `(v, mem[u])` in the new `all` comes directly from the corresponding pair `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 1]`.
4. The values of `v` and `du` remain unchanged, and `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

Since the values of `v` and `du` remain unchanged, and `mem[v]` is updated within the list comprehension but does not affect the `all` list itself (only its contents), the only change is in the structure of `all`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`all` is a list of pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 1]`; `v` and `du` are unchanged; `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**
