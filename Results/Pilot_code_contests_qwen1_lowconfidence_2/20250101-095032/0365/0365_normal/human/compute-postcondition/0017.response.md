According to the code, the loop iterates over pairs in the list `all`. The loop condition for the `for` loop is that there are at least one pair in `all`. At the end of the last iteration, `all` contains at least one pair, `v` is unchanged, and `du` is unchanged. 

The loop updates `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. This means that the loop will continue as long as there are more pairs in `all`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that there are still pairs left in `all`. Since `all` initially contained at least one pair, after removing one pair from it, it must still contain at least one pair for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `all` still contains at least one pair, while `v` and `du` remain unchanged.

State: **`all` is a list or iterable containing at least one pair, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged**
