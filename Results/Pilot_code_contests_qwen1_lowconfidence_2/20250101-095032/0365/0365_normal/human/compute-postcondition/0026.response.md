According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `all`. For the loop to execute again, `all` must contain at least one pair `(v, du)` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i + 2]`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `all` is a list containing at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 2]`.
- `i` is `i_previous + 2`.
- `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`.
- `v` is unchanged.
- `du` is unchanged.
- `mem[v]` is unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `i_previous + 3`. Additionally, `all` must contain at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i + 2]`, which is now `weight[i_previous + 3]`.

State: **`all` is a list containing at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 3]`, `i` is `i_previous + 3`, `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**
