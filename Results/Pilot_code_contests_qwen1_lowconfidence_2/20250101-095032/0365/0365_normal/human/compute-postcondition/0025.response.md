The code snippet updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. Given the precondition, for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. For each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, the value of `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

Since the precondition states that `mem[v]` is already the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, updating `mem[v]` to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` does not change the value of `mem[v]`.

Therefore, the value of `mem[v]` remains unchanged for each `v` in `all`.

The states of the other variables (`all`, `i`, `v`, `du`) are not affected.

Output State: **`all` is a list containing at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous + 2]`, `i` is `i_previous + 2`, `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**
