The line `weight[w].append((u, v))` appends a tuple `(u, v)` to the list `weight[w]`. Here, `w`, `u`, and `v` are variables whose specific values are not given in the initial state. However, we know that `weight` is a list of 10 lists, and `w` must be an index between 0 and 9 because `weight` has 10 elements.

Since the exact values of `w`, `u`, and `v` are not specified, the only thing we can say for sure is that a tuple `(u, v)` is appended to one of the sublists in `weight`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\), `m` is an integer between 1 and \(\min(n \cdot (n - 1), 3 \times 10^5)\), `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers, `weight` is a list of 10, and one of the sublists in `weight` now contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`.**
