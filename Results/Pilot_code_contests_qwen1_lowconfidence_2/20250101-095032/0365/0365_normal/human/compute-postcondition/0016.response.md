The code updates the value of `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`. Since `all` is a list or iterable containing at least one pair, and `v` and `du` are unchanged, the only affected variable is `mem[v]`. The new value of `mem[v]` will be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

Output State: **`all` is a list or iterable containing at least one pair, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`**
