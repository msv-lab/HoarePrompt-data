The code appends a tuple `(u, v)` to the sublist `weight[w]`. Here, `w` is an index into the `weight` list, which is a list of lists containing 10 elements. One of these sublists already contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`, and now another tuple `(u, v)` is being appended to the same sublist.

Given that `w` refers to one of the sublists in `weight` that already contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`, after appending another tuple `(u, v)` to this sublist, the length of this particular sublist will increase by 1.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact sublist `w` or the values of `u` and `v`, we can only say that one of the sublists in `weight` now contains two tuples `(u, v)` instead of just one.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\), `m` is an integer between 0 and \(\min(n \cdot (n - 1), 3 \times 10^5) - 1\), `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m - 1` with random integers, `weight` is a list of 10 sublists, one of which now contains two tuples `(u, v)`.**
