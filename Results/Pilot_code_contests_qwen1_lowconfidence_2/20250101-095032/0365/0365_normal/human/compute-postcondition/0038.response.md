Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\).
- `m` is the number of edges.
- `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers.
- `weight` is a list of 10 sublists where each sublist `weight[i]` contains all tuples `(u, v)` such that the edge `(u, v)` has weight `i+1`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
    all = [(v, mem[u]) for u, v in weight[i]]
    for v, du in all:
        mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### After the Loop Executes Once
- `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[1]`.
- `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.
- `i` becomes 1.

#### After the Loop Executes Twice
- `i` becomes 2.
- `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[2]`.
- `mem[v]` is updated again to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

#### After the Loop Executes Three Times
- `i` becomes 3.
- `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[3]`.
- `mem[v]` is updated again to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

### General Pattern
- For each iteration `i`, `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.
- `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop (i.e., for `i` from 1 to 99999), the final state of the variables can be described as follows:
- `all` will be a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[99999]`.
- `mem[v]` will be updated to the maximum value between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` encountered during all iterations of the loop.
- The value of `i` will be 100000 (since the loop runs from 1 to 100000).

Since the loop iterates from 1 to 100000, it means that every possible edge weight from 1 to 99999 is processed, updating `mem[v]` accordingly.

### Final Output State
**Output State: **`all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[99999]`, `mem[v]` for each vertex `v` is the maximum value between its original value (0) and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` encountered during all iterations of the loop, `i` is 100000.**
