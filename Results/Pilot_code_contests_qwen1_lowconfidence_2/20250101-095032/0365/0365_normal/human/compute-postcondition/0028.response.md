Output State: **`all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_final]`, `i_final` is `i_previous + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `all` contains pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_previous]`. The variable `i` starts as `i_previous + 1`.
- **Loop Execution**: For each iteration of the loop, `i` increments by 1, and the loop processes the pairs in `all` such that `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
- **Final State**: After `k` iterations (where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed), `i` becomes `i_previous + k`. At this point, `all` will contain pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_final]`, where `i_final` is `i_previous + k`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed is described as above.
