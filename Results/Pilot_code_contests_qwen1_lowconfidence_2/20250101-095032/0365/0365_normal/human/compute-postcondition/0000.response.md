The code snippet provided is a lambda function named `rints` that reads a line from standard input, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of integers. This function does not modify any existing variables but rather defines a new function that can be used later to read input.

Given the initial state where the input consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines each containing three integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`, the function `rints` is defined but not called. Therefore, no variables are updated or modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10^5). Following these, m lines each contain three space-separated integers ui, vi, and wi, where 1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 10^5, representing a directed edge from vertex ui to vertex vi with weight wi. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain self-loops or multiple edges; a function `rints` is defined but not called.**
