Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\).
- `m` is equal to the number of edges.
- `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers.
- `weight` is a list of 10 sublists where each sublist `weight[i]` contains all tuples `(u, v)` such that the edge `(u, v)` has weight `i+1`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, 10 ** 5 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates from `1` to `10 ** 5`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[1, 10 ** 5]`.

Given these points, let's identify the necessary adjustments:

- The variable `i` should be set to `1` at the start of the loop since the loop starts from `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `10 ** 5`.
- The variable `i` should not exceed `10 ** 5` for the loop to continue executing.

### Adjusted States:
To ensure the loop can execute correctly, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to `1` and ensure that the loop condition is met. Here are the required adjustments:

- `i` must be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
- `i` must be less than or equal to `10 ** 5` for the loop to continue executing.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than or equal to 10 ** 5**

This ensures that the loop can start and continue executing according to the specified range.
