Output State: **`all` is a non-empty list, `mem[v]` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `du + 1`, and the value of `du` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each pair `(v, du)` in the list `all`.
- For each iteration, `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.
- Since the loop continues as long as `all` is non-empty, after the loop completes, `all` must still be a non-empty list.
- After all iterations, `mem[v]` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all` will be updated to the maximum of its original value and `du + 1`.
- The value of `du` remains unchanged because it is only used within the loop and not modified during the loop iterations.
