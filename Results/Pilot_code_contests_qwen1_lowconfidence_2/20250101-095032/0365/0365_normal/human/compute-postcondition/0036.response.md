The code updates the value of `mem[v]` to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`. This means that `mem[v]` will be set to the higher value between its current value and `du + 1`. The value of `du` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`all` is a non-empty list, `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`, `du` remains unchanged.**
