`n` and `m` are assigned the values of `rints()` which returns two integers. Since `rints_2d` is defined but not called, `rints()` is assumed to return two integers. The values of `n` and `m` are set to these integers. The precondition that the input consists of two integers `n` and `m` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5` and `1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10^5)` is now satisfied and reflected in the new values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3·10^5 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and min(`n`·(`n` - 1), 3·10^5) inclusive**
