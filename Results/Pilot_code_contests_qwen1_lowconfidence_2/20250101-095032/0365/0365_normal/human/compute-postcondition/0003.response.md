The code initializes three variables: `mem`, `edges`, and `weight`. Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. `mem, edges, weight = [0] * (n + 1), rints_2d(m), [[] for _ in range(10 ** 5 + 1)]`
   - `mem` is assigned a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `edges` is assigned the result of `rints_2d(m)`. The function `rints_2d(m)` is assumed to return a 2D list of size `m` filled with random integers. However, since the exact values are not specified, we keep it as `rints_2d(m)`.
   - `weight` is assigned a list of lists, where each sublist is empty. The length of the outer list is `10 ** 5 + 1`.

Given the initial state of `n` and `m`, the output state will be:

- `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers.
- `weight` is a list of `10 ** 5 + 1` sublists, each of which is initially empty.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3·10^5 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and min(`n`·(`n` - 1), 3·10^5) inclusive; `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers; `weight` is a list of `10 ** 5 + 1` sublists, each of which is initially empty.**
