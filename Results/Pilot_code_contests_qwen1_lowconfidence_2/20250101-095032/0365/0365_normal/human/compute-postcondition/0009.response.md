The code snippet appends a tuple `(u, v)` to the sublist `weight[w]`. However, the variables `w`, `u`, and `v` are not defined in the provided initial state, and the values of these variables cannot be determined without additional context. Therefore, the only specific change made by the code is to the `weight` list.

Since the initial state specifies that `weight` is a list of 10 sublists, and one of those sublists now has an additional tuple appended to it, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(3 \times 10^5\), `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `mem` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `edges` is a 2D list of size `m` with random integers, `weight` is a list of 10 sublists, one of which now contains an additional tuple `(u, v)`.**
