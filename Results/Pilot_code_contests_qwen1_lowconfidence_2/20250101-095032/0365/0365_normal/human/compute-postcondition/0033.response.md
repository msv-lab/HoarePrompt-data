Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `(v, du)` in the list `all`.
   - The loop variable `v` represents a vertex or an element in the list.
   - The loop variable `du` represents a distance or some value associated with `v`.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `all` is a non-empty list.
   - `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the list `all` must still contain elements to iterate over.
   - Since `all` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, it means there is at least one element left to process.
   - Therefore, `all` remains a non-empty list.

4. **Update the States:**
   - The value of `v` and `du` will change as the loop iterates through the remaining elements in `all`.
   - `mem[v]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for each element `(v, du)` processed.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `all` is a non-empty list.
- `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for the next element `(v, du)` in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`all` is a non-empty list, `mem[v]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `du + 1` for the next element in the list**
