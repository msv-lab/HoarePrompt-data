Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state after the previous iteration:**
   - `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i_final]`.
   - `i_final` is `i_previous + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed.
   - `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`.
   - `v` is unchanged.
   - `du` is unchanged.
   - `mem[v]` is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `10^5`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration:**
   - The variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_previous + 1`.

4. **Calculate `i_final`:**
   - `i_final` is updated as `i_previous + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed.
   - Since the loop is running from 1 to `10^5`, `k` will be the current value of `i` minus 1.

5. **Update the state:**
   - `i_previous` will become `i` (the new value of `i`).
   - `k` will become `i - 1`.
   - `i_final` will be updated to `i + (i - 1) = 2 * i - 1`.

6. **Adjust the other relevant states:**
   - `all` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and no new pairs are added or modified.
   - `v` and `du` remain unchanged as stated.
   - `mem[v]` values will continue to be updated based on the new `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[2 * i - 1]`, `i` is `i_previous + 1`, `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`**.
