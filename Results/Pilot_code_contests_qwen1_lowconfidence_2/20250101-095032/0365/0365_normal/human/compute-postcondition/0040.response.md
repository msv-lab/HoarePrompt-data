The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on input data that includes two integers `n` and `m`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5` and `1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10^5)`. Following these, `m` lines each contain three space-separated integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`, where `1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n` and `1 ≤ wi ≤ 10^5`, representing a directed edge from vertex `ui` to vertex `vi` with weight `wi`. The graph is guaranteed to not contain self-loops or multiple edges. 

The function processes this input and returns some unspecified result based on the given constraints and edge data. However, without further details on the expected output, we cannot specify the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates on input data including two integers `n` and `m`, and then processes `m` lines of directed edge data to produce some unspecified output.**
