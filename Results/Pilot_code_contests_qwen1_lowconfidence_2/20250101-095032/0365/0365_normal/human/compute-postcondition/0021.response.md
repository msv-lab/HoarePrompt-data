The code creates a new list `all` using a list comprehension. For each pair `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`, it assigns `(v, mem[u])` to `all`. Here are the steps to determine the output state:

1. The initial state includes `all` being a list or iterable containing pairs (tuples) of two elements, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, and `i` is `i_previous + 1`.

2. After executing the code, the new list `all` will contain pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.

3. The value of `i` is updated to `i_previous + 1`.

4. The values of `v`, `du`, and `mem[v]` remain unchanged from their previous state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`; `i` is `i_previous + 1`; `v` is unchanged; `du` is unchanged; `mem[v]` is unchanged, and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

Output State: **`all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`; `i` is `i_previous + 1`; `v` is unchanged; `du` is unchanged; `mem[v]` is unchanged, and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**
