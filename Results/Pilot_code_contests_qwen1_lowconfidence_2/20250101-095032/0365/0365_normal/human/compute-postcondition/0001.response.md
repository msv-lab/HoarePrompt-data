The given code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` tuples, each obtained by calling `rints()`. However, the function `rints()` is not defined, so its exact behavior is unknown. Based on the initial state, the only thing we know for certain is that `rints_2d` will generate a list of `n` tuples, each containing three integers. 

Since `n` and `m` are predefined as the number of vertices and edges respectively, and the function `rints()` is not called, the only changes to the state are related to the definition of the `rints_2d` function.

Output State: **The input consists of two integers `n` and `m`, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1), 3·10^5). Following these, m lines each contain three space-separated integers `ui`, `vi`, and `wi`, where 1 ≤ `ui`, `vi` ≤ n and 1 ≤ `wi` ≤ 10^5, representing a directed edge from vertex `ui` to vertex `vi` with weight `wi`. A function `rints_2d` is defined as `lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]`, but no call to `rints_2d` has been made.**
