Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Given:**
   - `all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`.
   - `i` is `i_previous + 1`.
   - `v` is unchanged.
   - `du` is unchanged.
   - `mem[v]` is unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (v, du) in all:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Requirements:**
   - The loop iterates over each pair `(v, du)` in the list `all`.
   - For the loop to execute, `all` must contain at least one element.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `all` is a list of pairs, we need to ensure that `all` is non-empty. This means there must be at least one pair `(v, du)` in `all`.
   - Additionally, since the loop modifies `mem[v]` to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1`, we need to confirm that `v` and `du` are defined and valid within each pair in `all`.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Ensure `all` contains at least one element.
   - Ensure `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`all` is a list containing at least one pair `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[i]`, `i` is `i_previous + 1`, `v` and `du` are defined and valid for each element in `all`, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is unchanged and it is the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**
