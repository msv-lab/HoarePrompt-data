The code snippet `print(max(mem))` will print the maximum value in the `mem` dictionary. However, the code itself does not change any variable values; it only prints the current maximum value in `mem`. Given the initial state, the values of `all`, `i`, and the structure of `weight` and `mem` remain unchanged.

Since the exact values in `mem` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical output. But we know that the maximum value in `mem` will be printed.

Output State: **`all` is a list containing pairs `(v, mem[u])` for each `(u, v)` in `weight[99999]`, `i` is 100000, and the maximum value in `mem` is printed.**
