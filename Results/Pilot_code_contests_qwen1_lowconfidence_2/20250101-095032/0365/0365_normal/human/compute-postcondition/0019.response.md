Output State: **`all` is a list or iterable containing pairs (tuples) of two elements, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `i` must be less than or equal to 10.
   - `weight` is undefined, causing a NameError.
   - `all` is a list or iterable containing at least one pair `(v, du)`.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for v, du in all:
       mem[v] = max(mem[v], du + 1)
   ```
   This loop iterates over each pair `(v, du)` in `all`. For each iteration:
   - `v` and `du` remain unchanged.
   - `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `du + 1`.

3. **Output State After Some Iterations**:
   - The output state after the loop executes 1 time indicates that `mem[v]` is updated based on the first `(v, du)` pair.
   - The output state after the loop executes 2 times indicates that `mem[v]` is updated based on the first two `(v, du)` pairs.
   - The output state after the loop executes 3 times indicates that `mem[v]` is updated based on the first three `(v, du)` pairs.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over all pairs in `all`, `mem[v]` for each `v` will be updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for every pair `(v, du)` in `all`.
   - The values of `v` and `du` do not change throughout the loop.
   - The state of `all` remains as it was initially, being a list or iterable containing pairs `(v, du)`.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed is that `all` is a list or iterable containing pairs `(v, du)`, `v` and `du` remain unchanged, and `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.
