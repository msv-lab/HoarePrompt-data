According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from 1 to \(10^5\), inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than \(10^5\).

Given that the loop starts from 1 and increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `all` is a list or iterable containing pairs (tuples) of two elements.
- `v` is unchanged.
- `du` is unchanged.
- `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Since the loop iterates up to \(10^5\), the new value of `i` should be the previous value of `i` plus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`all` is a list or iterable containing pairs (tuples) of two elements, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, and `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1.**

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not provided, we can denote it as `i_previous`, and the new value of `i` will be `i_previous + 1`.

State: **`all` is a list or iterable containing pairs (tuples) of two elements, `v` is unchanged, `du` is unchanged, and `mem[v]` is updated to be the maximum between its original value and `du + 1` for each pair `(v, du)` in `all`, and `i` is `i_previous + 1`.**
