The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `x` which is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500). It iterates through a predefined list `potencias` of length 10. If `x` is less than or equal to the value at index 9 in `potencias`, the function does not return anything. If `x` is greater than the value at index 9 but less than or equal to the value at index 8, the function returns the value at index 9. For all other values of `x`, the function returns the value at index 0. This means the function essentially maps the input `x` to one of three possible outputs based on its value relative to the values in the `potencias` list.
