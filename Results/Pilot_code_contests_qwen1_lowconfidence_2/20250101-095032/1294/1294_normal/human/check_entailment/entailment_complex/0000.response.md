Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the function `func_1` determines the value of `k` (the number of participants who will compete in the current round).

#### Problem Description Analysis
- **Objective**: Calculate the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.
- **Logic**:
  - Determine the largest power of 2 (`k`) such that `k <= m` (number of participants in the current round).
  - In each round, `k/2` participants advance to the next round, and `m - k` participants move directly to the next round.
  - Continue until only one participant remains.

#### Code Analysis
- **Function `func_1`**: 
  - The function `func_1` is designed to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
  - However, the implementation of `func_1` uses a hardcoded list `potencias` and iterates over it, which is unnecessary and inefficient.
  - Instead, it should directly calculate the largest power of 2 using logarithms or bit manipulation, which is more appropriate for the given constraints.

- **Main Logic**:
  - The main logic calculates the number of bottles required by iterating through the rounds and updating the number of participants `n` after each round.
  - However, the calculation of `k` in the main loop is incorrect. The variable `k` should be calculated as the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, but the current logic does not achieve this correctly.

#### Example Issue
For `n = 5`:
- According to the problem description, the first round should have `k = 4` (largest power of 2 <= 5), and 2 participants should advance.
- The program incorrectly calculates `k` as 2 (since `k = func_1(n)` and `func_1(5)` should return 4, but it returns 2).

#### Correct Approach
To fix the program, the function `func_1` should be corrected to return the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
import math

def func_1(x):
    return 2 ** int(math.log2(x))

(n, b, p) = map(int, input().split())
bo = 0
to = p * n
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * (n // 2) + (n // 2)  # b bottles for each match + 1 bottle for the judge
    n = n // 2
print(bo, to)
```

This corrected version ensures that the logic follows the problem description accurately.
