You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A tennis tournament with n participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.

The tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):

  * let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k ≤ m, 
  * k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly, 
  * when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. 



Each match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.

Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.

Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).

Input

The only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 ≤ n, b, p ≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.

Output

Print two integers x and y — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.

Examples

Input

5 2 3


Output

20 15


Input

8 2 4


Output

35 32

Note

In the first example will be three rounds:

  1. in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge), 
  2. in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water, 
  3. in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water. 



So in total we need 20 bottles of water.

In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.
Program:
```
(n, b, p) = map(int, raw_input().split())
potencias = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
(bo, to) = (0, p * n)
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * k
    print(n, k, bo)
    n = n - k / 2
    bo += k / 2
    if k == 1:
        break
print(bo, to)

def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if potencias[i] > x:
            return potencias[i - 1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of bottles of water needed for the tournament. Specifically, in the loop where matches are being calculated, the program incorrectly adds `k / 2` to the bottle count (`bo`) after updating `n`. This is because `k / 2` represents the number of matches played in the current round, but adding this directly to the bottle count does not account for the fact that each match requires bottles for both participants and the judge.

For example, consider the input `(5, 2, 3)`. According to the problem description, the calculation should be as follows:

1. First round: 2 matches (each match uses 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 bottles), so `bo = 5`.
2. Second round: 1 match (uses 2 * 1 + 1 = 3 bottles), so `bo = 5 + 3 = 8`.
3. Third round: 1 match (uses 2 * 1 + 1 = 3 bottles), so `bo = 8 + 3 = 11`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates `bo` in the loop, leading to an incorrect result. The correct output for the input `(5, 2, 3)` should be `15` bottles, but the program outputs `20` bottles due to the incorrect addition of `k / 2`.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not handle the bottle count calculation correctly, making it incorrect for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, b, p) = map(int, raw_input().split())
potencias = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
(bo, to) = (0, p * n)
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * k
    print(n, k, bo)
    n = n - k / 2
    bo += k / 2
    if k == 1:
        break
print(bo, to)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), b is an integer representing the number of bottles of water required for each participant per match (1 ≤ b ≤ 500), and p is an integer representing the number of towels given to each participant for the whole tournament (1 ≤ p ≤ 500).
def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if potencias[i] > x:
            return potencias[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), `b` is an integer representing the number of bottles of water required for each participant per match (1 ≤ b ≤ 500), `p` is an integer representing the number of towels given to each participant for the whole tournament (1 ≤ p ≤ 500), `i` is 10, and if `potencias[i]` is greater than `x`, the function returns `potencias[9]`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `x` which is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500). It iterates through a predefined list `potencias` of length 10. If `x` is less than or equal to the value at index 9 in `potencias`, the function does not return anything. If `x` is greater than the value at index 9 but less than or equal to the value at index 8, the function returns the value at index 9. For all other values of `x`, the function returns the value at index 0. This means the function essentially maps the input `x` to one of three possible outputs based on its value relative to the values in the `potencias` list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
