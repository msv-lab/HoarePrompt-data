Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of matches in each round of the tournament. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used appropriately to calculate the number of matches in each round. According to the problem description, `k` should be the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number of participants in the current round. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly find this value. Instead, it maps the number of participants to a fixed set of values from the `potencias` list, which is not consistent with the intended logic.

For example, consider the input `n = 5`. The function `func_1(5)` should return `4` because `4` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `5`. However, `func_1(5)` returns `2`, which is incorrect.

This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of matches and, consequently, the number of bottles of water needed for each round. The code should calculate the number of matches by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the number of participants, but it does not do this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(x):
    k = 1
    while k * 2 <= x:
        k *= 2
    return k
```

With this corrected function, the code would correctly calculate the number of matches and the number of bottles of water needed for the tournament.
