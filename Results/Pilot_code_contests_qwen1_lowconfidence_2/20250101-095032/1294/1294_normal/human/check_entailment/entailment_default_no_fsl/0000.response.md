Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the tournament structure described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used appropriately to determine the number of matches in each round, and the logic for calculating the number of bottles of water is flawed.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Matches per Round**: The function `func_1` attempts to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the number of participants in the current round. However, this function does not correctly determine the number of matches (which should be `k // 2` since each match involves 2 participants). Instead, the function returns a power of 2, which does not directly represent the number of matches.

2. **Incorrect Bottles Calculation**: The code incorrectly adds `k / 2` to `bo` in each iteration of the while loop. This is incorrect because `k / 2` represents the number of participants who advance to the next round, not the number of matches played. Each match requires `b * 2` bottles (for the two participants) plus one bottle for the judge, so the correct calculation should be `bo += 2 * b + 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
(n, b, p) = map(int, input().split())

bo = 0
to = p * n

while n > 1:
    k = max([2**i for i in range(10) if 2**i <= n])
    bo += (n - k) * b + k * b + k
    n = n - k // 2

print(bo, to)
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of matches in each round using the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the current number of participants (`k`) and correctly computes the number of bottles needed for each round.
