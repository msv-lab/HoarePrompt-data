You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A tennis tournament with n participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.

The tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):

  * let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k ≤ m, 
  * k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly, 
  * when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. 



Each match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.

Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.

Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).

Input

The only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 ≤ n, b, p ≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.

Output

Print two integers x and y — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.

Examples

Input

5 2 3


Output

20 15


Input

8 2 4


Output

35 32

Note

In the first example will be three rounds:

  1. in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge), 
  2. in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water, 
  3. in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water. 



So in total we need 20 bottles of water.

In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.
Program:
```
(n, b, p) = map(int, raw_input().split())
potencias = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
(bo, to) = (0, p * n)
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * k
    print(n, k, bo)
    n = n - k / 2
    bo += k / 2
    if k == 1:
        break
print(bo, to)

def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if potencias[i] > x:
            return potencias[i - 1]


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `x` which is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500). It iterates through a predefined list `potencias` of length 10. If `x` is less than or equal to the value at index 9 in `potencias`, the function does not return anything. If `x` is greater than the value at index 9 but less than or equal to the value at index 8, the function returns the value at index 9. For all other values of `x`, the function returns the value at index 0. This means the function essentially maps the input `x` to one of three possible outputs based on its value relative to the values in the `potencias` list.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
