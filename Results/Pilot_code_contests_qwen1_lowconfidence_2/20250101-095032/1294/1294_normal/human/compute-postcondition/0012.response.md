Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `x` which is an integer representing the number of participants (1 ≤ x ≤ 500). It iterates through a predefined list `potencias` of length 10. If `x` is less than or equal to the value at index 9 in `potencias`, the function does not return anything. If `x` is greater than the value at index 9 but less than or equal to the value at index 8, the function returns the value at index 9. For all other values of `x`, the function returns the value at index 0. This means the function essentially maps the input `x` to one of three possible outputs based on its value relative to the values in the `potencias` list.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is exactly 0 or negative, the behavior is undefined because the function expects `x` to be within the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 500. However, since the input is not validated, the function might still attempt to access elements in the `potencias` list which could lead to an out-of-bounds error.
- If `x` is greater than the last element in `potencias` (which is `potencias[9]`), the function will return `potencias[0]` instead of `potencias[9]` as implied by the annotations and the return postconditions. This discrepancy should be corrected in the annotations.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function should validate the input `x` to ensure it falls within the specified range (1 ≤ x ≤ 500) before proceeding with the iteration. Without this validation, the function may behave unpredictably if an invalid value is passed.
