The function `func_4()` accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers representing the strictly increasing heights `ai` of the holds (each height being a positive integer not exceeding 1000). After execution, the function will ensure that the list of heights is sorted in ascending order. If the input list is already sorted, no changes will be made. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the input list in place.
