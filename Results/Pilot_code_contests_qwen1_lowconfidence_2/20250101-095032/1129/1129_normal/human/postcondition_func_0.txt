The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, which contains `n` space-separated integers `ai` (where \(3 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq ai \leq 1000\)), and the sequence of these integers is strictly increasing. It converts this string into a list of integers and returns this list. The function ensures that the returned list maintains the strictly increasing order of the integers. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.
