Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the scenario where the hold to be removed is either the second or the second-to-last hold in the sequence. Let's analyze the issue:

- **Function `func_3`:** This function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements (`max_1`) and the minimum difference between elements that are two positions apart (`min_2`). It then returns the maximum of these two values.
- **Edge Cases:** Consider the following inputs:
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the function correctly returns `1`.
  - For the input `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, the function correctly returns `2`.
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 7, 8]`, the function returns `4`, which is incorrect because removing the second element (`2`) would result in the sequence `[1, 3, 7, 8]` with a difficulty of `4`, but removing the third element (`3`) would result in the sequence `[1, 2, 7, 8]` with a difficulty of `5`.

To fix this, the code needs to consider the impact of removing the second and second-to-last elements specifically. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_1 = -float('inf')
    min_2 = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate max difference between consecutive elements
    for k in range(len(a_s) - 1):
        max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
    
    # Calculate min difference between elements that are two positions apart
    for k in range(len(a_s) - 2):
        min_2 = min(min_2, a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k])
    
    # Check the impact of removing the second and second-to-last elements
    if len(a_s) > 2:
        diff_remove_second = a_s[2] - a_s[0]
        diff_remove_second_to_last = a_s[-1] - a_s[-3]
        min_2 = min(min_2, diff_remove_second, diff_remove_second_to_last)
    
    return max(max_1, min_2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the code handles the edge cases correctly and returns the minimum difficulty after removing one hold.
