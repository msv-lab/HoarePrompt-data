You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mike is trying rock climbing but he is awful at it. 

There are n holds on the wall, i-th hold is at height ai off the ground. Besides, let the sequence ai increase, that is, ai < ai + 1 for all i from 1 to n - 1; we will call such sequence a track. Mike thinks that the track a1, ..., an has difficulty <image>. In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.

Today Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights a1, ..., an. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions.

Help Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of holds.

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), where ai is the height where the hold number i hangs. The sequence ai is increasing (i.e. each element except for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).

Output

Print a single number — the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.

Examples

Input

3
1 4 6


Output

5


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5


Output

2


Input

5
1 2 3 7 8


Output

4

Note

In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1, 6), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.

In the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.

In the third test you can obtain sequences (1, 3, 7, 8), (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element we obtain the optimal answer — 4.
Program:
```
import fileinput
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]

#Function 2:
def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s

#Function 3:
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_1 = -float('inf')
    min_2 = float('inf')
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
        max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 2):
        min_2 = min(min_2, a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k])
    return max(max_1, min_2)

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    assert func_1('1 2 3') == [1, 2, 3]
    assert func_3(['3', '1 4 6']) == 5
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 4 5']) == 2
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 7 8']) == 4


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the hold to be removed is either the second or the second-to-last hold in the sequence. Let's analyze the given examples and identify the issue:

1. **Example 1**: Input `3 1 4 6`
   - Removing the second hold results in `1, 6` with a difficulty of `5`.
   - This is correct.

2. **Example 2**: Input `5 1 2 3 4 5`
   - Removing any hold results in a difficulty of `2`.
   - This is correct.

3. **Example 3**: Input `5 1 2 3 7 8`
   - The output is `4`, but this is incorrect. If we remove the second hold, we get `1, 3, 7, 8` with a difficulty of `4`. However, if we remove the fourth hold, we get `1, 2, 3, 8` with a difficulty of `5`. The correct minimum difficulty should be `4`.

The current implementation of `func_3` calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the minimum difference between the second-to-last and first elements. However, it does not account for the scenario where the removed hold is the second or second-to-last element. To fix this, we need to consider these specific cases separately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_3(args):
    a_s = [int(x) for x in args[1].split()]
    max_diff = a_s[1] - a_s[0]
    min_diff = a_s[-1] - a_s[-2]
    
    # Check removing the second element
    if len(a_s) > 2:
        diff = a_s[2] - a_s[0]
        max_diff = max(max_diff, diff)
    
    # Check removing the second-to-last element
    if len(a_s) > 3:
        diff = a_s[-1] - a_s[-3]
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    
    # Calculate the new max difficulty after removing each hold
    for k in range(1, len(a_s) - 1):
        diff = a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k - 1]
        max_diff = max(max_diff, diff)
    
    return max_diff

# Testing the function with the provided examples
assert func_3(['3', '1 4 6']) == 5
assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 4 5']) == 2
assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 7 8']) == 4
```

This corrected function ensures that all possible cases of removing a hold are considered, including the second and second-to-last elements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4()` accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers representing the strictly increasing heights `ai` of the holds (each height being a positive integer not exceeding 1000). After execution, the function will ensure that the list of heights is sorted in ascending order. If the input list is already sorted, no changes will be made. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the input list in place.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
