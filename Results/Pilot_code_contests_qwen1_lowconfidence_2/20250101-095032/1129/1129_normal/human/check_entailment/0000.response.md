Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum difficulty after removing one hold. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not handle the removal of the first or last hold properly, as required by the problem description. Additionally, the logic for finding the minimum difficulty after removing one hold is flawed.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
3
1 4 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this case because it does not account for the removal of the first or last hold. The function `func_3` only considers the differences between adjacent elements in the array and does not properly simulate the removal of the first or last hold.

A corrected version of the function should explicitly handle the removal of the first and last hold and then calculate the maximum difference between adjacent elements in the modified array. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_diff = -float('inf')
    
    # Remove the first hold and calculate max diff
    temp_a_s = a_s[1:]
    for k in range(len(temp_a_s) - 1):
        max_diff = max(max_diff, temp_a_s[k + 1] - temp_a_s[k])
    
    # Remove the last hold and calculate max diff
    temp_a_s = a_s[:-1]
    for k in range(len(temp_a_s) - 1):
        max_diff = max(max_diff, temp_a_s[k + 1] - temp_a_s[k])
    
    # Return the minimum of the two scenarios
    return max_diff
```

This corrected function ensures that both the first and last holds are considered for removal and calculates the minimum difficulty accordingly.
