Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The annotated version confirms that the current implementation of `func_3` does not correctly handle the scenarios where the removed hold is either the second or the second-to-last element in the sequence. Specifically, the annotations indicate that the program calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the minimum difference between the second-to-last and first elements, but it does not account for the specific cases where the removed element is the second or second-to-last element. This oversight leads to incorrect results in certain cases, as demonstrated in the third example provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements and needs the additional logic to handle these edge cases as described in the correction section.
