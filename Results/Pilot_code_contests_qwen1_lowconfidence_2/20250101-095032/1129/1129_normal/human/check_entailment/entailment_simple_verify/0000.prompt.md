You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mike is trying rock climbing but he is awful at it. 

There are n holds on the wall, i-th hold is at height ai off the ground. Besides, let the sequence ai increase, that is, ai < ai + 1 for all i from 1 to n - 1; we will call such sequence a track. Mike thinks that the track a1, ..., an has difficulty <image>. In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.

Today Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights a1, ..., an. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions.

Help Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of holds.

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), where ai is the height where the hold number i hangs. The sequence ai is increasing (i.e. each element except for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).

Output

Print a single number — the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.

Examples

Input

3
1 4 6


Output

5


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5


Output

2


Input

5
1 2 3 7 8


Output

4

Note

In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1, 6), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.

In the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.

In the third test you can obtain sequences (1, 3, 7, 8), (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element we obtain the optimal answer — 4.
Program:
```
import fileinput
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]

#Function 2:
def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s

#Function 3:
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_1 = -float('inf')
    min_2 = float('inf')
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
        max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 2):
        min_2 = min(min_2, a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k])
    return max(max_1, min_2)

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    assert func_1('1 2 3') == [1, 2, 3]
    assert func_3(['3', '1 4 6']) == 5
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 4 5']) == 2
    assert func_3(['5', '1 2 3 7 8']) == 4


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum difficulty after removing one hold. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not handle the removal of the first or last hold properly, as required by the problem description. Additionally, the logic for finding the minimum difficulty after removing one hold is flawed.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
3
1 4 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this case because it does not account for the removal of the first or last hold. The function `func_3` only considers the differences between adjacent elements in the array and does not properly simulate the removal of the first or last hold.

A corrected version of the function should explicitly handle the removal of the first and last hold and then calculate the maximum difference between adjacent elements in the modified array. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3(args, verbose=False):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_diff = -float('inf')
    
    # Remove the first hold and calculate max diff
    temp_a_s = a_s[1:]
    for k in range(len(temp_a_s) - 1):
        max_diff = max(max_diff, temp_a_s[k + 1] - temp_a_s[k])
    
    # Remove the last hold and calculate max diff
    temp_a_s = a_s[:-1]
    for k in range(len(temp_a_s) - 1):
        max_diff = max(max_diff, temp_a_s[k + 1] - temp_a_s[k])
    
    # Return the minimum of the two scenarios
    return max_diff
```

This corrected function ensures that both the first and last holds are considered for removal and calculates the minimum difficulty accordingly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements.
    #- `max_1` is `-float('inf')`.
    #- `min_2` is `float('inf')`.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```
    #for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
    #    max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    ##### After the First Iteration
    #- `k` starts at 0.
    #- `max_1` is updated to `max(-float('inf'), a_s[1] - a_s[0])`, so `max_1` becomes `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`.
    #
    ##### After the Second Iteration
    #- `k` increments to 1.
    #- `max_1` is updated to `max(a_s[1] - a_s[0], a_s[3] - a_s[2])`, assuming `len(a_s) >= 3`. If `len(a_s) < 3`, the loop would stop after the first iteration.
    #
    ##### After the Third Iteration
    #- `k` increments to 2.
    #- `max_1` is updated to `max(a_s[1] - a_s[0], a_s[3] - a_s[2], a_s[4] - a_s[3])`, assuming `len(a_s) >= 4`.
    #
    ##### General Pattern
    #- The loop iterates from `k = 0` to `k = len(a_s) - 2`.
    #- `max_1` is updated in each iteration to be the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished (if `len(a_s) >= 2`), `max_1` will be the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
    #
    #- `a_s` remains a list with at least 2 elements.
    #- `max_1` is the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
    #- `min_2` remains `float('inf')` because it is not updated in the loop.
    #- `k` will be `len(a_s) - 2` after the last iteration.
