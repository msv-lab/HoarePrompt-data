Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_3` does not correctly calculate the minimum difficulty after removing one hold. Specifically:

1. The function `func_3` does not handle the removal of the first or last hold properly, as required by the problem description. It only calculates the maximum difference between adjacent elements in the original sequence without considering the removal of the first or last hold explicitly.
2. The function `func_3` uses a loop to find the maximum difference between adjacent elements (`max_1`) and another loop to find the minimum difference between non-adjacent elements (`min_2`). However, this approach does not correctly simulate the removal of the first or last hold, which is a crucial part of the problem.
3. The annotated version confirms that the function does not properly account for the removal of the first or last hold. It only iterates through the list to find the maximum and minimum differences between elements, without considering the impact of removing specific elements.

Given these observations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and thus the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
