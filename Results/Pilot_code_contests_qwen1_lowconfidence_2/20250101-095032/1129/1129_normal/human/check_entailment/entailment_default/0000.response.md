Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold. Specifically, `func_3` computes the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the minimum difference between elements that are two positions apart, but it does not consider the scenario where removing a specific hold can reduce the maximum difference between adjacent holds.

To illustrate, let's consider the following example:

- Input: `['5', '1 2 3 7 8']`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Actual Output: `4`

This example seems to work correctly. However, consider another example:

- Input: `['5', '1 2 3 4 5']`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `2`

While this example works, it does not fully cover all cases. Let's consider a more complex case:

- Input: `['5', '1 2 3 4 6']`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `4`

In this case, the function `func_3` does not correctly handle the scenario where removing the hold at index 3 (height 4) results in the minimum difficulty. The function should consider removing each hold and calculating the resulting difficulty, but it currently does not do so.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
