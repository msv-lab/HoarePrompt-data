You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mike is trying rock climbing but he is awful at it. 

There are n holds on the wall, i-th hold is at height ai off the ground. Besides, let the sequence ai increase, that is, ai < ai + 1 for all i from 1 to n - 1; we will call such sequence a track. Mike thinks that the track a1, ..., an has difficulty <image>. In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.

Today Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights a1, ..., an. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions.

Help Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of holds.

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), where ai is the height where the hold number i hangs. The sequence ai is increasing (i.e. each element except for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).

Output

Print a single number — the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.

Examples

Output

4

Note

In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1, 6), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.

In the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.

In the third test you can obtain sequences (1, 3, 7, 8), (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element we obtain the optimal answer — 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import fileinput

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from sys import argv
    if argv.pop() == 'test':
        func_4()
    else:
        func_3(list(fileinput.input()), verbose=True)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing n space-separated integers ai (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), representing the heights of the holds, and the sequence ai is strictly increasing.
def func_1(s):
    return [int(x) for x in s.split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the string `s`, where `s` contains n space-separated integers ai (with 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), and the sequence ai is strictly increasing

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a list containing at least one element, and the second element of args (args[1]) is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds on the wall, where the list is sorted in strictly increasing order.
def func_2(args):
    a_s = tuple(func_1(args[1]))
    return a_s
    #`a_s` is a tuple containing the elements of the list `args[1]`, which is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds on the wall, sorted in strictly increasing order

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `a_s` is a list of `int` representing the heights of the holds, where the length of `a_s` is `len(a_s) == n` and `a_s` is strictly increasing.
def func_3(args, verbose):
    a_s = func_2(args)
    max_1 = -float('inf')
    min_2 = float('inf')
    for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
        max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements.
    #- `max_1` is `-float('inf')`.
    #- `min_2` is `float('inf')`.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```
    #for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
    #    max_1 = max(max_1, a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k])
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    ##### After the First Iteration
    #- `k` starts at 0.
    #- `max_1` is updated to `max(-float('inf'), a_s[1] - a_s[0])`, so `max_1` becomes `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`.
    #
    ##### After the Second Iteration
    #- `k` increments to 1.
    #- `max_1` is updated to `max(a_s[1] - a_s[0], a_s[3] - a_s[2])`, assuming `len(a_s) >= 3`. If `len(a_s) < 3`, the loop would stop after the first iteration.
    #
    ##### After the Third Iteration
    #- `k` increments to 2.
    #- `max_1` is updated to `max(a_s[1] - a_s[0], a_s[3] - a_s[2], a_s[4] - a_s[3])`, assuming `len(a_s) >= 4`.
    #
    ##### General Pattern
    #- The loop iterates from `k = 0` to `k = len(a_s) - 2`.
    #- `max_1` is updated in each iteration to be the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `a_s`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished (if `len(a_s) >= 2`), `max_1` will be the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
    #
    #- `a_s` remains a list with at least 2 elements.
    #- `max_1` is the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
    #- `min_2` remains `float('inf')` because it is not updated in the loop.
    #- `k` will be `len(a_s) - 2` after the last iteration.
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State: `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`, `min_2` is `float('inf')`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 2`.**

    #
    ##### After the Second Iteration
    #- `k` increments to 1.
    #- `min_2` is updated to `min(a_s[2] - a_s[0], a_s[4] - a_s[1])`, assuming `len(a_s) >= 4`.
    #
    ##### General Pattern
    #- The loop iterates from `k = 0` to `k = len(a_s) - 3`.
    #- `min_2` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum difference `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]`.

    return max(max_1, min_2)
    #`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is `-float('inf')`, `min_2` is the minimum value among all differences `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]` for `k` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 3`, and the program returns the maximum value between `max_1` and `min_2`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers representing the heights ai of the holds where each height is a positive integer not exceeding 1000, and the sequence is strictly increasing.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
