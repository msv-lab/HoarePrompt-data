Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when the list of hold heights has fewer than 3 elements, which violates the problem description requirement that \(3 \leq n \leq 100\). Specifically, if the input list has fewer than 3 elements, the function `func_3` will still attempt to compute `max_1` and `min_2`, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2]`:
- According to the problem description, the input list should have at least 3 elements.
- However, the code will still process this list, resulting in `max_1` being `-float('inf')` and `min_2` being `float('inf')`, which will lead to an incorrect output of `0`.

Thus, the code is incorrect because it fails to handle invalid inputs according to the problem description.
