The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `args` and a boolean `verbose`. It processes the list `args` to compute two values: `max_1`, which is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list, and `min_2`, which is the minimum difference between elements that are two positions apart in the list. After computing these values, the function returns the maximum of `max_1` and `min_2`. If the list `args` contains fewer than 3 elements, the function will still execute the loops but will result in `max_1` being `-float('inf')` and `min_2` being `float('inf')` if the list has fewer than 2 elements, respectively. The function does not modify the original list `args`; instead, it uses local variables `max_1` and `min_2` to store the computed values.
