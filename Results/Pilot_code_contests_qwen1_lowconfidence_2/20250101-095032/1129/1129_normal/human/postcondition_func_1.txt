The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `args`, which is expected to be a list with at least two elements, where the second element (`args[1]`) is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds on a climbing wall, sorted in strictly increasing order. The function then converts this list into a tuple and returns it. The function ensures that the input list `args[1]` remains unchanged and only works on its copy. There are no missing functionalities in the given code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `args[1]` retains its original state, while the function returns a new tuple containing the same elements as `args[1]`, also sorted in strictly increasing order.
