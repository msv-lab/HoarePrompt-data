Functionality: **The function `func_4()` accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers representing the strictly increasing heights `ai` of the holds (each height being a positive integer not exceeding 1000). After execution, the function will ensure that the list of heights is sorted in ascending order. If the input list is already sorted, no changes will be made. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the input list in place.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input list is already sorted, the function will leave it unchanged.
- If `n` is outside the range [3, 100], the function will not modify the list and will effectively do nothing.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the function modifies the input list in place, but the provided code does not include any sorting logic. Therefore, the function does not perform any sorting operation, and the input list remains unchanged.
