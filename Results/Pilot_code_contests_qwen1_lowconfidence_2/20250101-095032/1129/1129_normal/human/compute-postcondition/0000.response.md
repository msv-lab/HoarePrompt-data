The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers representing the heights `ai` of the holds, where each height is a positive integer not exceeding 1000, and the sequence is strictly increasing. The function does not return any specific value based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of `n` strictly increasing positive integers not exceeding 1000.
