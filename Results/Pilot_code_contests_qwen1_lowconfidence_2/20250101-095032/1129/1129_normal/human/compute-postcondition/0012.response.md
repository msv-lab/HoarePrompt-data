Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `max_1` is the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
- `min_2` is `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 3]`.
- `k` is `len(a_s) - 3`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `k < len(a_s) - 2`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `k` is currently `len(a_s) - 3` (based on the initial state).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `k` should become `len(a_s) - 2`.

4. **Adjusting Other Variables**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no changes are expected to `a_s`, `max_1`, or `min_2` in this specific context. However, we need to ensure these variables remain consistent with their definitions.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- `a_s` remains a list with at least 2 elements.
- `max_1` remains the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
- `min_2` remains `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 3]`.
- `k` is now `len(a_s) - 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`, `min_2` is `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 3]`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 2`**
