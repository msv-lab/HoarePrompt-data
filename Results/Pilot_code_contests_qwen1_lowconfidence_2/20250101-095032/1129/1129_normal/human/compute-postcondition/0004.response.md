The code updates the value of `max_1` to be the maximum between its current value (`-float('inf')`) and the difference between the `(k+1)`-th element and the `k`-th element of the list `a_s`. Since `k` is 0 initially, the code calculates `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`.

Given that `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, let's denote the first element as `a_s[0]` and the second element as `a_s[1]`. Therefore, `max_1` is updated to the maximum of `-float('inf')` and `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`. Since `-float('inf')` is less than any real number, `max_1` will take the value of `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`.

The other variables `min_2`, `a_s`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`, `min_2` is float('inf'), `k` is 0**
