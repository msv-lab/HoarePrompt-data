Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements.
   - `max_1` is the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`.
   - `min_2` is `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 3]`.
   - `k` is `len(a_s) - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over the range defined by `xrange(len(a_s) - 2)`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `k` is currently equal to `len(a_s) - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `len(a_s) - 2`.
   - Therefore, `k` needs to be set to `len(a_s) - 3`.

5. **Other States:**
   - `a_s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `max_1` and `min_2` remain unchanged as they are not dependent on `k` in this context.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `k` is now `len(a_s) - 3`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is the maximum value among all differences `a_s[i + 1] - a_s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`, `min_2` is `a_s[len(a_s) - 1] - a_s[len(a_s) - 3]`, `k` is `len(a_s) - 3`**
