To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `a_s` is reassigned to the output of `func_2(args)`.
- `max_1` is `-float('inf')`.
- `min_2` is `float('inf')`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for k in xrange(len(a_s) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `k`:**
   - The loop variable `k` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 until `k < len(a_s) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(a_s) - 1` must be at least 1 (since `xrange` is inclusive on the lower bound and exclusive on the upper bound).

2. **List `a_s`:**
   - To satisfy the condition `len(a_s) - 1 >= 1`, `a_s` must have at least 2 elements (i.e., `len(a_s) >= 2`).

3. **Variables `max_1` and `min_2`:**
   - These variables are not directly related to the loop condition but may be used within the loop body. They don't need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to start.

### Required Adjustments:
- `a_s` must have at least 2 elements.
- `k` will start from 0.

### Final State:
State: **`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is -float('inf'), `min_2` is float('inf'), `k` is 0**
