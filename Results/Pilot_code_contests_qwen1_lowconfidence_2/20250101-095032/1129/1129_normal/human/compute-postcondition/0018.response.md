The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `args` and `verbose`. 

- `args` is expected to be a list of integers (`int`) representing the heights of holds, where the length of the list is at least 2 and the list is strictly increasing.
- `verbose` is a boolean indicating whether detailed information should be printed during the execution of the function.

After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum value between `max_1` and `min_2`, where `max_1` is initially set to `-float('inf')` and `min_2` is the minimum value among all differences `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]` for `k` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3`, with `k` being equal to `len(a_s) - 3`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list `args` (representing hold heights) and a boolean `verbose`, and return the maximum value between an initial value of `-float('inf')` and the minimum difference found among specific indexed elements in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `args` (a list of integers) and a parameter `verbose` (a boolean), and returns the maximum value between `-float('inf')` and the minimum difference among `a_s[k + 2] - a_s[k]` for `k` ranging from `0` to `len(a_s) - 3`.**
