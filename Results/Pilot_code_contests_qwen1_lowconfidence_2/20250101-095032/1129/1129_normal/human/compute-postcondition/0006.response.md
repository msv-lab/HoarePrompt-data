The code updates the value of `max_1` to be the maximum between its current value and `a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k]`. Given that `k` is 2, this translates to updating `max_1` to be the maximum between its current value and `a_s[3] - a_s[2]`. The initial state tells us that `max_1` is `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`. After executing the code, `max_1` will be updated to be the maximum of `a_s[1] - a_s[0]` and `a_s[3] - a_s[2]`.

Output State: **`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is the maximum of `a_s[1] - a_s[0]` and `a_s[3] - a_s[2]`, `min_2` is `float('inf')`, `k` is 2**
