Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements.
   - `max_1` is the maximum of `a_s[1] - a_s[0]` and `a_s[3] - a_s[2]`.
   - `min_2` is `float('inf')`.
   - `k` is 2.

2. **For Loop Analysis**:
   - The for loop iterates over `k` from 0 to `len(a_s) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `len(a_s) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `k` would be 3.
   - Therefore, `k` needs to be 3 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - The length of the list `a_s` does not change, so it remains as a list with at least 2 elements.
   - The values of `max_1` and `min_2` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and we don't have information about how these variables might be updated within the loop.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is the maximum of `a_s[1] - a_s[0]` and `a_s[3] - a_s[2]`, `min_2` is `float('inf')`, `k` is 3**
