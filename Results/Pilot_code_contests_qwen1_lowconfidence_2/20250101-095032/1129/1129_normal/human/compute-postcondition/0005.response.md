According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`. The loop variable `k` is used as the index to access elements of the list `a_s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `max_1` is set to `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`.
- `min_2` is initialized to `float('inf')`.
- `k` is the current index, which means it was incremented at the end of the previous iteration.

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to:
1. Check if the loop condition allows for another iteration.
2. Update the values of `max_1`, `min_2`, and `k` based on the current loop behavior.

Since the loop runs from `0` to `len(a_s) - 2`, the loop can continue as long as `k < len(a_s) - 2`. After the previous iteration, `k` was incremented, so `k` would now be `1` (assuming `k` started at `0`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `len(a_s) - 2`. Therefore, `k` should be updated to `2`.

Next, we need to update `max_1` and `min_2`:
- `max_1` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it, but since no such information is given, we assume it stays the same.
- `min_2` is updated in the loop body, but without details of the loop body, we assume it remains as `float('inf')` unless updated.

Given this reasoning:

State: **`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`, `min_2` is `float('inf')`, `k` is 2**
