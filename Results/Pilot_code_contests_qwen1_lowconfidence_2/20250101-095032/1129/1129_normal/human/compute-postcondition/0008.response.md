The code snippet updates the value of `max_1` to be the maximum of its current value and `a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k]`. Given that `k` is currently 3, the expression `a_s[k + 1] - a_s[k]` becomes `a_s[4] - a_s[3]`.

Let's analyze the changes:
- The value of `max_1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_1`) and `a_s[4] - a_s[3]`.
- The values of `a_s`, `min_2`, and `k` remain unchanged from their previous state.

Since `max_1` is the maximum of `a_s[1] - a_s[0]` and `a_s[3] - a_s[2]`, and now it is updated to include `a_s[4] - a_s[3]`, the new value of `max_1` is the maximum of these three differences.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a_s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `max_1` is the maximum of `a_s[1] - a_s[0]`, `a_s[3] - a_s[2]`, and `a_s[4] - a_s[3]`, `min_2` is `float('inf')`, `k` is 4**
