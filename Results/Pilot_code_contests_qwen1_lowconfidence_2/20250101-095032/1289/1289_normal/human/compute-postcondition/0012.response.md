The code updates `maxx` to be the maximum of its current value (`maxx`) and `a`. Given the initial state, let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The initial state of `maxx` is either `-10^18` if `a_new <= -10^18`, otherwise it is `a_new` if `a_new > -10^18`.
2. The new value of `maxx` will be the maximum of the current `maxx` and `a`.

Therefore, if `a >= maxx`, then `maxx` remains unchanged (since the maximum of `maxx` and `a` would be `a`, but since `a` is already at least as large as `maxx`, `maxx` stays the same). If `a < maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `maxx`.

Given these points, the updated state of `maxx` depends on the relationship between `a` and the initial value of `maxx`.

Output State: **`maxx` is `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and `a > -10^18` otherwise, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a`; `maxy` is the maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b_new`; `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the minimum of `b_new` and its previous value, which is less than or equal to `10^18`; `z` is 1; `t` must be greater than 0.**
