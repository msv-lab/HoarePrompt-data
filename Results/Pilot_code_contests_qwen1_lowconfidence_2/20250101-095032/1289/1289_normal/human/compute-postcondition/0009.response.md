`miny` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `b`. Since `b` is an integer read from input, we need to consider two cases: when `b` is less than or equal to `miny` and when `b` is greater than `miny`.

- If `b` is less than or equal to `miny`, `miny` remains unchanged because it is already the minimum.
- If `b` is greater than `miny`, `miny` is updated to `b`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`maxx` is \(-10^{18}\) if `a` is less than or equal to \(-10^{18}\), otherwise `maxx` is `a`; `maxy` is the maximum of `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the minimum of `b` and its previous value (which was \(\leq 10^{18}\)); `z` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input.**
