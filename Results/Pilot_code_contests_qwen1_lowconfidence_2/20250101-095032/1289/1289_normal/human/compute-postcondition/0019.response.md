The code updates `minx` to be the minimum of its current value and `a`. Since `minx` is defined as the smaller of `a` and its previous value, the new value of `minx` will remain unchanged because `min(minx, a)` is already `minx`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum of its original value and `a`; `maxy` is the larger of the previous `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the smaller of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the smaller of `b` and its previous value; `z` is 2; `t` must be greater than 0.**
