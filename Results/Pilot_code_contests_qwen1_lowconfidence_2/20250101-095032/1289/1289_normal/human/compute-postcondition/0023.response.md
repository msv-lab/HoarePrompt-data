The code calculates the maximum of `maxx - minx` and `maxy - miny`, squares the result, and prints it. However, the values of `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` are not altered by this code. The values of `z` and `t` are also not affected.

The output of the print statement will be the square of the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of `a` or `b`.

Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum value of all `a` read from input, `maxy` is the maximum value of all `b` read from input, `minx` is the minimum value of all `a` read from input, `miny` is the minimum value of all `b` read from input, `z` is `t-1`, `t` must be greater than 0, and the output is the square of the maximum of (maxx - minx) and (maxy - miny).**
