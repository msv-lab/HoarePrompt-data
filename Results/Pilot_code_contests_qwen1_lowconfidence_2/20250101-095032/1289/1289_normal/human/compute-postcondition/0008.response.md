The code updates `maxy` to be the maximum value between `maxy` and `b`. Since `maxy` is initially \(-10^{18}\) or a value greater than \(-10^{18}\), and `b` is an integer read from input, `maxy` will be updated to `b` if `b` is greater than `maxy`. If `b` is less than or equal to `maxy`, `maxy` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, `z`, `t`, `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`maxx` is \(-10^{18}\) if `a` is less than or equal to \(-10^{18}\), otherwise `maxx` is `a`; `maxy` is the maximum of `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\); `z` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input.**
