The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the mines. This list has at least 2 elements and at most 1000 elements, and each coordinate (xi, yi) satisfies -10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9. 

Case_1: The function returns the total number of unique x-coordinates from the given list of mine coordinates.
Case_2: The function returns the total number of unique y-coordinates from the given list of mine coordinates.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the mines, and return either the total number of unique x-coordinates or the total number of unique y-coordinates from the given list, depending on which case is satisfied.
