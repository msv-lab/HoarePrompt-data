The code snippet updates the value of `maxy` to be the maximum of its current value and `b`. According to the initial state, `maxy` is the larger of its previous value and `b`. Since the code does not change the relationship between `maxy` and `b`, the value of `maxy` remains the same as it was initially.

The other variables (`maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, `z`, and `t`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum of its original value and `a`; `maxy` is the larger of the previous `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the smaller of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the smaller of `b` and its previous value; `z` is 2; `t` must be greater than 0; `maxy` is unchanged.**
