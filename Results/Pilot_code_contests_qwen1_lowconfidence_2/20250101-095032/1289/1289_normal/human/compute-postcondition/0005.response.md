The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial values of `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, `miny`, `z`, and the condition on `t` remain unchanged.

- `maxx` is \(-10^{18}\)
- `maxy` is \(-10^{18}\)
- `minx` is \(10^{18}\)
- `miny` is \(10^{18}\)
- `z` is 0
- `t` must be greater than 0

After executing the code, the values of `maxx` and `maxy` could potentially change if `a` and `b` are greater than their respective current maximum values. Similarly, the values of `minx` and `miny` could potentially change if `a` and `b` are less than their respective current minimum values. However, without knowing the actual values of `a` and `b`, we cannot specify the exact new values for `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, and `miny`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`maxx` is \(-10^{18}\) or a value greater than \(-10^{18}\); `maxy` is \(-10^{18}\) or a value greater than \(-10^{18}\); `minx` is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\); `miny` is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\); `z` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input.**
