The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Let's break this down:

1. `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers read from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`.
2. `maxx` is initially set to `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and `-10^18` otherwise.
3. `maxy` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `b`.
4. `minx` is updated to be the minimum of `a` and its previous value.
5. `miny` is updated to be the minimum of `b` and its previous value.
6. `z` remains 2.
7. `t` must remain greater than 0.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we'll denote them as `a` and `b` in the output state.

- `maxx` will be `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and the larger of `-10^18` and `a` otherwise.
- `maxy` will be the larger of its previous value and `b`.
- `minx` will be the smaller of `a` and its previous value.
- `miny` will be the smaller of `b` and its previous value.
- `z` remains 2.
- `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`maxx` is `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and the larger of `-10^18` and `a` otherwise; `maxy` is the larger of the previous `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the smaller of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the smaller of `b` and its previous value; `z` is 2; `t` must be greater than 0.**
