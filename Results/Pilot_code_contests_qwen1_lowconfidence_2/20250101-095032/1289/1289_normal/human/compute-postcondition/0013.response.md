The code `minx = min(minx, a)` updates the value of `minx` to be the minimum of its current value and `a`. Based on the initial state, if `a <= -10^18`, then `maxx = -10^18`, otherwise, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a`. The value of `maxx` remains unchanged since the code does not affect `maxx`. `maxy` and `miny` are not affected by this line of code. The value of `z` and `t` also remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `a <= -10^18`, then `maxx = -10^18`.
- Otherwise, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a`.
- `maxy` is the maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b_new`.
- `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value.
- `miny` is the minimum of `b_new` and its previous value, which is less than or equal to `10^18`.
- `z` is 1.
- `t` must be greater than 0.

After executing the code, the only change is to the value of `minx`. Therefore, `minx` is now the minimum of its previous value and `a`.

Output State: **`maxx` is `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and `-10^18` otherwise; `maxy` is the maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b_new`; `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the minimum of `b_new` and its previous value, which is less than or equal to `10^18`; `z` is 1; `t` must be greater than 0.**
