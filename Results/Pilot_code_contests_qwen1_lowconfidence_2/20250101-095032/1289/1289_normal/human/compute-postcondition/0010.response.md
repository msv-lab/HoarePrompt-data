Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop statement step by step.

### Initial Program State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `maxx`: The maximum value between \(-10^{18}\) (if \(a\) is less than or equal to \(-10^{18}\)) and \(a\).
- `maxy`: The maximum value between `maxy` and \(b\).
- `minx`: The minimum value between \(a\) and its previous value.
- `miny`: The minimum value between \(b\) and its previous value (which was \(\leq 10^{18}\)).
- `z`: 0 (this is the initial value of `z` before the loop starts, it increments by 1 each iteration).
- `t`: Must be greater than 0.
- `a`: An integer read from input.
- `b`: An integer read from input.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for z in xrange(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `z`:**
   - Initially, `z` is 0.
   - After each iteration, `z` increases by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be less than `t`.

2. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop.

3. **Other Variables (`maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, `miny`, `a`, `b`):**
   - These variables are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `z`.
   - Their values remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `z` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- Since `z` was initially 0, after one iteration, `z` becomes 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `z` must be less than `t`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`maxx` is \(-10^{18}\) if `a` is less than or equal to \(-10^{18}\), otherwise `maxx` is `a`; `maxy` is the maximum of `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the minimum of `b` and its previous value (which was \(\leq 10^{18}\)); `z` is 1; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input.**
