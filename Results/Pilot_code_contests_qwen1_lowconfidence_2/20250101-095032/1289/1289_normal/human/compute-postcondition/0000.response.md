The code `t = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state includes a list of pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the mines, and this code does not affect that list or any other variables related to those coordinates, the only change is that the variable `t` is assigned the integer value from the input.

Output State: **The input is a list of pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the mines, `t` is an integer value from the input.**
