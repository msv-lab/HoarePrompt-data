`minx` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (which is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\)) and the input value `a`. If `a` is smaller than the current value of `minx`, then `minx` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `minx` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`maxx` is \(-10^{18}\) if `a` is less than or equal to \(-10^{18}\), otherwise `maxx` is `a`; `maxy` is \(-10^{18}\) or a value greater than \(-10^{18}\); `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value (which is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\)); `miny` is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\); `z` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input.**
