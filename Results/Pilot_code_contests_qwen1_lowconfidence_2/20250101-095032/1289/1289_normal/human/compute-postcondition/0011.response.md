The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Let's analyze the impact on the variables step-by-step:

1. `maxx` is updated based on the new value of `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `-10^18`, `maxx` remains `-10^18`; otherwise, `maxx` becomes `a`.
2. `maxy` is updated based on the new value of `b`. Since `maxy` is initially the maximum of `maxy` and `b`, and `b` is one of the inputs, `maxy` becomes the maximum of the current `maxy` and `b`.
3. `minx` is updated to be the minimum of `a` and its previous value. If `a` is less than the previous value of `minx`, `minx` becomes `a`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
4. `miny` is updated to be the minimum of `b` and its previous value, which is less than or equal to `10^18`. If `b` is less than the previous value of `miny`, `miny` becomes `b`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
5. `z` is explicitly stated to be 1 and does not change.
6. `t` must be greater than 0 and is not affected by this code.

Let's denote the new values of `a` and `b` as `a_new` and `b_new` respectively. Based on the conditions provided in the initial state, we can write the updated values as follows:

- `maxx` will be `-10^18` if `a_new <= -10^18`, otherwise `maxx` will be `a_new` if `a_new > -10^18` and also considering the previous value of `maxx`.
- `maxy` will be the maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b_new`.
- `minx` will be the minimum of `a_new` and its previous value.
- `miny` will be the minimum of `b_new` and its previous value, which is less than or equal to `10^18`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`maxx` is `-10^18` if `a_new <= -10^18`, otherwise `maxx` is `a_new` if `a_new > -10^18` and also considering the previous value of `maxx`; `maxy` is the maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b_new`; `minx` is the minimum of `a_new` and its previous value; `miny` is the minimum of `b_new` and its previous value, which is less than or equal to `10^18`; `z` is 1; `t` must be greater than 0.**
