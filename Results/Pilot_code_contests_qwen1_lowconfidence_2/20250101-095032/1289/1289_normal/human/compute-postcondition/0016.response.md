Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `maxx`: `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and `-10^18` otherwise.
   - `maxy`: The maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b`.
   - `minx`: The minimum of `a` and its previous value.
   - `miny`: The minimum of `b` and its previous value.
   - `z`: 1.
   - `t`: Must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `z` in `xrange(t)`. This means the loop will execute `t` times.

3. **Current Iteration End State:**
   - `z` is currently 1, meaning it has already completed the first iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `z` should be 2 (i.e., `z = z + 1`).

4. **Determine Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `z` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, the condition for the next iteration is that `z < t`.
   - Given `z` is currently 1 and `t` must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be less than `t`.

5. **Adjust States:**
   - `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, and `miny` remain unchanged as they depend on the values of `a` and `b` which are not modified within the loop context provided.
   - `z` should be set to 2.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`maxx` is `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and `-10^18` otherwise; `maxy` is the maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the minimum of `b` and its previous value; `z` is 2; `t` must be greater than 0.**
