The code `maxx = max(maxx, a)` updates the value of `maxx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `a`. Since `a` is an integer read from input in the previous step, we know `a` is an integer. We also know the initial value of `maxx` is \(-10^{18}\).

If `a` is greater than \(-10^{18}\), then `maxx` will be updated to `a`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains \(-10^{18}\).

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`maxx` is \(-10^{18}\) if `a` is less than or equal to \(-10^{18}\), otherwise `maxx` is `a`; `maxy` is \(-10^{18}\) or a value greater than \(-10^{18}\); `minx` is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\); `miny` is \(10^{18}\) or a value smaller than \(10^{18}\); `z` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input.**
