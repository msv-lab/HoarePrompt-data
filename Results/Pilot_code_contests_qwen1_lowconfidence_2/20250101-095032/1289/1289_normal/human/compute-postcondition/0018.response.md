The code snippet updates the value of `maxx` to be the maximum of its current value (`maxx`) and the value of `a`. Let's consider the different cases for the initial values of `maxx` and `a`:

1. If `a <= -10^18`, then `maxx` is `-10^18`.
   - If `a > -10^18`, then `maxx` remains `-10^18`.
   - If `a <= -10^18`, then `maxx` is updated to `a`, which is also `-10^18`.

2. If `a > -10^18`, then `maxx` is the larger of `-10^18` and `a`, so `maxx` is `a`.

In both cases, after the execution of `maxx = max(maxx, a)`, the value of `maxx` will be the maximum of its original value and `a`. Since `maxy`, `minx`, `miny`, `z`, and `t` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `a`.
- `maxy` remains the same.
- `minx` remains the same.
- `miny` remains the same.
- `z` remains 2.
- `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is the maximum of its original value and `a`; `maxy` is the larger of the previous `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the smaller of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the smaller of `b` and its previous value; `z` is 2; `t` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum of its original value and `a`; `maxy` is the larger of the previous `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the smaller of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the smaller of `b` and its previous value; `z` is 2; `t` must be greater than 0.**
