`miny` is assigned the value of \(10^{18}\). The values of `maxx`, `maxy`, and `minx` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is \(-10^{18}\), `maxy` is \(-10^{18}\); `minx` is \(10^{18}\); `miny` is \(10^{18}\).

Output State: **`maxx` is \(-10^{18}\), `maxy` is \(-10^{18}\); `minx` is \(10^{18}\); `miny` is \(10^{18}\)**.
