`maxy` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`maxy`) and `b`. The value of `b` is not specified, but it must be less than or equal to \(10^{18}\) because `miny` is the minimum of `b_new` (which is equal to `b`) and its previous value, which is less than or equal to \(10^{18}\).

- If `b` is greater than or equal to `maxy`, then `maxy` remains unchanged.
- If `b` is less than `maxy`, then `maxy` is updated to `b`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxx` is `-10^18` if `a <= -10^18` and `-10^18` otherwise; `maxy` is the maximum of the previous `maxy` and `b`; `minx` is the minimum of `a` and its previous value; `miny` is the minimum of `b_new` and its previous value, which is less than or equal to `10^18`; `z` is 1; `t` must be greater than 0.**
