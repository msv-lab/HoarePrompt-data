Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func` attempts to find the bounding box for the mines by calculating the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates separately. However, it fails to account for the fact that the city must be a square, meaning the width and height of the bounding box must be equal. The code simply takes the larger difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates and squares it, which results in a rectangle, not necessarily a square.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should calculate the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. The side length of the square city should be the maximum of these two differences. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Use input() instead of raw_input() for Python 3 compatibility
    maxx, maxy, minx, miny = float('-inf'), float('-inf'), float('inf'), float('inf')
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, x)
        minx = min(minx, x)
        maxy = max(maxy, y)
        miny = min(miny, y)
    side_length = max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)
    print(side_length ** 2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the city is built as a square with the minimum area that covers all the mines.
