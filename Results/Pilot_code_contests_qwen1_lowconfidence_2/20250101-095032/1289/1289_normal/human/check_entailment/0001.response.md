Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not calculate the minimum possible area of the city correctly. The logic in the program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and prints the square of the maximum of these differences. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting rectangle will cover all mines. It only ensures that the rectangle has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and passes through the extreme points.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0
2 2
2 0
```

In this case, the program would output `4` because the maximum difference in x-coordinates (`2`) and y-coordinates (`2`) is `2`, and `2^2 = 4`. However, the minimum possible area of the city that can cover all the mines is actually `4`, but the correct approach should be to find the bounding box that includes all points, which in this case would still be a square of side length `2`.

The correct approach should be to find the width and height of the bounding box, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, respectively. The minimum area of the city is then the product of these two values, ensuring that the bounding box covers all mines.
