        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\), `z` is a non-negative integer such that \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\), `delit` is the largest integer \(k\) such that \(\frac{z}{4} - k \geq 1\) and \(\frac{y}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\) and \(\frac{x}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\), or 0 if no such \(k\) exists.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\), `z` is a non-negative integer such that \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\), `delit` is the largest integer \(k\) such that \(\frac{z}{4} - k \geq 1\) and \(\frac{y}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\) and \(\frac{x}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\), or 0 if no such \(k\) exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, all of which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 1000\). The function aims to find the largest integer `delit` such that \(\frac{z}{4} - k \geq 1\) and \(\frac{y}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\) and \(\frac{x}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\), where `k` is an integer starting from `z / 4` and decrementing until it satisfies the conditions or reaches 0. If no such `delit` exists, the function returns 0.
