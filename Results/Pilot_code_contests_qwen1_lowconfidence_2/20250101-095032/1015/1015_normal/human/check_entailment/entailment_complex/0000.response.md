Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from the input, representing the number of lemons (`limon`), apples (`yabl`), and pears (`grush`). The input handling is straightforward and ensures that the inputs are integers within the specified range.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` (representing lemons, apples, and pears respectively).
   - It checks if the inputs satisfy the necessary conditions (`z < 4 or y < 2 or x < 1`) and returns 0 if they do not. This condition ensures that if there are not enough fruits to maintain the ratio 1:2:4, the function returns 0.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it initializes `delit` with the value `z // 4` and iteratively decreases `delit` until it finds the largest value such that:
     - There are at least `delit` lemons.
     - There are at least `2 * delit` apples.
     - There are at least `4 * delit` pears.
   - The function returns the largest valid `delit`, ensuring that the fruits are used in the required ratio.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - After determining `delit`, the program calculates the total number of fruits used, which is `delit * 7` (since each set uses 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).
   - It prints this total, which is the maximum number of fruits that can be used while maintaining the required ratio.

The program correctly handles all cases described in the problem statement:
- When there are sufficient fruits to maintain the ratio, it calculates and prints the maximum number of fruits.
- When there are insufficient fruits, it prints 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
