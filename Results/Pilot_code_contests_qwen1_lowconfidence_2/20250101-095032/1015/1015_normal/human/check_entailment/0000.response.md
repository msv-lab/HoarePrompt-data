Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of lemons, apples, or pears is insufficient to meet the required ratio of 1:2:4. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be used based on the number of pears alone. This leads to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2
```
According to the problem description, Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, but he only has 2 pears. The correct output should be 3 (1 lemon + 2 apples + 0 pears), but the program outputs 0 because it does not correctly handle this edge case.
