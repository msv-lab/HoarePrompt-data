Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` indeed incorrectly handles the case where the number of lemons, apples, or pears is insufficient to meet the required ratio of 1:2:4. The function only checks the condition `z < 4` and uses `z / 4` directly without considering the actual counts of lemons and apples. This leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the number of lemons and apples are not sufficient even though the number of pears might be more than 4.

For example, in the input:
```
1
3
2
```
The function `func_1` will incorrectly return 0 because it does not properly account for the insufficient number of lemons and apples. The correct output should be 3 (1 lemon + 2 apples + 0 pears), but the program outputs 0 due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected to properly handle all edge cases.
