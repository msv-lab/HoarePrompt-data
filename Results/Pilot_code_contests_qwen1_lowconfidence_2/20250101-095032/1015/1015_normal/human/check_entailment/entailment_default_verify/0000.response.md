Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the program. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the number of apples or lemons is insufficient to meet the required ratio of 1:2:4. Specifically, the function only checks the number of pears (`z`) and does not properly validate the number of lemons (`x`) and apples (`y`). This leads to incorrect results in cases where the number of lemons or apples is less than the required amount for the given number of pears.

For example, in the input:
```
1
3
2
```
The program should output `3` (1 lemon + 2 apples + 0 pears), but it outputs `0` because it does not correctly handle the insufficient number of lemons or apples.

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints, leading to the final assessment of **False**.
