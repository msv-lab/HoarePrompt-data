You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 

Input

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.

Output

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.

Examples

Input

7


Output

7


Input

4
7
13


Output

21


Input

2

2


Output

0

Note

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0. 
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    limon = int(raw_input())
    yabl = int(raw_input())
    grush = int(raw_input())
    delit = func_1(limon, yabl, grush)
    print(str(delit * 7))

def func_1(x, y, z):
    if z < 4 or y < 2 or x < 1:
        return 0
    else:
        delit = z / 4
        while delit >= 1:
            if y / delit >= 1 and x / delit >= 1:
                return delit
            else:
                delit = delit - 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the number of apples and pears is not sufficient to form the required ratio of 1:2:4 with the lemons. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the number of pears (`z`) is less than 4, but it does not properly check if the number of apples (`y`) is at least twice the number of lemons (`x`). Additionally, the logic to decrement `delit` in the while loop might lead to incorrect results if the initial value of `delit` is too large.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3
8
```

According to the problem description, Nikolay should be able to use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears, resulting in a total of 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 fruits. However, the current implementation will return 0 because the initial check `y < 2` fails.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the number of apples is at least twice the number of lemons and the number of pears is at least four times the number of lemons before determining the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be used.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, all of which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 1000\). The function aims to find the largest integer `delit` such that \(\frac{z}{4} - k \geq 1\) and \(\frac{y}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\) and \(\frac{x}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\), where `k` is an integer starting from `z / 4` and decrementing until it satisfies the conditions or reaches 0. If no such `delit` exists, the function returns 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
