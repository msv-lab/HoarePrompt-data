Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly determining the maximum number of compote sets that can be made from the given fruits. The logic inside the `while` loop is flawed and does not guarantee finding the correct `delit`.

Here is an example that shows the issue:

For the input:
```
2
5
7
```

The expected output is `7`, but the provided code outputs `0`. This happens because the `while` loop starts with `delit = z / 4`, which in this case is `1` (since `7 // 4 = 1`). The loop then decrements `delit` until it finds a value that satisfies the conditions, but it never actually checks if `y / delit >= 2` and `x / delit >= 1` before returning `delit`.

A correct implementation would be to start with `delit` set to `min(x // 1, y // 2, z // 4)` and ensure that the conditions are met correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    limon = int(input())
    yabl = int(input())
    grush = int(input())
    delit = min(limon, yabl // 2, grush // 4)
    print(str(delit * 7))
```

This version directly calculates the maximum number of sets that can be made and prints the result correctly.
