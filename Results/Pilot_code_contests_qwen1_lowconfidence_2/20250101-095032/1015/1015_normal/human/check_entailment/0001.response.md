Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the number of apples and pears is not sufficient to form the required ratio of 1:2:4 with the lemons. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the number of pears (`z`) is less than 4, but it does not properly check if the number of apples (`y`) is at least twice the number of lemons (`x`). Additionally, the logic to decrement `delit` in the while loop might lead to incorrect results if the initial value of `delit` is too large.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3
8
```

According to the problem description, Nikolay should be able to use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears, resulting in a total of 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 fruits. However, the current implementation will return 0 because the initial check `y < 2` fails.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the number of apples is at least twice the number of lemons and the number of pears is at least four times the number of lemons before determining the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be used.
