Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to find the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be used according to the ratio 1:2:4, but it does not correctly handle the conditions for the number of apples and lemons. Specifically:

- The function `func_1` starts by checking if `z < 4` or `y < 2` or `x < 1`, which are correct conditions to ensure there are enough pears, apples, and lemons respectively. However, it then uses a decrementing loop to find the maximum number of sets, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
- The logic inside the loop is flawed because it subtracts 1 from `delit` without ensuring that the resulting values for apples and lemons still meet the required ratio. For example, if `z = 8` (4 sets of pears), `y = 10` (5 sets of apples), and `x = 2` (1 set of lemons), the current implementation would incorrectly return 0 because the loop would decrement `delit` until it fails the condition, even though 1 set is possible.

A correct implementation should directly calculate the minimum number of sets that can be formed based on the available fruits:

```python
def func_1(x, y, z):
    if z < 4 or y < 2 or x < 1:
        return 0
    else:
        sets = min(z // 4, min(y // 2, x))
        return sets * 7
```

This implementation ensures that the number of sets is limited by the smallest possible value that satisfies the 1:2:4 ratio, thus correctly calculating the maximum total number of fruits that can be used.
