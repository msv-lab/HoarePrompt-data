Let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop:

- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\).
- `z` is a non-negative integer such that \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\).
- `delit` is equal to \(z / 4\).

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while delit >= 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `delit >= 1` must be true. Given that `delit = z / 4`, we need to ensure that \( \frac{z}{4} \geq 1 \).

Since \(z\) is in the range \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\), the minimum value of \(z\) is 4. When \(z = 4\):
\[ \frac{z}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

This satisfies the condition \( \frac{z}{4} \geq 1 \). For any value of \(z\) greater than 4, the condition will still hold true.

Thus, no adjustments are necessary for the other variables (`x` and `y`) as they do not affect the loop condition directly. The only relevant state to consider is `z` being within its valid range to ensure `delit` is at least 1.

So, the required state modification is:
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= y <= 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= z <= 1000, `delit` is equal to `z / 4` and `delit` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Final answer:
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= y <= 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= z <= 1000, `delit` is equal to `z / 4` and `delit` must be greater than or equal to 1**
