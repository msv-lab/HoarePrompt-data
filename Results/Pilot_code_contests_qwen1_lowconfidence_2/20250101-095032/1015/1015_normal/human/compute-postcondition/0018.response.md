The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. All parameters are non-negative integers such that 1 <= x, y, z <= 1000.

- In Case_1, the function returns `0`.
- In Case_2, the function returns `delit`, which is equal to `z / 4` and is greater than or equal to 1.
- In Case_3, the function returns `delit`, which is equal to `z / 4 - 1` and is at least 1.
- In Case_4, the function returns either `(z / 4) - 1` or `(z / 4) - 2`, given that `z` is at least 8 and both `y` and `x` divided by this value must be at least 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, and based on specific conditions, return either `0`, `z / 4`, `z / 4 - 1`, `(z / 4) - 1`, or `(z / 4) - 2`.
