The code `delit = z / 4` assigns the value of `z / 4` to the variable `delit`. Since `z` is a non-negative integer and is greater than or equal to 4, `delit` will be a float representing the division of `z` by 4. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= y <= 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= z <= 1000, `delit` is equal to `z / 4`**
