Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= y <= 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= z <= 1000, `delit` is equal to `z / 4` and `delit` is greater than or equal to 1, the current value of `y / delit` is greater than or equal to 1 and the current value of `x / delit` is greater than or equal to 1**
