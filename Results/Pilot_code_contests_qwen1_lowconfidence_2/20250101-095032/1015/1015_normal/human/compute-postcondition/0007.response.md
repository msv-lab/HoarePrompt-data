Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= y <= 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= z <= 1000, `delit` is equal to `z / 4` and `delit` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either `y / delit < 1` or `x / delit < 1`**
