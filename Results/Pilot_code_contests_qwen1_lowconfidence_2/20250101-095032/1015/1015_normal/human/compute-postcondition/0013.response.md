To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the `while` loop continues: `delit >= 1`.

Given:
- `delit` is either \(\frac{z}{4} - 1\) (if \(y / delit \geq 1\) and \(x / delit \geq 1\)) or \(\frac{z}{4} - 2\).

For the loop to continue, `delit` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the range for \(z\)**:
   - Given \(z \geq 8\).

2. **Calculate the possible values for \(\frac{z}{4}\)**:
   - Since \(z \geq 8\), \(\frac{z}{4} \geq 2\).

3. **Evaluate \(\frac{z}{4} - 1\) and \(\frac{z}{4} - 2\)**:
   - \(\frac{z}{4} - 1 \geq 1\)
   - \(\frac{z}{4} - 2 \geq 0\) (but this value would not affect the condition as long as \(\frac{z}{4} - 1 \geq 1\))

4. **Condition for the loop**:
   - The loop will continue if \(delit \geq 1\).

5. **Check the conditions for \(\frac{z}{4} - 1\)**:
   - For \(\frac{z}{4} - 1 \geq 1\), this simplifies to \(\frac{z}{4} \geq 2\), which is always true since \(z \geq 8\).

6. **Check the conditions for \(\frac{z}{4} - 2\)**:
   - For \(\frac{z}{4} - 2 \geq 1\), this simplifies to \(\frac{z}{4} \geq 3\), or \(z \geq 12\).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - If \(z \geq 12\), then \(\frac{z}{4} - 2 \geq 1\), and the loop will continue regardless of the values of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - If \(z < 12\), then \(\frac{z}{4} - 2\) will not satisfy the condition, but \(\frac{z}{4} - 1\) will always be at least 1 (since \(\frac{z}{4} \geq 2\)), ensuring the loop continues.

Since \(z\) must be at least 8, and for \(z \geq 12\), the loop will always continue, the only constraint that matters for the loop to continue is that \(z \geq 8\).

Therefore, no additional constraints need to be imposed on `x` or `y` for the loop to continue.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\), `z` must be at least 8, and `delit` is either equal to \(\frac{z}{4} - 1\) (if \(y / delit \geq 1\) and \(x / delit \geq 1\)) or equal to \(\frac{z}{4} - 2\)**.
