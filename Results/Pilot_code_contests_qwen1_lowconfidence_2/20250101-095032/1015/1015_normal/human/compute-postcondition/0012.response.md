Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\), `z` must be at least 8, and `delit` is either equal to \(\frac{z}{4} - 1\) (if \(y / delit \geq 1\) and \(x / delit \geq 1\)) or equal to \(\frac{z}{4} - 2\).**
