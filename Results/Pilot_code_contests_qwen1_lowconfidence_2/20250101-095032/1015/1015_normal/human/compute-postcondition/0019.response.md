Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, all of which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 1000\). The function aims to find the largest integer `delit` such that \(\frac{z}{4} - k \geq 1\) and \(\frac{y}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\) and \(\frac{x}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\), where `k` is an integer starting from `z / 4` and decrementing until it satisfies the conditions or reaches 0. If no such `delit` exists, the function returns 0.**

- **Case 1:** If the initial conditions \(z < 4\), \(y < 2\), or \(x < 1\) are met, the function immediately returns 0.
- **Case 2:** If \(z \geq 4\), \(y \geq 2\), and \(x \geq 1\), the function starts with `delit` set to \(\frac{z}{4}\). It then decrements `delit` while checking if \(\frac{y}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\) and \(\frac{x}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\). The function returns the first `delit` that satisfies these conditions.
- **Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
  - The code correctly handles the case when `z` is less than 4 by returning 0 immediately.
  - However, the code does not explicitly handle the case when `y` is exactly 2 and `x` is exactly 1, even though it should theoretically work as long as the other conditions are met.
  - The function correctly decrements `delit` until it finds the largest possible value that satisfies the conditions or reaches 0, ensuring that the returned value is the largest possible valid `delit`.

In summary, the function `func_1` evaluates the largest integer `delit` that can be derived from `z`, `y`, and `x` under the specified conditions, and returns it if it exists; otherwise, it returns 0.
