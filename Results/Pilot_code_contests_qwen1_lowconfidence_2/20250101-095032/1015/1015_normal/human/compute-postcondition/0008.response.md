`delit` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, which was `z / 4`. Since `delit` must be greater than or equal to 1, after decrementing by 1, `delit` will still satisfy this condition. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= y <= 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= z <= 1000, `delit` is equal to `z / 4 - 1` and `delit` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either `y / delit < 1` or `x / delit < 1`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= y <= 1000, `z` is a non-negative integer such that 4 <= z <= 1000, `delit` is equal to `z / 4 - 1` and `delit` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either `y / (z / 4 - 1) < 1` or `x / (z / 4 - 1) < 1**
