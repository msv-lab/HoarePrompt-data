The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, all of which are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 1000\). The function aims to find the largest integer `delit` such that \(\frac{z}{4} - k \geq 1\) and \(\frac{y}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\) and \(\frac{x}{\frac{z}{4} - k} \geq 1\), where `k` is an integer starting from `z / 4` and decrementing until it satisfies the conditions or reaches 0. If no such `delit` exists, the function returns 0.
