The code `count[b - 1] += 1` increments the value of `count[b - 1]` by 1. Given the initial state, `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, and `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1, `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 2. 

Since `count[b - 1]` was already incremented by 2 in the initial state, incrementing it by 1 more will make it equal to the initial value plus 3. So, `count[b - 1]` is now `count[b - 1] + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1, `count[b - 1]` is `count[b - 1] + 3`**
