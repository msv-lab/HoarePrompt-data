The code `count[b - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `b - 1` in the list `count` by 1. Given that `a` is an input integer, the element at index `a - 1` in the list `count` was previously incremented by 1. Now, the element at index `b - 1` is incremented by 1.

Since `b` is an input integer, the exact value of the element at index `b - 1` depends on the value of `b`. However, we know that before this operation, the list `count` had an element at index `a - 1` that was incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `m` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `i` is 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- The list `count` has an element at index `a - 1` that was incremented by 1, and now the element at index `b - 1` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, count[b - 1] += 1**
