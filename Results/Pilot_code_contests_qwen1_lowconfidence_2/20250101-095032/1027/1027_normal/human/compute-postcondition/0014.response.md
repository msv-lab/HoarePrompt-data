Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `count` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(m):
    a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count[a - 1] += 1
    count[b - 1] += 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution and Updates**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, the inputs `a` and `b` are taken as integers.
   - The value at `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1.
   - The value at `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Final Values After All Iterations**:
   - The loop runs `m` times, where `m` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` entered.
   - Each pair increments the count at indices `a-1` and `b-1` in the `count` list.
   - Since the loop runs exactly `m` times, `i` will take all values from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Variables After the Loop**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is also part of the initial state.
   - `i` is not relevant to the final state since it just ranges from 0 to `m-1`.
   - `a` and `b` are dependent on the input and thus cannot be determined without specific input values.
   - `count` will contain the counts of how many times each index was incremented.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Since `m` is between 2 and 50, the maximum possible value for `count[i]` would be `m` (if each index was incremented `m` times).

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains between 2 and 50.
- `m` remains between 2 and 50.
- `count` is a list of length `n` where each element represents the number of times the corresponding index was incremented.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `count` is a list of length `n` where each element is between 0 and `m` (inclusive).**
