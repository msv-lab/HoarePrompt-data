The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation, and the value of `i` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
