`count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `a` is an integer entered by the user, so `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1 (originally incremented by 1), `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1, `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 2**
