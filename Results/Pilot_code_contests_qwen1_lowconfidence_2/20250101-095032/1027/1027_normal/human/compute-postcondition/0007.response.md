The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. This directly updates the values of `a` and `b`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, and `count`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `count[b - 1] += 1` is executed at the end of the previous iteration.

After executing the code, the updated states are:
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `count[b - 1] += 1`**
