`count[a - 1]` is assigned the value of `count[a - 1] + 1`. The value of `a` is an input integer, so `count[a - 1]` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected. The value of `count[b - 1]` is also incremented by 1 according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1, `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 1**
