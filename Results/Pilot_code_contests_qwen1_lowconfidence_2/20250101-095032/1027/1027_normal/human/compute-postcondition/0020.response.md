`print(count[i])` prints the value of `count[i]`. Since `i` is 2, the code will print `count[2]`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is unspecified, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `count` is defined, prints the value of `count[2]`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `count` is defined, prints the value of `count[2]`**
