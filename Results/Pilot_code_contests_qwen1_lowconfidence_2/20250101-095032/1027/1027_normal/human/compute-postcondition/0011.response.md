The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the input values are converted to integers using `int`, the variables `a` and `b` will hold these integer values.

The initial state of the variables is:
- `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `m` is greater than 3
- `i` is 3
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1
- `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 2

After executing the code, the variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the two integers entered by the user, and the `count` list will be updated according to the values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `m` is greater than 3
- `i` is 3
- `a` is the first integer entered by the user
- `b` is the second integer entered by the user
- `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1
- `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 2

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `count[a - 1]` is incremented by 1, `count[b - 1]` is incremented by 2**
