The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The problem constraints and relationships are given but do not involve any input parameters being passed to the function. The output is described in two cases:

- Case_1: The function returns an error message stating that the constraints for N and M are not satisfied (2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50).
- Case_2: The function returns a description of the relationships between the integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and a_i ≠ b_i).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to check if the given constraints for N and M are satisfied. If the constraints are not met, it returns an error message. If the constraints are met, it returns a description of the relationships between the integers a_i and b_i.
