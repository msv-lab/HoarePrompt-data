State before the loop starts: According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the value of `i` is 0 because `xrange(n)` starts generating values from 0 up to but not including `n`.

So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
