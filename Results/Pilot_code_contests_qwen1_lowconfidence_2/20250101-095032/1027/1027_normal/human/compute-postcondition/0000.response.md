The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, they are represented as `n` and `m` respectively. The precondition that 2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50 and the relationships between `a_i` and `b_i` for each i in range 1 to M are still valid after the code execution, but the specific values of `a_i` and `b_i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, and for each i in range 1 to m, a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i; n and m are assigned the values from input**
