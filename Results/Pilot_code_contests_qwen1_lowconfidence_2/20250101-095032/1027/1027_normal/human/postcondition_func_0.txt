The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from the input, where \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\). It then processes \(M\) pairs of integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) (where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N\) and \(a_i \neq b_i\)) to increment the counts of the corresponding indices in a list `count`. Finally, it prints the values in the `count` list. If the input values do not satisfy the constraints \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\), the function will terminate without performing any operations. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the counts. Potential edge cases include when \(N = 0\) or \(M = 0\), in which case no pairs are processed, and the function simply prints empty counts. The function also assumes valid input within the specified constraints, and no error checking is performed beyond the initial validation.
