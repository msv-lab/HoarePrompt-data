Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It reads the number of cities \(N\) and roads \(M\), then processes each road to increment the count of connections for both cities involved. Finally, it prints the count of roads connected to each city. The code handles all given examples and potential cases within the specified constraints. Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all given examples correctly, the correctness is True.
