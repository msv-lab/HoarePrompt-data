Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the number of roads connected to each city based on the given constraints. The program initializes a list `count` to store the number of roads for each city, then iterates over each road, incrementing the count for both cities involved. Finally, it prints the count for each city. The output hints confirm that the program processes the input as described and handles the constraints appropriately. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, the final assessment remains True.
