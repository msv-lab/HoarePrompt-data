Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of roads connected to each city. It initializes a list `count` to store the number of roads for each city, then iterates over each road, incrementing the count for both cities involved. Finally, it prints the count for each city. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach will work for all valid inputs. There are no potential edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided problem description and examples.
