Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of cities (`N`) and the number of roads (`M`) from the input. It uses `map(int, raw_input().split())` to split the first line into two integers, which is appropriate given the constraints.

2. **Initialization of Counters**: A list `count` of size `N` initialized to zeros is used to keep track of the number of roads connected to each city. This is done with `count = [0] * n`.

3. **Processing Each Road**: For each of the `M` roads, the program reads the cities connected by the road (`a` and `b`). It increments the count for both cities (`a - 1` and `b - 1`) by 1. This ensures that each road is counted twice, once for each city it connects.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the count of roads for each city in the required format. This is achieved by iterating over the `count` list and printing each element.

Given these steps, the program accurately computes and outputs the number of roads connected to each city as specified in the problem description. The assumptions about valid input ensure that the program behaves correctly within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct and will meet the requirements for any valid input.
