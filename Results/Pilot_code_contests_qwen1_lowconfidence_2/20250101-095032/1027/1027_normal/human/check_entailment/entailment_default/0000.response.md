Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function correctly implements the problem description. It reads the number of cities \(N\) and roads \(M\), then processes each road to increment the count of connections for both cities involved. Finally, it prints the count of roads connected to each city. The function handles all potential cases within the given constraints and correctly computes the required output. The output hints align with the function's behavior, and there are no edge cases or examples provided that would make the program incorrect.
