You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N cities and M roads. The i-th road (1≤i≤M) connects two cities a_i and b_i (1≤a_i,b_i≤N) bidirectionally. There may be more than one road that connects the same pair of two cities. For each city, how many roads are connected to the city?

Constraints

* 2≤N,M≤50
* 1≤a_i,b_i≤N

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Program:

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count = [0] * n
    for i in xrange(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        count[a - 1] += 1
        count[b - 1] += 1
    for i in xrange(n):
        print(count[i])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of roads connected to each city. It initializes a list `count` to store the number of connections for each city. For each road specified in the input, it increments the count for both cities involved. Finally, it prints the count for each city as required. Given the constraints and the problem description, this implementation handles all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers such that 2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50, and for each i in range 1 to M, a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and a_i ≠ b_i.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count = [0] * n
    for i in xrange(m):
        a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        count[a - 1] += 1
        
        count[b - 1] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    for i in xrange(n):
        print(count[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information and the loop code:
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is a positive integer.
    #- `count` is a list or an array.
    #- `i` starts at 0.
    #- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```python
    #for i in xrange(n):
    #    print(count[i])
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis of the Loop
    #
    ##### After the Loop Executes 1 Time
    #- `i` is 0.
    #- `n` must be greater than 0.
    #- An error (NameError) is raised if `count` is not defined.
    #
    ##### After the Loop Executes 2 Times
    #- `i` is 1.
    #- `n` must be greater than 0.
    #- `count` is defined, and it contains at least 2 elements.
    #
    ##### After the Loop Executes 3 Times
    #- `i` is 2.
    #- `n` must be greater than 0.
    #- `count` is defined, and it contains at least 3 elements.
    #
    #From the above observations, we can infer that the loop will continue to run until `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `n` times if `n > 0`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #- If the loop executes `n` times:
    #  - `i` will be `n - 1`.
    #  - `count` will be a list or array of length `n`.
    #  - All elements of `count` from index 0 to `n-1` will have been printed.
    #  
    #- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n == 0`):
    #  - `i` remains 0.
    #  - `count` is not referenced because the loop condition is not met.
    #  
    #### Conclusion
    #The final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished (assuming `n > 0`) is:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is `n - 1`.
    #- `count` is a list or array of length `n`.
    #- All elements of `count` from index 0 to `n-1` have been printed.
    #- If `n == 0`, `i` remains 0 and `count` is not referenced.
    #
    #If `n == 0`, the variables `i` and `count` remain as initially described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from the input, where \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\). It then processes \(M\) pairs of integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) (where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N\) and \(a_i \neq b_i\)) to increment the counts of the corresponding indices in a list `count`. Finally, it prints the values in the `count` list. If the input values do not satisfy the constraints \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\), the function will terminate without performing any operations. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the counts. Potential edge cases include when \(N = 0\) or \(M = 0\), in which case no pairs are processed, and the function simply prints empty counts. The function also assumes valid input within the specified constraints, and no error checking is performed beyond the initial validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
