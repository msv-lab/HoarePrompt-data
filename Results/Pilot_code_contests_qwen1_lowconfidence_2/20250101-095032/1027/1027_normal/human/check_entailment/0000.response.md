Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of roads connected to each city. It initializes a list `count` to store the number of connections for each city. For each road specified in the input, it increments the count for both cities involved. Finally, it prints the count for each city as required. Given the constraints and the problem description, this implementation handles all potential cases correctly.
