Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Constraints Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from the input using `raw_input()`. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that these integers represent the number of cities and roads, respectively.
   - The constraints \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\) are implicitly handled by the input format and the assumption that valid input will be provided.

2. **Initialization and Counting**:
   - A list `count` of size \(N\) is initialized with zeros. Each element in this list will eventually hold the number of roads connected to the corresponding city.
   - The program then iterates over \(M\) pairs of integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\), reading them from the input. For each pair, it increments the count of both cities \(a_i - 1\) and \(b_i - 1\) in the `count` list. This ensures that the count accurately reflects the number of roads connected to each city.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - After processing all the road connections, the program prints the contents of the `count` list, one element per line. This outputs the number of roads connected to each city, exactly as required by the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases and Assumptions**:
   - The program assumes that the input is valid and within the specified constraints. While it does not explicitly check for these constraints, the program's behavior is well-defined for inputs satisfying the constraints. For example, if \(N = 0\) or \(M = 0\), the program will still read the input but will produce an empty list as the output, which is consistent with the problem description's expectation.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles the expected input correctly, the correctness is **True**.
