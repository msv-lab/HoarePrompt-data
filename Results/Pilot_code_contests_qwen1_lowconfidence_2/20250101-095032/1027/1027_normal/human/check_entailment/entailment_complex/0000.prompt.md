You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N cities and M roads. The i-th road (1≤i≤M) connects two cities a_i and b_i (1≤a_i,b_i≤N) bidirectionally. There may be more than one road that connects the same pair of two cities. For each city, how many roads are connected to the city?

Constraints

* 2≤N,M≤50
* 1≤a_i,b_i≤N
* a_i ≠ b_i
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
a_1 b_1
:
a_M b_M


Output

Print the answer in N lines. In the i-th line (1≤i≤N), print the number of roads connected to city i.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers such that 2 ≤ N, M ≤ 50, and for each i in range 1 to M, a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and a_i ≠ b_i.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    count = [0] * n
    for i in xrange(m):
        a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        count[a - 1] += 1
        
        count[b - 1] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    for i in xrange(n):
        print(count[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information and the loop code:
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is a positive integer.
    #- `count` is a list or an array.
    #- `i` starts at 0.
    #- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```python
    #for i in xrange(n):
    #    print(count[i])
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis of the Loop
    #
    ##### After the Loop Executes 1 Time
    #- `i` is 0.
    #- `n` must be greater than 0.
    #- An error (NameError) is raised if `count` is not defined.
    #
    ##### After the Loop Executes 2 Times
    #- `i` is 1.
    #- `n` must be greater than 0.
    #- `count` is defined, and it contains at least 2 elements.
    #
    ##### After the Loop Executes 3 Times
    #- `i` is 2.
    #- `n` must be greater than 0.
    #- `count` is defined, and it contains at least 3 elements.
    #
    #From the above observations, we can infer that the loop will continue to run until `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `n` times if `n > 0`.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #- If the loop executes `n` times:
    #  - `i` will be `n - 1`.
    #  - `count` will be a list or array of length `n`.
    #  - All elements of `count` from index 0 to `n-1` will have been printed.
    #  
    #- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n == 0`):
    #  - `i` remains 0.
    #  - `count` is not referenced because the loop condition is not met.
    #  
    #### Conclusion
    #The final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished (assuming `n > 0`) is:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `i` is `n - 1`.
    #- `count` is a list or array of length `n`.
    #- All elements of `count` from index 0 to `n-1` have been printed.
    #- If `n == 0`, `i` remains 0 and `count` is not referenced.
    #
    #If `n == 0`, the variables `i` and `count` remain as initially described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from the input, where \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\). It then processes \(M\) pairs of integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) (where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N\) and \(a_i \neq b_i\)) to increment the counts of the corresponding indices in a list `count`. Finally, it prints the values in the `count` list. If the input values do not satisfy the constraints \(2 \leq N, M \leq 50\), the function will terminate without performing any operations. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the counts. Potential edge cases include when \(N = 0\) or \(M = 0\), in which case no pairs are processed, and the function simply prints empty counts. The function also assumes valid input within the specified constraints, and no error checking is performed beyond the initial validation.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
