`nk` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `nk` was previously `0`, so it has changed to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least one element, `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is `1`, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the first element in `lst1`; the output is 1 followed by `i`.
