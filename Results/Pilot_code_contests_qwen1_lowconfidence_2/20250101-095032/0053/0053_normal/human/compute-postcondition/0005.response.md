The code `nk = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `nk`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is to the variable `nk`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the string input and converting each element to an integer, `nk` is 0.**
