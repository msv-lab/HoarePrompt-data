The code `break` is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement that is being explicitly shown, we can infer that the `break` statement is exiting some kind of loop or conditional context that was previously defined but not shown here.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `break` statement is used, we know the following:
- `i` is the next element in `lst1` and must be an element of `lst2`.
- 'YES' is printed to the console.
- `1 i` is printed to the console.
- `nk` is 1.

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables and simply exits the loop or conditional block, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output of the `break` statement itself is not printed or returned.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `lst1` and must be an element of `lst2`; 'YES' is printed to the console, and `1 i` is printed to the console; `nk` is 1.**
