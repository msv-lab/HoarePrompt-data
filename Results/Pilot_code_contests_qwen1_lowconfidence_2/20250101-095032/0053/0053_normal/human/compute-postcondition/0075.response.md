According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst1`. For the loop to execute again, `lst1` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element
- `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)
- `nk` is `1`
- The console displays 'YES' followed by `1`, `2`, or `3` (depending on which element of `lst2` is found in `lst1`)

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst1` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that the condition for `lst1` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is `1`, and the console displays 'YES' followed by `1`, `2`, or `3` (depending on which element of `lst2` is found in `lst1`).**
