The code `print(1, i)` prints the value 1 followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the first element in `lst1` and its current value is also in `lst2`, the print statement will output 1 followed by `i`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`, 'NO', and the remaining number of iterations are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least one element, `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 0, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the first element in `lst1`; the output is 1 followed by `i`.**
