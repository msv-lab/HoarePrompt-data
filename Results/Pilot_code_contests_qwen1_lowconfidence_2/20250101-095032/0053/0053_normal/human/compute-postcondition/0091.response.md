Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), for each iteration, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set of integers from the input string, `nk` is 0, and 'NO' is printed if no common elements are found. If a common element is found, 'YES' is printed followed by the common element and `nk` becomes 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times based on the value of `t`.
- For each iteration, the loop takes inputs `n` and `m` and splits them into two lists `lst1` and `lst2`.
- Both `lst1` and `lst2` are converted to sets to remove duplicates.
- The loop checks if there is any common element between `lst1` and `lst2`.
  - If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' and the common element, and sets `nk` to 1.
  - If no common element is found, it prints 'NO' and `nk` remains 0.
- After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be as described above, with `nk` being 1 if a common element was found in any iteration and 'NO' being printed otherwise.
