Functionality: **The function reads `t` test cases from standard input, where each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` and `m` integers respectively. For each test case, it converts the input lists into sets, then checks if there is at least one common element between the two sets. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the element; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `m` are 0 (though the problem constraints ensure \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\)), and when there are no common elements across all test cases, 'NO' will be printed for each case.**
