Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 1, and the console displays 'YES' followed by `1`, `2`, or `3` (depending on which element of `lst2` is found in `lst1`).**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `m` is the second integer input.
   - `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string.
   - `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\).
   - `nk` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `lst1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `i` is in `lst2`.
   - If `i` is found in `lst2`, it prints 'YES' followed by `i` (where `i` is 1, 2, or 3), sets `nk` to 1, and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `i` is not found in `lst2`, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `nk`.

3. **Final State After Loop Execution**:
   - Since the loop exits when `nk` is set to 1, the loop will always execute at least once.
   - `nk` will be 1.
   - The console will display 'YES' followed by one of the numbers `1`, `2`, or `3`, depending on which element from `lst2` was found in `lst1`.

Thus, the final output state is that `t` remains the same, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `lst1` remains the same, `lst2` remains the same, `nk` is 1, and the console will display 'YES' followed by one of `1`, `2`, or `3`.
