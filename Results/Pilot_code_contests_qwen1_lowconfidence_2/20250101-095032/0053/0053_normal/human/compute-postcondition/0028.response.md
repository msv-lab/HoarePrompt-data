Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` remains 0, no elements have been printed to the console.***

This postcondition reflects the initial state as described in the precondition and includes the condition that the if statement evaluates to true (i.e., `nk == 0`).
