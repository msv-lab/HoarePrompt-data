Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element.
- `lst2` is now a set containing the integers from the split string input.
- `nk` is 1.
- If `i` is in `lst2`, then the values 1 and `i` have been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Analysis
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `lst1` contains at least one element.
   - `lst2` contains some elements (integers).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `lst1`.

3. **Break Condition**:
   - If `i` is in `lst2`, the loop breaks.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - Since `lst1` contains at least one element, the loop can execute at least once.
   - After each iteration, `i` is taken from `lst1` and checked against `lst2`.
   - If `i` is found in `lst2`, the loop breaks and no further iterations occur.

### Step-by-Step Analysis for the Next Iteration
- At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has either completed all iterations or broken due to finding an `i` in `lst2`.
- If the loop did not break, the next `i` from `lst1` will be processed.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be updated is the current value of `i`.

### Updated States
- `t` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `lst1` remains the same because it is the source of the loop iterations.
- `lst2` remains the same as well.
- `nk` remains 1.
- The new value of `i` is the next element in `lst1` after the last processed element.

### Conclusion
Since the loop continues to the next element in `lst1` if it has not already broken, the only change is in the value of `i`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is now a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` is 1, and `i` is the next element in `lst1` after the last processed element.**
