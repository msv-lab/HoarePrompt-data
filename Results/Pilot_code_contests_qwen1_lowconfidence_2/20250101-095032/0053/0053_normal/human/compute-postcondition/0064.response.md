The code `lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes user input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `lst2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, and `nk` are not affected by this code.

Let's assume the user inputs a string like "1 2 3" for the `input()` function. This input would be split into individual strings ["1", "2", "3"], and each string would be converted to integers [1, 2, 3], which would then be assigned to `lst2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string, `lst2` is the list [1, 2, 3] (assuming the input was "1 2 3"), `nk` is 0**
