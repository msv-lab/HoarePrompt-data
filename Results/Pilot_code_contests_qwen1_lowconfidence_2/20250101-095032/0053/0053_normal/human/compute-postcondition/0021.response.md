Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: We don't have specific values for `lst1` and `lst2`, but we know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was an element of `lst2`. This means that if `i` was found in `lst2`, the loop body (which includes printing 'YES' and then 1 followed by `i`) would have executed. However, since no specific action was mentioned as having happened, we assume no such print occurred, meaning `i` was not found in `lst2`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, the current value of `i` should still be an element of `lst2`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: Since no specific change was made to the state in the loop body, the state remains the same as it was before the loop started, except that `i` is now the next element in `lst1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` must be an element of `lst2`.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted such that the next value of `i` (which is the next element in `lst1`) is still an element of `lst2`.

**State:**
- `i` is now the next element in `lst1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be an element of `lst2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `lst1` and must be an element of `lst2`**.
