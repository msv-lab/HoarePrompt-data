The code creates a new list `lst2` by splitting a string input and converting each element to an integer. The previous values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The `lst1` list from the initial state is not used in this code, so its value remains the same.

Let's denote the input string as `s`. After executing the line of code, `lst2` will contain integers converted from the elements of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the string input and converting each element to an integer.**
