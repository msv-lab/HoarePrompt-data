The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 0, `'NO'` is printed `int(input())` times, and the remaining number of iterations is 0 if the loop does not execute again.**
