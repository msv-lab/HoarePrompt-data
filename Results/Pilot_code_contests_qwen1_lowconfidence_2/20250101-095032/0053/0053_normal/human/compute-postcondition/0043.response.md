The code `break` is used to exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are currently inside. Given the initial state, no variables are updated or changed by the `break` statement. However, we know that the loop or if statement is exited.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least one element, `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is `1`, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the first element in `lst1`; the loop or if statement is exited.**
