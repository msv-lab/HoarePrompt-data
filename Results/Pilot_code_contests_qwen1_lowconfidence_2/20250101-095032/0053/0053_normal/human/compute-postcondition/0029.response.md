The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This action does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`, or any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables along with the fact that 'NO' was printed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` remains 0, 'NO' is printed to the console.**
