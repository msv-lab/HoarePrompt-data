Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - \( t \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \).
   - \( n \) is the first integer input.
   - \( m \) is the second integer input.
   - \( lst1 \) is a set of integers from the input string.
   - \( lst2 \) is a set containing the integers from the split string input.
   - \( nk \) remains 0.
   - 'NO' is printed to the console.

2. **Loop Analysis**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs based on user input. Specifically, the number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`.
   - Since the loop is driven by user input, we need to consider what happens to the state after one iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - After one iteration of the loop, the number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.
   - Therefore, the state after the first iteration will depend on the new value of `int(input())`, which reduces the number of remaining iterations by 1.

5. **Updated State**:
   - \( t \) remains within the range \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \).
   - \( n \) remains the same as the first integer input.
   - \( m \) remains the same as the second integer input.
   - \( lst1 \) remains the same as the set of integers from the input string.
   - \( lst2 \) remains the same as the set containing the integers from the split string input.
   - \( nk \) remains 0 (since the loop body is omitted and no operation changes it).
   - 'NO' is still printed to the console.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration would be:

- The remaining number of iterations is now `int(input()) - 1`.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` remains 0, and 'NO' is printed to the console, and the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.**
