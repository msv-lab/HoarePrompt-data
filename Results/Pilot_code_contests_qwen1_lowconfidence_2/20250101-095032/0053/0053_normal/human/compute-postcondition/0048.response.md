`nk` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `nk` does not depend on any previous value and is directly set to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least two elements (since the first element was already used in the previous iteration), `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 1, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the second element in `lst1`; 1 and `i` are printed.**
