The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 0, and `i` is an element of `lst2`. The console displays 'YES'**
