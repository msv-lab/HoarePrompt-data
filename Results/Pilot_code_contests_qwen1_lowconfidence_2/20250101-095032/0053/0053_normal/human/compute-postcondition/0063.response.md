The code snippet updates the list `lst1` by converting each element of the input string into an integer. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `lst2`, and `nk` remain unchanged.

Let's denote the input string as `input_str`. After executing the code, `lst1` will be a list of integers obtained by splitting `input_str` and converting each element to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 0**
