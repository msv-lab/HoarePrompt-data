The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, which removes duplicate elements. However, the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `lst1`, only that it is a list of integers. Since converting a list to a set changes its type from list to set, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the string input and converting each element to an integer, `nk` is 0.**
