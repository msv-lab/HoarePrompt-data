The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, removing any duplicate elements. Since the initial state specifies that `lst1` is a list of integers from an input string, converting it to a set will remove any duplicates.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string
- `lst2` is the list `[1, 2, 3]`
- `nk` is 0

After executing the code `lst1 = set(lst1)`, the list `lst1` is transformed into a set, but the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is the list [1, 2, 3], `nk` is 0**
