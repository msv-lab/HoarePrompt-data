The code `nk = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. The value of `nk` was previously 0, and this assignment changes it to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is now a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` is 1, and `i` is in `lst2`; the value 1 and `i` are printed.**
