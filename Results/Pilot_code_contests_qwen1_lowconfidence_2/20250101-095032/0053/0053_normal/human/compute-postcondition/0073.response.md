The code `break` does not affect any variable values directly. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned in the provided code snippet, the break statement does not change the values of any variables. The initial conditions remain valid after the execution.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is `1`, and the console displays 'YES' followed by `1` and `i` (where `i` is either 1, 2, or 3)**.
