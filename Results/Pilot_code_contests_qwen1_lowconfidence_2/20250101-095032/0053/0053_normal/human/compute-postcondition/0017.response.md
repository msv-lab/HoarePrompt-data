The code `print(1, i)` will print "1" followed by the value of `i`. However, since `i` is not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet, its value remains undefined. The initial state includes `print('YES')`, which means the first print statement will execute as is.

The output state will be:
- `print('YES')` is executed.
- `print(1, i)` is executed, where `i` retains its undefined state.

Output State: **print('YES'), print(1, i)**
