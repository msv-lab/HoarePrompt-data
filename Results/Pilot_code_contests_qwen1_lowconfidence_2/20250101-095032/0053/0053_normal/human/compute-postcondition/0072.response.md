`nk` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is `1`, and the console displays 'YES' followed by `1` and `i` (where `i` is either 1, 2, or 3).
