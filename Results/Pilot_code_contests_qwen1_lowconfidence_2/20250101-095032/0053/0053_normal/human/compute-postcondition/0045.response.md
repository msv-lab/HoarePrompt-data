According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the set `lst1`. The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least one element, `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 1, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the first element in `lst1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next element in `lst1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least two elements (since the first element was already used in the previous iteration), `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 1, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the second element in `lst1`**.
