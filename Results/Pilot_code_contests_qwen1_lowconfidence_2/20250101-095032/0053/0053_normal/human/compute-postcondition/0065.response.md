The code sets `nk` to 0, which means it initializes `nk` to this value. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, and `lst2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string, `lst2` is the list [1, 2, 3], `nk` is 0**
