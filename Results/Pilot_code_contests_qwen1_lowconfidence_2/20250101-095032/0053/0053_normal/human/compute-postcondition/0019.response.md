The `break` statement is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `print` statements are outside of any loop or conditional block, the `break` statement does not affect their execution. The `print` statements will still execute as originally written, and the `break` statement will simply cause any further execution of the nearest loop or conditional block to be halted.

The initial state is as follows:
- `print('YES')` is a print statement.
- `print(1, i)` is a print statement where `i` is an unspecified variable.

After the code is executed, the `print` statements will still run, but the `break` statement itself does not change any variable values or have an effect on the print statements.

Output State: **`print('YES')`, `print(1, i)`**
