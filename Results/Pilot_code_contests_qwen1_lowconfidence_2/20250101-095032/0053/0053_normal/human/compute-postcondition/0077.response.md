The code `print(1, i)` will print `1` followed by the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Based on the initial state, the output of the print statement will be `1` followed by the value of `i`, but since `i` is not defined, we cannot specify its value here. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is `1`, and the console displays '1' followed by the value of `i`.**
