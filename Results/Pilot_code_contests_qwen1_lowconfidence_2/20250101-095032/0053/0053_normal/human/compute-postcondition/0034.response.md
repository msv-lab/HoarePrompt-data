The code snippet converts the input split by spaces into a list of integers and assigns it to `lst2`. The other variables are not affected. The value of `lst2` will be a list of integers from the new input.

Let's denote the new input as `new_input`, which is a string of space-separated integers. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", then `lst2` will be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input; `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string; `lst2` is a list of integers from the new split string input; `nk` remains 0; 'NO' is printed; the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.**
