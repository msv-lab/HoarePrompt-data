The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` changes the type of `lst2` from a list to a set, but does not alter the elements within it. Since `lst2` was initially `[1, 2, 3]`, converting it to a set will remove any duplicates (if there were any) and change its structure. However, in this case, there are no duplicates, so the set will simply be `{1, 2, 3}`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is the set {1, 2, 3}, `nk` is 0**
