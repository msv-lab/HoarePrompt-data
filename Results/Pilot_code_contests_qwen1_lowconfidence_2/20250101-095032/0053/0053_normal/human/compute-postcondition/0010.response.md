The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is now a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` is 0, and `i` is in `lst2`**
