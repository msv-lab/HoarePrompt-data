The `break` statement does not affect the values of variables but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code, the only effect is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional context if it was inside one. However, since no such context is mentioned in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least two elements, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 1, and the console displays 'YES', and the print statement outputs `1` followed by a space.**
