Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 0, `'NO'` is printed `int(input())` times, and the remaining number of iterations is 0 if the loop does not execute again.**
