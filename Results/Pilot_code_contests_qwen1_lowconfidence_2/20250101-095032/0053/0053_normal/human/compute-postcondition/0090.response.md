Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), and `nk` is 0. If any element of `lst2` is found in `lst1`, the console displays 'YES' followed by `1`, `2`, or `3`. Otherwise, the console displays 'NO'.***
