Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is now a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` is 1, and if `i` is in `lst2`, then the values 1 and `i` have been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
