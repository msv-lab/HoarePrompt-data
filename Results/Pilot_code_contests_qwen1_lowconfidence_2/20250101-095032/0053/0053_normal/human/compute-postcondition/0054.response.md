The code `nk = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. Since `nk` was already 1 before this line, the value does not change. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least three elements, `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 1, "NO" is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 3`, `i` is 1**
