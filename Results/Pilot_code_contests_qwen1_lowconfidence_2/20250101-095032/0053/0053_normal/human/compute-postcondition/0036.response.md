The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, which removes duplicate elements from the list. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `lst1`, the only change is that `lst1` is now a set with no duplicates. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input; `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string; `lst2` is a list of integers from the new split string input; `nk` is 0; 'NO' is printed; the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.**
