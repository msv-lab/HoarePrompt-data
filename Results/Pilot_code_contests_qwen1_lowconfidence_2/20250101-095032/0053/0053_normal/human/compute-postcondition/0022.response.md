The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or change their values. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `lst1` and must be an element of `lst2`; 'YES' is printed to the console**
