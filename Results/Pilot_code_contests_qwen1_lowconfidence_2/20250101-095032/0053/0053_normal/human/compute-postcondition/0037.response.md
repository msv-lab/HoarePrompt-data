The code snippet `lst2 = set(lst2)` changes the type of `lst2` from a list to a set. However, the values in the set remain the same as those originally in the list. The initial state specifies that `lst2` is a list of integers from a new split string input. After converting `lst2` to a set, the elements in `lst2` remain the same, but the data structure changes.

The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input; `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string; `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input; `nk` is 0; 'NO' is printed; the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.**
