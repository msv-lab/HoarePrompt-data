The code creates a list `lst1` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. This means that `lst1` will contain integers from the input string, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string.**
