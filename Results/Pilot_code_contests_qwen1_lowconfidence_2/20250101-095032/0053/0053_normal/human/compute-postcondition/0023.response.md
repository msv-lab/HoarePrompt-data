`i` is printed to the console with the prefix `1`. The value of `i` is still the next element in `lst1` and must be an element of `lst2`. The statement `YES` is printed to the console, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is the next element in `lst1` and must be an element of `lst2`; 'YES' is printed to the console, and `1 i` is printed to the console.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `lst1` and must be an element of `lst2`; 'YES' is printed to the console, and `1 i` is printed to the console.**
