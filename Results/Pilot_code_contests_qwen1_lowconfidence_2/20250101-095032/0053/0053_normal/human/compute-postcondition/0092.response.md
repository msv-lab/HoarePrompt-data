The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in its definition. Instead, it processes input data from standard input. The function reads `t` lines of input, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of two lines of input: the first line contains two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, representing the lengths of two arrays. The second and third lines of each test case contain `n` and `m` integers respectively, where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000. The sum of all `n` across all test cases and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).

The function then processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided data.

Functionality: **The function reads `t` test cases from standard input, where each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` and `m` integers respectively. It processes this input and returns a result based on the provided data.**
