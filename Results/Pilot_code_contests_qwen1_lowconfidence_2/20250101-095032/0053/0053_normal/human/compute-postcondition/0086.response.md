Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least two elements, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 1, and the console displays 'YES' if `i` is in `lst2`, otherwise the console does not display anything (since there is no else part). The print statement outputs `1` followed by a space if `i` is in `lst2`.***
