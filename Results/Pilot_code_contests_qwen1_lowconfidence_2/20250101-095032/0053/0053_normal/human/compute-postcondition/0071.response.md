The code `print(1, i)` prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is an element of the set `lst2` which is `{1, 2, 3}`, the value of `i` could be `1`, `2`, or `3`. However, since the console displays 'YES', it implies that this line of code is being executed without any errors, and `i` is a valid element of `lst2`.

The output of the print statement is `1` followed by the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 0, and the console displays 'YES' followed by `1` and `i` (where `i` is either 1, 2, or 3).**
