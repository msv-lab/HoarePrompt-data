The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. It also mentions `lst1` and `lst2`, but these sets are not affected by this line of code. Additionally, the variable `nk` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged.

After executing the line `n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]`, the variables `n` and `m` will hold the integer values of the first and second inputs, respectively, while `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `lst1` and `lst2` remain as they were before.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 0**
