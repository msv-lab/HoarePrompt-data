The code `lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `lst1`. The variables `n`, `m`, `lst2`, `nk`, and the print statement 'NO' remain unchanged.

Let's denote the input for the `input()` function as `str_input`, which contains space-separated integers. After splitting and converting, `lst1` will contain these integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input; `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string; `lst2` is a set containing the integers from the split string input; `nk` remains 0; 'NO' is printed; the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.**
