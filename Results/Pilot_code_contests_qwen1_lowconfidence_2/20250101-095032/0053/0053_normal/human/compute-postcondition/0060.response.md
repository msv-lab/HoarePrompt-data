Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 0, and `'NO'` is printed `int(input())` times. The remaining number of iterations is 0 if the loop does not execute again. Since the if condition is `nk == 0` and the else part is not provided, the overall postcondition remains the same as the if part's postcondition.***
