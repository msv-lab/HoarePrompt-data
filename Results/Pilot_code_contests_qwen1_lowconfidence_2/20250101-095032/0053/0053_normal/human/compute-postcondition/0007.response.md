The code snippet `lst2 = set(lst2)` changes the type of `lst2` from a list to a set while keeping the elements of `lst2` the same. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is now a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` is 0.**
