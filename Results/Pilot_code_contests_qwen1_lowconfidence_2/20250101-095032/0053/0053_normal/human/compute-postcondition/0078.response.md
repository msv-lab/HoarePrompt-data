The code `nk = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. The value of `nk` was not specified in the initial state, so it is now explicitly set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 1, and the console displays '1' followed by the value of `i`.**
