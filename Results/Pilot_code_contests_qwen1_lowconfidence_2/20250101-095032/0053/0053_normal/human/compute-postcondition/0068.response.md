To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the structure of the for loop.

Given:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- `lst1` is a set of integers from an input string
- `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)
- `nk` is 0

The for loop is structured as follows:
```python
for i in lst1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, and `nk` are already initialized with their respective values.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `lst1` must contain at least one element.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since `lst1` is the set of integers from the input string, we need to ensure that this set is non-empty. If `lst1` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - There are no other variables or conditions in the loop that require adjustment based on the given information.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, `lst1` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element
- `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)
- `nk` is 0

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 0**
