Let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables step by step. The loop iterates over each element in `lst1` and checks if that element is present in `lst2`. If an element from `lst1` is found in `lst2`, the loop breaks, and the program prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the element `i`. If none of the elements in `lst1` are found in `lst2`, the loop will not execute, and the program will print 'NO'.

### Analysis of the Loop:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `n` is the first integer input.
  - `m` is the second integer input.
  - `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string.
  - `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input.
  - `nk` is initialized to 0.
  - `'NO'` is printed initially.
  - The remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`.
  - For each element `i` in `lst1`, it checks if `i` is in `lst2`.
  - If `i` is found in `lst2`, it prints 'YES', prints '1' and `i`, sets `nk` to 1, and breaks the loop.
  - If the loop completes without finding any element in `lst2`, `nk` remains 0.

### Final Output State After All Iterations:

- **If the loop executes at least once**:
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `n` is the first integer input.
  - `m` is the second integer input.
  - `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string.
  - `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input.
  - `nk` is 1 (indicating that an element from `lst1` was found in `lst2`).
  - `'NO'` is printed only once.
  - The remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1` (indicating that at least one iteration has occurred).

- **If the loop does not execute** (i.e., none of the elements in `lst1` are found in `lst2`):
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `n` is the first integer input.
  - `m` is the second integer input.
  - `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string.
  - `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input.
  - `nk` is 0 (indicating that no element from `lst1` was found in `lst2`).
  - `'NO'` is printed `int(input())` times.
  - The remaining number of iterations is 0.

### Conclusion:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string, `lst2` is a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether an element from `lst1` was found in `lst2`, `'NO'` is printed `int(input())` times, and the remaining number of iterations is 0 if the loop does not execute again.**
