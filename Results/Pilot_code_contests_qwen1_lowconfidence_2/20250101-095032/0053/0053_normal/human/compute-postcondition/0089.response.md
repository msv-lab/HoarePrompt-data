The code prints 'NO' to the console. This impacts the console display but does not affect the values of the variables themselves. The console will now display 'NO' instead of 'YES' followed by `1`, `2`, or `3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 0, and the console displays 'NO'.**
