Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least one element, `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 1, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the first element in `lst1`; if `i` is found in `lst2`, the loop or if statement is exited.***
