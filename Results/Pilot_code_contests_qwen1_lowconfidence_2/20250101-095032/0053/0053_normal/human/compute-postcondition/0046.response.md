The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables but changes the output that will be produced when this line of code is executed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least two elements (since the first element was already used in the previous iteration), `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 1, 'NO' is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`, and `i` is the second element in `lst1`. Output: YES**
