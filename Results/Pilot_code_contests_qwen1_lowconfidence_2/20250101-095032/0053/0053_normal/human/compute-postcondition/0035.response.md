The line of code `nk = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `nk`. The value of `nk` was previously `0`, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, and the remaining number of iterations) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input; `lst1` is a list of integers from the input string; `lst2` is a list of integers from the new split string input; `nk` is 0; 'NO' is printed; the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.**
