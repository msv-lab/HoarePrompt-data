The code `print(1, i)` prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is already defined in the initial state as being part of `lst2`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement itself and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least one element, `lst2` is now a set containing the integers from the split string input, `nk` is 0, and `i` is in `lst2`; the value 1 and `i` are printed.**
