The code `nk = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string that must contain at least two elements, `lst2` is the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), `nk` is 1, and the console displays 'YES', and the print statement outputs `1` followed by a space.**
