The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input.**
