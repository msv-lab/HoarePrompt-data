Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `m` is the second integer input.
   - `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least two elements.
   - `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input.
   - `nk` is 1.
   - "NO" is printed.
   - The remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - If the second element in `lst1` (`i`) is in `lst2`, the loop or conditional block is exited. Otherwise, no additional changes are made and the loop or conditional block is exited.

2. **For Loop Context:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `lst1`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `lst1` to iterate over.

4. **Current Iteration Details:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in `lst1` (since the first element was already used in the previous iteration).
   - `lst2` contains newly split integers.
   - "NO" is printed.
   - The remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.

5. **Next Iteration Adjustment:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the third element in `lst1` (if `lst1` has at least three elements).
   - `lst2` remains the same.
   - "NO" is printed.
   - The remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 2`.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input string that must have at least three elements (since the second element was already used in the previous iteration), `lst2` is now a set of integers from the new split string input, `nk` is 1, "NO" is printed, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 2`.**

If `i` is the third element in `lst1` and it is not in `lst2`, the loop continues. If `i` is the third element in `lst1` and it is in `lst2`, the loop or conditional block is exited.
