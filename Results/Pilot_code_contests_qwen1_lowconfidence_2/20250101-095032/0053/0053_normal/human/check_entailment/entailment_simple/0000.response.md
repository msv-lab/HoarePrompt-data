Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem description requires finding a non-empty subsequence that is common to both input arrays. However, the current implementation only checks for common elements and outputs a single common element if found. This does not guarantee that the output is the shortest possible subsequence that is a common subsequence of both arrays.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Single Common Element**: The program only prints a single common element if found. For example, if the input arrays are `[10, 8, 6, 4]` and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the common element is `4`. While this is a valid common element, it is not necessarily the shortest common subsequence. The shortest common subsequence could be longer if there are other common elements that form a shorter sequence.

2. **Subsequence Requirement**: The problem description requires finding a non-empty subsequence, which means the output should be a sequence of elements from the input arrays that maintains the relative order. The current program does not ensure that the output is a subsequence of both arrays.

To illustrate with an example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 5
  10 8 6 4
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  1 4
  ```

- Current Output:
  ```
  YES
  1 4
  ```

This is correct, but consider another example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 5
  10 8 6 4
  4 5 3 2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  2 4 10
  ```

- Current Output:
  ```
  YES
  1 4
  ```

In this case, the program outputs a single element `4`, but the shortest common subsequence is `[4, 10]`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to identify the longest common subsequence, which might require a more complex algorithm like dynamic programming.
