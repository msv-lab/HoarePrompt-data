Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies if there is at least one common element between the two sets `lst1` and `lst2`, which would form a valid subsequence of both arrays. If such an element exists, it prints "YES" followed by the element itself. If no common elements exist, it prints "NO". This approach handles all potential cases described in the problem statement. Here's a brief analysis:

1. **Handling Common Elements**: The program uses sets to find common elements between `lst1` and `lst2`. If a common element is found, it prints "YES" and the element, ensuring the subsequence is valid.
2. **No Common Elements**: If no common elements are found, the program prints "NO", correctly indicating that no valid subsequence exists.
3. **Smallest Possible Length**: Since the program only needs to check for the existence of a common element and doesn't need to find the smallest subsequence, this requirement is inherently satisfied by checking for the presence of any common element.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases like empty inputs and different lengths of arrays. It only checks for common elements, making it robust against these scenarios.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
