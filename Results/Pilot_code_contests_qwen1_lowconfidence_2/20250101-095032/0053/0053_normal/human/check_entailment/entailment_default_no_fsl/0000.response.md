Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where the smallest common subsequence has more than one element. According to the problem description, if there are multiple answers, we need to find one of the smallest possible length. The current implementation only checks for the presence of any common element and prints it without considering its length or whether there are other common elements of the same minimum length. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3 3
1 2 3
3 2 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
YES
1 3
```

However, the current code would not produce this output because it only checks for the presence of a common element and prints the first one it finds, which could be longer than necessary if there are multiple common elements of the same minimum length.

To fix this, the code needs to identify all common elements, sort them by their first occurrence index in the original lists (to get the shortest possible subsequence), and then choose the smallest one.
