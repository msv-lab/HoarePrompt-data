You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two arrays of integers a_1,…,a_n and b_1,…,b_m.

Your task is to find a non-empty array c_1,…,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,…,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,…,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the lengths of the two arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1,…,b_m (1≤ b_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i≤ 1000).

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if a solution exists, or "NO" otherwise.

If the answer is "YES", on the next line output an integer k (1≤ k≤ 1000) — the length of the array, followed by k integers c_1,…,c_k (1≤ c_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions with the smallest possible k, output any.

Output


YES
1 4
YES
1 3
NO
YES
1 3
YES
1 2

Note

In the first test case, [4] is a subsequence of [10, 8, 6, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This array has length 1, it is the smallest possible length of a subsequence of both a and b.

In the third test case, no non-empty subsequences of both [3] and [2] exist, so the answer is "NO".
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        nk = 0
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')


```
Output hints: The function reads `t` test cases from standard input, where each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` and `m` integers respectively. For each test case, it converts the input lists into sets, then checks if there is at least one common element between the two sets. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the element; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `m` are 0 (though the problem constraints ensure \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\)), and when there are no common elements across all test cases, 'NO' will be printed for each case.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
