Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code checks for common elements between the two sets `lst1` and `lst2` by converting the input lists into sets. While this approach correctly identifies common elements, it does not guarantee that the identified common elements form a non-empty subsequence in both lists. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
2
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
```
- Expected output:
```
YES
1 4
YES
1 3
```
- Actual output:
```
YES
1 4
NO
```

The code correctly identifies `4` as a common element between the two sets in the first test case, but it incorrectly reports "NO" for the second test case because `3` is a common element and forms a subsequence in both lists `[1000, 2, 2, 2, 3]` and `[3, 1, 5]`.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
