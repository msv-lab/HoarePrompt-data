Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Subsequence Requirement**: The problem requires finding a subsequence that is common to both arrays, not just a common element. However, the program simply checks for common elements between the two sets and prints 'YES' followed by any common element if found. It does not check if the common element forms a subsequence in both arrays.

2. **Smallest Possible Length**: The program does not guarantee that the solution is the shortest possible subsequence. It only finds any common element, which might not be part of the shortest subsequence.

To illustrate with an example:
- Consider the following inputs:
  ```
  2
  4 5
  10 8 6 4
  1 2 3 4 5
  5 3
  1000 2 2 2 3
  3 1 5
  ```

  - For the first test case, the program correctly identifies `4` as a common element and prints `YES 1 4`.
  - For the second test case, the program correctly identifies `3` as a common element and prints `YES 1 3`.

However, consider another example where the program fails:
- Inputs:
  ```
  1
  3 3
  1 2 3
  3 2 1
  ```

  - The common elements are `1`, `2`, and `3`. The program would print `YES 1 1` or `YES 1 2` or `YES 1 3`, but the correct answer should be any of `[1], [2], [3]`, and specifically, `[1]` is the shortest common subsequence.

To correct the program, you would need to:
1. Find all common elements between the two sets.
2. For each common element, check if it forms a subsequence in both arrays.
3. Among the valid subsequences, select the shortest one.
4. If no valid subsequence is found, print 'NO'.

The current implementation only checks for the existence of a common element, which does not satisfy the full requirements of the problem.
