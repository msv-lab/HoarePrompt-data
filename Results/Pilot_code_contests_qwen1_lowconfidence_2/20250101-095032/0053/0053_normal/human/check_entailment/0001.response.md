Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the smallest common subsequence might consist of more than one element. Specifically, the program checks for common elements between the two sets and prints the first common element it finds. However, it does not ensure that the found element(s) form the shortest subsequence possible. 

Consider the following test case:
```
4 5
10 8 6 4
4 5 6 7 8
```

- The program will output `YES` and `1 4` because 4 is a common element.
- However, the common subsequence could be `[6, 4]` which is shorter.

To fix this, the program needs to identify all common elements and find the shortest subsequence among them. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        common_elements = set(lst1).intersection(lst2)
        
        if not common_elements:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Find the shortest subsequence
            min_len = float('inf')
            result = []
            for elem in common_elements:
                subseq = [x for x in lst1 if x == elem]
                if len(subseq) < min_len:
                    min_len = len(subseq)
                    result = subseq
            
            print('YES')
            print(min_len, *result[:min_len])
            
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the shortest subsequence is found among the common elements, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
