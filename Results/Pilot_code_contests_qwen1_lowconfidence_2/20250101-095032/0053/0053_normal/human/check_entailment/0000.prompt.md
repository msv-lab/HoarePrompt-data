You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two arrays of integers a_1,…,a_n and b_1,…,b_m.

Your task is to find a non-empty array c_1,…,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,…,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,…,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the lengths of the two arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1,…,b_m (1≤ b_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i≤ 1000).

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if a solution exists, or "NO" otherwise.

If the answer is "YES", on the next line output an integer k (1≤ k≤ 1000) — the length of the array, followed by k integers c_1,…,c_k (1≤ c_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions with the smallest possible k, output any.

Example

Input


5
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 1
3
3
1 1
3
2
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5


Output


YES
1 4
YES
1 3
NO
YES
1 3
YES
1 2

Note

In the first test case, [4] is a subsequence of [10, 8, 6, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This array has length 1, it is the smallest possible length of a subsequence of both a and b.

In the third test case, no non-empty subsequences of both [3] and [2] exist, so the answer is "NO".
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        nk = 0
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
