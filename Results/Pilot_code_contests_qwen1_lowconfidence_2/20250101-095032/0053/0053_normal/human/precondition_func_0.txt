t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of two lines of input: the first line contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, representing the lengths of the two arrays. The second and third lines of each test case contain n and m integers respectively, where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000. The sum of all n across all test cases and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).
