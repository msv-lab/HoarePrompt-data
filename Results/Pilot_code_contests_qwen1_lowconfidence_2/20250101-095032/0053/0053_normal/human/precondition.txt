t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. a_1, ..., a_n and b_1, ..., b_m are lists of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of n across all test cases and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).
