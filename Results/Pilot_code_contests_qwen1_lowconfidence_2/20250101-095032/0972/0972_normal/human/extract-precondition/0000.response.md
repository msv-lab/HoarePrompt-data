Precondition: **The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m. The next n lines contain the surnames (strings of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), region numbers (integers from 1 to m), and the number of points scored by the participants (integers from 0 to 800, inclusive). All surnames are distinct, and at least two people participated from each of the m regions. Surnames that only differ in letter cases are considered distinct.**
