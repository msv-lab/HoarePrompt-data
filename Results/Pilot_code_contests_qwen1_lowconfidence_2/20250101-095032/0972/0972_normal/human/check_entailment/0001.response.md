Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple teams in a region could be valid, but only one team is selected arbitrarily. According to the problem description, if there are multiple possible teams that satisfy the conditions, the program should output `?` for that region. However, the current implementation always selects the top two scorers without checking if there are multiple valid teams.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503
```

The program should output:
```
?
Andreev Semenov
```

But the current program outputs:
```
Ivanov Petrov
Andreev Semenov
```

This is because the program sorts the scores and selects the last two elements, which might not be the unique solution if there are multiple teams with the same highest score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
