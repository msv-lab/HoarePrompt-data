You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Very soon Berland will hold a School Team Programming Olympiad. From each of the m Berland regions a team of two people is invited to participate in the olympiad. The qualifying contest to form teams was held and it was attended by n Berland students. There were at least two schoolboys participating from each of the m regions of Berland. The result of each of the participants of the qualifying competition is an integer score from 0 to 800 inclusive.

The team of each region is formed from two such members of the qualifying competition of the region, that none of them can be replaced by a schoolboy of the same region, not included in the team and who received a greater number of points. There may be a situation where a team of some region can not be formed uniquely, that is, there is more than one school team that meets the properties described above. In this case, the region needs to undertake an additional contest. The two teams in the region are considered to be different if there is at least one schoolboy who is included in one team and is not included in the other team. It is guaranteed that for each region at least two its representatives participated in the qualifying contest.

Your task is, given the results of the qualifying competition, to identify the team from each region, or to announce that in this region its formation requires additional contests.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, n ≥ 2m) — the number of participants of the qualifying contest and the number of regions in Berland.

Next n lines contain the description of the participants of the qualifying contest in the following format: Surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), region number (integer from 1 to m) and the number of points scored by the participant (integer from 0 to 800, inclusive).

It is guaranteed that all surnames of all the participants are distinct and at least two people participated from each of the m regions. The surnames that only differ in letter cases, should be considered distinct.

Output

Print m lines. On the i-th line print the team of the i-th region — the surnames of the two team members in an arbitrary order, or a single character "?" (without the quotes) if you need to spend further qualifying contests in the region.

Examples

Input

5 2
Ivanov 1 763
Andreev 2 800
Petrov 1 595
Sidorov 1 790
Semenov 2 503


Output

Sidorov Ivanov
Andreev Semenov


Input

5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503


Output

?
Andreev Semenov

Note

In the first sample region teams are uniquely determined.

In the second sample the team from region 2 is uniquely determined and the team from region 1 can have three teams: "Petrov"-"Sidorov", "Ivanov"-"Sidorov", "Ivanov" -"Petrov", so it is impossible to determine a team uniquely.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m. The next n lines contain the surnames (strings of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), region numbers (integers from 1 to m), and the number of points scored by the participants (integers from 0 to 800, inclusive). All surnames are distinct, and at least two people participated from each of the m regions. Surnames that only differ in letter cases are considered distinct.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, m = rints()
    mem, ans = [[] for _ in range(m + 1)], []
    for _ in range(n):
        a = rstrs()
        
        mem[int(a[1])].append((int(a[-1]), a[0]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) sublists, each containing zero or more tuples of the form \((\text{integer}, \text{string})\), where each tuple corresponds to a value returned by the function `rstrs()` and the index of the sublist to which the tuple is appended is determined by the value of `int(a[1])` in the call to `rstrs()`; `ans` is an empty list; `_` is \(n\).
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        mem[i].sort()
        
        tem = mem[i]
        
        if len(tem) > 2 and tem[-3][0] in (tem[-1][0], tem[-2][0]):
            ans.append('?')
        else:
            ans.append('%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `m + 1`, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\), `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) sublists, each sublist is sorted, `ans` is a list of length `m + 1`, where each element is either `'?'` or a string in the format `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])`, depending on the conditions specified in the loop.
    print('\n'.join(ans))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data consisting of surnames, region numbers, and scores for participants. It organizes this data into a list of lists, where each sublist contains tuples of scores and surnames associated with a specific region. After sorting each sublist based on scores, the function checks if the third-highest score in any region is equal to the highest or second-highest score. If this condition is met, it appends '?' to the result list; otherwise, it appends the surnames of the highest and second-highest scoring participants. The function then prints the result list, which contains either '?' or formatted strings representing the surnames of the top two scorers in each region. The function handles the case where there are fewer than three participants in a region by defaulting to printing the top two available.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
