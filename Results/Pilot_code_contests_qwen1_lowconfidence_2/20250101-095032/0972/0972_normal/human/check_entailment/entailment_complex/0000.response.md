Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of participants `n` and the number of regions `m` from the input, ensuring these values meet the specified constraints.
   - It then reads the surnames, region numbers, and scores of each participant and stores them in a nested list `mem`, where `mem[i]` contains the tuples `(score, surname)` for the `i-th` region.

2. **Sorting and Team Formation Logic:**
   - For each region, the program sorts the list of tuples in descending order of scores.
   - It then checks if the third-highest score is equal to the highest or second-highest score. If this condition is true, it means there are multiple valid teams, and the program appends `'?'` to the answer list `ans`.
   - Otherwise, it appends the surnames of the highest and second-highest scoring participants to `ans`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - Finally, the program prints the list `ans`, which contains either `'?'` for regions requiring further contests or the surnames of the selected team members.

4. **Compliance with Problem Description:**
   - The program correctly identifies if a unique team can be formed for each region or if further contests are needed.
   - It handles the sorting and comparison of scores accurately, ensuring that the conditions specified in the problem statement are checked.
   - The output format matches the expected format, providing either the surnames of the team members or `'?'` for regions needing further contests.

Since the program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the necessary conditions and outputs correctly, the program is correct.
