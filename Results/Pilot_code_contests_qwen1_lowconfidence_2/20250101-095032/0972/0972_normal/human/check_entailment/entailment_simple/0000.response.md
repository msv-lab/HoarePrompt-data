Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not correctly determine the team from each region as required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to identify the team members does not fully meet the requirements.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Sorting Logic**: 
   - The program sorts the participants in each region based on their scores (`mem[i].sort()`). However, the problem description requires that the team members are chosen such that no member can be replaced by a participant from the same region who scored higher.
   - Sorting by score alone does not guarantee that the highest-scoring participants are the ones who cannot be replaced by anyone else in their region. For example, consider the following scenario:
     - Region 1: Sidorov (800), Ivanov (790), Petrov (763)
     - The program would sort these as Sidorov (800), Ivanov (790), Petrov (763) and choose Sidorov and Ivanov. But actually, Ivanov can be replaced by Sidorov (since Sidorov has the highest score and no one else from the region can replace him).
   
2. **Replacement Check**:
   - The program checks if the third-highest scoring participant has the same score as the top two participants to decide whether to append `'?'`. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the top two participants are irreplaceable.
   - The correct approach would involve checking that no participant in the region has a higher score than both of the chosen team members.

3. **Team Selection**:
   - The program selects the top two participants from the sorted list without ensuring they are irreplaceable. It should find the highest-scoring participant and check if any other participant from the same region has a higher score. If not, the first participant is irreplaceable. Then, it should find the next highest participant who is also irreplaceable.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 790
Semenov 2 503
```

- The program would output:
  ```
  Sidorov Ivanov
  Andreev Semenov
  ```

- However, the correct output should be:
  ```
  ?
  Andreev Semenov
  ```

Because Sidorov and Ivanov are both from Region 1 and Sidorov is the highest scorer, he cannot be replaced. But Ivanov can be replaced by Sidorov (since both have the same score and Sidorov is irreplaceable), making the team selection ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify the irreplaceable team members and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
