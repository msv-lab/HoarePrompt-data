The code `a = rstrs()` assigns the value returned by the function `rstrs()` to the variable `a`. Since the exact nature and return value of the function `rstrs()` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. However, we know that the function returns a value.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])`; `ans` remains an empty list; `_` remains `_prev + 1` where `_prev` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and satisfies `_prev < n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])`; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`; `_` is `_prev + 1` where `_prev` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and satisfies `_prev < n - 1`**
