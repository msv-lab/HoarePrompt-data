Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) sublists, each containing zero or more tuples of the form \((\text{integer}, \text{string})\), where each tuple corresponds to a value returned by the function `rstrs()` and the index of the sublist to which the tuple is appended is determined by the value of `int(a[1])` in the call to `rstrs()`; `ans` is an empty list; `_` is \(n\).**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- Each time the loop runs, it appends a tuple \((\text{integer}, \text{string})\) to the sublist in `mem` at the index determined by `int(a[1])`, where `a` is the return value of the function `rstrs()`.
- After all iterations, `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop. Similarly, `m` and `ans` also remain unchanged as they are not modified.
- The list `mem` accumulates tuples based on the values of `a[1]` and `a[-1]` from the function calls to `rstrs()`. Each tuple \((\text{integer}, \text{string})\) is added to the appropriate sublist in `mem`.
