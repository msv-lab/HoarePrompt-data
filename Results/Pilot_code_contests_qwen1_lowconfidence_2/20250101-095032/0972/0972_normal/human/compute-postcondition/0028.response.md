According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `i` is 2,
- `tem` is `mem[2]`,
- `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\),
- `ans` is `['?', '?']` based on the conditions given.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

The value of `tem` remains `mem[2]`, as the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `tem`.

The value of `m` remains unchanged since it is an external variable that defines the range of the loop and is not modified within the loop itself.

The value of `ans` remains `['?', '?']` because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `ans`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `tem` is `mem[2]`, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\), `ans` is `['?', '?']`**
