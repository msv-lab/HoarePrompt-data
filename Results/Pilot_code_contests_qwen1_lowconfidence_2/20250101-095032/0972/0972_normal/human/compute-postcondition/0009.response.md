The code appends a tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` to the sublist in `mem` at the index `int(a[1])`. The values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `mem`, and `ans` are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\).
- `m` is the second integer read from the input, satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\).
- `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`.
- `_` is `_prev + 1` where `_prev` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and satisfies `_prev < n - 1`.

After executing the line `mem[int(a[1])].append((int(a[-1]), a[0]))`:
- The tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` is appended to the sublist in `mem` at the index `int(a[1])`.
- The value of `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input, satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])` and another tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the same sublist; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`; `_` is `_prev + 1` where `_prev` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and satisfies `_prev < n - 1`.**
