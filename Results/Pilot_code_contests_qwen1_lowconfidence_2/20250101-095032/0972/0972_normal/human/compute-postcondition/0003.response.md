The code initializes two lists: `mem` and `ans`. 

- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, meaning `mem[0]` to `mem[m]` are all empty lists.
- `ans` is an empty list.

The initial values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the next `n` lines containing the surnames, region numbers, and points scored by the participants are yet to be read.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 000 and `n` ≥ 2`m`; `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10 000; `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists; `ans` is an empty list.**
