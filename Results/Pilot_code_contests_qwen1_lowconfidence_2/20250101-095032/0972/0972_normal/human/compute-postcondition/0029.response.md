`mem[i]` is sorted, where `i` is 3, so `mem[3]` is sorted. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3; `tem` is `mem[2]`; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `ans` is `['?', '?']`; `mem[3]` is sorted.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `tem` is `mem[2]`; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `ans` is `['?', '?']`; `mem[3]` is sorted**
