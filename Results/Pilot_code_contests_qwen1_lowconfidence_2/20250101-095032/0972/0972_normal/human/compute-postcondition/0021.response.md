Postcondition: **`i` is 1; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `tem` is the first element of the list `mem[1]`; if the length of `tem` is greater than 2 and the third last element of `tem` has the same first element as either the last or second last element of `tem`, `ans` is a list containing one element `'?'`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])**
