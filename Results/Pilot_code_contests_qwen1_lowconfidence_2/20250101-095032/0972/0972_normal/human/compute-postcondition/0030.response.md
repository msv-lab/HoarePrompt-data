The code assigns the value of `mem[i]` to `tem`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `tem` is now assigned the value of `mem[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `tem` is `mem[3]`; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `ans` is `['?', '?']`; `mem[3]` is sorted**
