`ans.append('?')` adds the string `'?'` to the list `ans`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, and `tem`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\), `tem` is the first element of the list `mem[1]`, the length of `tem` is greater than 2, the third last element of `tem` has the same first element as either the last or second last element of `tem`, and `ans` is a list containing one element `'?'`.**
