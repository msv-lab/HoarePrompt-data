The code appends the formatted string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies `ans` by adding a new element. The other variables (`i`, `tem`, `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Since `tem` is a list and `ans` is supposed to contain `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` if certain conditions are met, and it is added here, we know that `ans` now contains this string.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2; `tem` is `mem[2]`; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `ans` is a list containing the element `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])`; `mem[2]` is sorted.**
