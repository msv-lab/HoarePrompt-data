Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input, satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\).
   - `m` is the second integer read from the input, satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\).
   - `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])` and another tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the same sublist.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`.
   - `_` is `_prev + 1` where `_prev` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and satisfies `_prev < n - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `range(n)`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `_prev` was `_ - 1` (since `_` is incremented at the start of each iteration).
   - `_prev` satisfies `_prev < n - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `_` must be less than `n`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `_prev + 1` and `_prev` was `_ - 1` from the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `_` at the start of the next iteration will be `(_ - 1) + 1 = _`.

5. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `_` must satisfy `_ < n`.

Given the conditions:
- `_` at the end of the previous iteration is `_ - 1`.
- `_` at the start of the next iteration will be `_`.

Since `_prev` was `_ - 1` and it satisfied `_prev < n - 1`, `_` will now be `_` and must satisfy `_ < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `_` is `_ + 1` and satisfies `_ < n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input, satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])` and another tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the same sublist; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`; `_` is `_ + 1` and satisfies `_ < n - 1`**.
