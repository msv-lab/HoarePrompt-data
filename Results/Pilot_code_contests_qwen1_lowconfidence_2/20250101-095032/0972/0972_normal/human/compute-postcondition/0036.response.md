The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the function definition. Instead, it seems to operate on data that is presumably passed to it through some external means (e.g., a file, another function call, etc.). The function processes data consisting of surnames, region numbers, and scores for participants. The constraints and relationships among the input data are as follows:

- There are `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) lines of input, each containing a surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), a region number (an integer from 1 to m), and the number of points scored by the participants (an integer from 0 to 800, inclusive).
- There are `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000 and n ≥ 2m) regions.
- Each region has at least two participants.
- Surnames are distinct, but those that only differ in letter cases are considered distinct.

Given these constraints, the function's behavior can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes data consisting of surnames, region numbers, and scores for participants, where the total number of participants is `n` (with 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) and the number of regions is `m` (with 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000 and n ≥ 2m). The function does not explicitly accept parameters but operates on the provided data to produce a result.**
