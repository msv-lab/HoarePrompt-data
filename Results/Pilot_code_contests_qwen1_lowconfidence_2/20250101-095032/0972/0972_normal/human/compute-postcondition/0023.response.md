The code snippet `mem[i].sort()` sorts the list `mem[i]`. Since `i` is initially 2, this means the list `mem[2]` is sorted. The other variables (`m`, `tem`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\), `tem` is the first element of the list `mem[1]`, `ans` contains the string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` if the length of `tem` is greater than 2 and the third last element of `tem` has the same first element as either the last or second last element of `tem`, otherwise `ans` contains a list containing one element `'?'`, `mem[2]` is sorted.**
