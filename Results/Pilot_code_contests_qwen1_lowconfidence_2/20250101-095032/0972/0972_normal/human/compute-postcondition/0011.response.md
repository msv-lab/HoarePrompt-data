The code snippet assigns the value returned by the function `rstrs()` to the variable `a`. The function `rstrs()` is not defined in the given context, so its exact behavior is unknown. However, since the function returns a value, let's denote the returned value as `returned_value`. This value will be assigned to `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\)
- `m` is the second integer read from the input, satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\)
- `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])` and another tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the same sublist
- `ans` is an empty list
- `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`
- `_` is `_ + 1` and satisfies `_ < n - 1`

After executing `a = rstrs()`, the variable `a` will hold the returned value from the function `rstrs()`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input, satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])` and another tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the same sublist; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the returned value from the function `rstrs()`; `_` is `_ + 1` and satisfies `_ < n - 1`**
