Let's break down the task step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\).
- `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\).
- `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) sublists, each containing zero or more tuples of the form \((\text{integer}, \text{string})\), where each tuple corresponds to a value returned by the function `rstrs()` and the index of the sublist to which the tuple is appended is determined by the value of `int(a[1])` in the call to `rstrs()`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `_` is \(n\).

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1 and should increment until it reaches `m + 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - According to the `range` function, the loop starts with `i = 1`.

3. **Value of `m`**:
   - `m` is a variable that was read from the input and its value is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`, `mem`, and `ans` are already defined but they do not affect the loop's execution directly (they might influence the loop body but not the loop condition).

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `i` starts at 1 and `m` is a valid integer within its specified range.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\)**
