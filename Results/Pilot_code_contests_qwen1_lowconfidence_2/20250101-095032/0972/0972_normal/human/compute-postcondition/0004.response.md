To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the `for` loop statement and their initial states.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100, 000\) and \(n \geq 2m\).
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, but since it is constrained by \(2 \leq n \leq 100, 000\) and \(n \geq 2m\), we know that `n` will always satisfy these conditions if valid input is given. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10, 000\).
   - Similarly, for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, which is guaranteed by its constraint \(1 \leq m \leq 10, 000\). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `m`.

3. **Variable `_`:**
   - The loop uses `_` as a placeholder variable and iterates `n` times.
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is already constrained to be at least 2 (from \(n \geq 2m\)), the loop will always execute `n` times.

4. **List `mem`:**
   - `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists.
   - This list definition does not affect the loop's ability to execute directly. However, we should ensure that `m + 1` is a valid number and that the list is properly initialized.

5. **List `ans`:**
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - Similar to `mem`, the initialization of `ans` as an empty list does not affect the loopâ€™s execution directly.

### Conclusion:

Since all constraints are met and the loop will always execute as long as `n` is a positive integer, we don't need to adjust any additional states beyond ensuring that `n` and `m` are within their specified ranges.

### Final State:

State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100, 000\) and \(n \geq 2m\), `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10, 000\), `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists, `ans` is an empty list.**

This ensures that the loop can execute based on the given constraints.
