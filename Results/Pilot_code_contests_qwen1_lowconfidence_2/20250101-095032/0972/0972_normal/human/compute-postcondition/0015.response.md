The code `mem[i].sort()` sorts the list at `mem[i]`. However, the initial state does not specify what `mem` is or what list `mem[i]` contains. Since `i` is 1, `mem[1]` is the list that gets sorted. But without knowing the contents of `mem[1]`, we cannot provide a specific output for the sorted list. 

Given the initial state, the only changes are to the list at `mem[1]`, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem[1]` is a sorted list (but the specific elements are unknown)**
