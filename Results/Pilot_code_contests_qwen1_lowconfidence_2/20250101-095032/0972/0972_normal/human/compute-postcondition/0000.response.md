The given code snippet defines a lambda function `rints` which reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list of integers. This function does not directly modify any existing variables but rather defines a new function that can be used later to read input.

Given this, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state because no variables are directly modified within the provided code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m. The next n lines contain the surnames (strings of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), region numbers (integers from 1 to m), and the number of points scored by the participants (integers from 0 to 800, inclusive). All surnames are distinct, and at least two people participated from each of the m regions. Surnames that only differ in letter cases are considered distinct; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.**
