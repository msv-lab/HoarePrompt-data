`ans` originally contains the string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` if the length of `tem` is greater than 2 and the third last element of `tem` has the same first element as either the last or second last element of `tem`, otherwise `ans` contains a list containing one element `'?'`. The code `ans.append('?')` adds the string `'?'` to the list `ans`.

Since `ans` was initially a list (either containing the string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` or a single string `'?'`), appending `'?'` to it means `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are strings.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `tem` is `mem[2]`, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\), `ans` is `['?', '?']`, `mem[2]` is sorted.**
