The code `n, m = rints()` assigns the values read from the input using the `rints()` function to the variables `n` and `m`. Since `rints()` is not defined in the given context, we assume it reads two integers separated by whitespace. Given the precondition, `n` and `m` will hold the values of the two integers read from the input, and the conditions on these values are respected.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 000 and `n` ≥ 2`m`; `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10 000; the next `n` lines contain the surnames, region numbers, and points scored by the participants.**
