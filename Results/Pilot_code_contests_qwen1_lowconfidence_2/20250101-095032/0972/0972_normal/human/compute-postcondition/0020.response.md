`ans.append('%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]))` appends a string to the list `ans` using the values from the third last and second last elements of `tem`. According to the precondition, `tem` has a length less than or equal to 2 or the third last element of `tem` is not in the set containing the last and second last elements of `tem`. This means that the third last element of `tem` cannot exist, so the code will only access the last two elements of `tem`.

Let's denote the last element of `tem` as `(last_element_1, last_value_1)` and the second last element as `(second_last_element, second_value)`. The code will append the string `'%s %s' % (last_value_1, second_value)` to `ans`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `tem` is the first element of the list `mem[1]`; the length of `tem` is less than or equal to 2 or the third last element of `tem` is not in the set containing the last and second last elements of `tem`; `ans` contains the string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `tem` is the first element of the list `mem[1]`; the length of `tem` is less than or equal to 2 or the third last element of `tem` is not in the set containing the last and second last elements of `tem`; `ans` contains the string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])**.
