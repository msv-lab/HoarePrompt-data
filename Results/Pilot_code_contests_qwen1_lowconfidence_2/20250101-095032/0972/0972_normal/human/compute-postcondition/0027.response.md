Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `tem` is `mem[2]`, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\), `ans` is `['?', '?']` if the length of `tem` is not greater than 2 or the third last element of `tem` does not have the same first element as either the last or second last element of `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` is `['?', '?']` if the third last element matches the condition. `mem[2]` is sorted.***
