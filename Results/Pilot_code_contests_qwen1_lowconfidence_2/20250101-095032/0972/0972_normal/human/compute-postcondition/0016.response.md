The code assigns the value of `mem[i]` to the variable `tem`. The value of `i` is 1, so `tem` is assigned the first element of the list `mem[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `tem` is the first element of the list `mem[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `tem` is the first element of the list `mem[1]`**
