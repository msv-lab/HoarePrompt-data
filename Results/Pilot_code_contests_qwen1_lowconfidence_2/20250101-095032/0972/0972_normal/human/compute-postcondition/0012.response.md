The code snippet `mem[int(a[1])].append((int(a[-1]), a[0]))` appends a tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` to the sublist in `mem` at the index specified by `int(a[1])`. 

- Before the execution, `mem` is a list of \(m+1\) empty lists, with an additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])`.
- `a` is the returned value from the function `rstrs()`, but its exact value is not provided.
- `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `_` retain their initial values.

After executing the line of code, the sublist in `mem` at the index `int(a[1])` will contain an additional tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input, satisfying \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])` and another tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to the same sublist; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the returned value from the function `rstrs()`; `_` is `_ + 1` and satisfies `_ < n - 1`**.
