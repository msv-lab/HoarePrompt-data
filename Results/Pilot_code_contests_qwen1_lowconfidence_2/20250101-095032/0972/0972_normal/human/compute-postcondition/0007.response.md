According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` (which is an underscore, typically used as a throwaway variable) is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:

- `n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\).
- `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\).
- `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `_ < n` must still hold true. This means that after incrementing `_` by 1, it should still be less than `n`.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Let's denote the current value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration as `_prev`.
2. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `_` at the start of the next iteration will be `_prev + 1`.
3. For the loop to continue, `_prev + 1` must be less than `n`.
4. Therefore, `_prev` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given these conditions, we can update the states accordingly:

- The value of `_` will be `_prev + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `mem`, `ans`, and `a`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body (as per the problem statement).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])`; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`; `_` is `_prev + 1` where `_prev` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and satisfies `_prev < n - 1`**.
