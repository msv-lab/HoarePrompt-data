The code `a = rstrs()` assigns the value returned by the function `rstrs()` to the variable `a`. However, the function `rstrs()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so its exact behavior and the value it returns cannot be determined. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `mem`, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`**
