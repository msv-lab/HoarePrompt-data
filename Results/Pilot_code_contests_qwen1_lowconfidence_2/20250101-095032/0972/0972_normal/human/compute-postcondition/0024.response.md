The code `tem = mem[i]` assigns the value of `mem[i]` to `tem`. Given that `i` is 2, `tem` now holds the value of `mem[2]`. The other variables (`m`, `ans`, `mem[2]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `tem` is `mem[2]`, `m` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\), `ans` contains the string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` if the length of `tem` is greater than 2 and the third last element of `tem` has the same first element as either the last or second last element of `tem`, otherwise `ans` contains a list containing one element `'?'`, `mem[2]` is sorted.**
