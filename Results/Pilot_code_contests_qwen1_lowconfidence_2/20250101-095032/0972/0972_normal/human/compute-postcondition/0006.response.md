The code `mem[int(a[1])].append((int(a[-1]), a[0]))` impacts the following:

- `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists.
- `a` is a list returned by the function `rstrs()`.
- `mem[int(a[1])]` accesses the sublist in `mem` at the index given by `a[1]`.
- `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` creates a tuple with the last element of `a` converted to an integer and the first element of `a`.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`, and no specific value for `a` is provided, the impact on the variables is:

- `mem[int(a[1])]` appends a tuple to the sublist at the index specified by `a[1]`. The tuple consists of the integer value of the last element of `a` and the string value of the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and satisfies \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and \(n \geq 2m\); `m` is the second integer read from the input and satisfies \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\); `mem` is a list of \(m + 1\) empty lists with one additional tuple appended to the sublist at index `int(a[1])`; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the value returned by the function `rstrs()`**
