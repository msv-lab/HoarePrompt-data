Functionality: **The function processes input data consisting of surnames, region numbers, and scores for participants. It organizes this data into a list of lists, where each sublist contains tuples of scores and surnames associated with a specific region. After sorting each sublist based on scores, the function checks if the third-highest score in any region is equal to the highest or second-highest score. If this condition is met, it appends '?' to the result list; otherwise, it appends the surnames of the highest and second-highest scoring participants. The function then prints the result list, which contains either '?' or formatted strings representing the surnames of the top two scorers in each region. The function handles the case where there are fewer than three participants in a region by defaulting to printing the top two available.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If a region has fewer than two participants, the function will still attempt to print the top two scores, but this could lead to undefined behavior since there won't be enough elements to compare.
- If the input data is invalid (e.g., non-integer values for scores or regions), the function relies on the input being correctly formatted, and it will proceed with the available data.
