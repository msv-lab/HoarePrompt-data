Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires determining if there exists a set of choices to put balls in the boxes such that for every integer \(i\) between 1 and \(N\), the total number of balls in the boxes with multiples of \(i\) written on them is congruent to \(a_i\) modulo 2. 

The given functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are utility functions and do not contribute to solving the main problem. There is no implementation of the actual logic to check for a valid set of choices or to output such a set if it exists.

To demonstrate that the program does not work as expected, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 0
```

A correct solution would output:
```
1
1
```

However, the provided program does not handle this input or any other input related to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is thus incorrect.
