Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are utility functions and do not address the core problem of determining if a set of choices exists that satisfies the given conditions. The function `func_3` reads the input and splits it into integers, but it does not perform any checks or calculations related to the problem description. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct based on the given problem description and the expected functionality.
