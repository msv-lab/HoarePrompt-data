Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement any logic to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are placeholders and do not contribute to solving the problem. The program reads input but does not process it according to the problem description. Specifically, it does not check the conditions for a good set of choices or output a valid solution if one exists. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case and is incorrect.
