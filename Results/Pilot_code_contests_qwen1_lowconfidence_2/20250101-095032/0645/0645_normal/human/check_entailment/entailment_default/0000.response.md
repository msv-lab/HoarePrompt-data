Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem description. Specifically, the code appears to be designed to find the indices of boxes that should contain a ball to satisfy the given conditions, but it does not handle the case where no valid configuration exists.

The problem requires finding a set of choices such that for every integer \(i\) between 1 and \(N\), the total number of balls in the boxes with multiples of \(i\) written on them is congruent to \(a_i\) modulo 2. The provided code does not check if a valid configuration exists and does not handle the case where no such configuration can be found.

Hereâ€™s a counterexample to illustrate why the code is incorrect:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
The code would attempt to find a valid configuration, but it does not handle the case where no valid configuration exists. Instead, it would print a non-empty list of indices, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Code:
- The code reads the number of boxes \(N\) and the array \(A\) from the input.
- It then iterates backward through the array \(A\) to determine which boxes should contain a ball.
- If the sum of the balls in the multiples of the current index does not match \(A[i]\) modulo 2, it sets the current box to contain a ball.
- Finally, it prints the number of boxes that contain a ball and the indices of those boxes.

However, the code does not check if a valid configuration is possible, and it always tries to produce a configuration, even if one does not exist. This leads to incorrect output for cases where no valid configuration exists.

Therefore, the code is incorrect, and the answer is **False**.
