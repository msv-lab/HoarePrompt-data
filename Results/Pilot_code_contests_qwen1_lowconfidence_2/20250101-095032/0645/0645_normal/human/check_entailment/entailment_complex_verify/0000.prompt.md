You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Examples

Input

3
1 0 0


Output

1

Input

5
0 0 0 0 0


Output

Program:
```
from collections import *
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(inp())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires determining if there exists a set of choices to put balls in the boxes such that for every integer \(i\) between 1 and \(N\), the total number of balls in the boxes with multiples of \(i\) written on them is congruent to \(a_i\) modulo 2. 

The given functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are utility functions and do not contribute to solving the main problem. There is no implementation of the actual logic to check for a valid set of choices or to output such a set if it exists.

To demonstrate that the program does not work as expected, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 0
```

A correct solution would output:
```
1
1
```

However, the provided program does not handle this input or any other input related to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is thus incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import *
import sys

inp = raw_input
N = func_2()
A = func_3()
out = [0] * N
fail = False
B = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = 0
    for k in range(i, N, j):
        S += out[k]
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)
print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer or a sequence of characters that can be converted into an integer.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and attempts to convert it to an integer. If the conversion is successful, it returns the integer value. If the conversion fails, it writes an error message to the standard error stream and returns the error message. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the standard error stream for output. Potential edge cases include strings that are not valid representations of integers (e.g., "abc", "123a"), which will result in an error message being written to the standard error stream.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inp() is a function that reads an integer from standard input.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input using the inp() function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads an integer from standard input using the `inp()` function. It then returns the integer read from the input. There are no edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code; the function simply reads an integer and returns it.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of N integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of N integers, each either 0 or 1, obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. Each integer in the returned list is either 0 or 1. The function assumes that the input consists of exactly N space-separated integers, where N is specified by the length of the input line. There are no explicit error checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or mismatched number of elements), which means that if the input format is incorrect, the function may raise a `ValueError`. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string might contain trailing whitespace or other non-numeric characters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
