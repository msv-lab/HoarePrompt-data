Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment was marked as **False**, suggesting that the program did not implement the logic required to solve the problem. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the program does indeed attempt to solve the problem as described.

Let's break down the annotated version step-by-step:

1. **Reading Inputs**: 
   - `N = func_2()` reads an integer \(N\).
   - `A = func_3()` reads a list of \(N\) integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.

2. **Initializing Variables**:
   - `out = [0] * N`: Initializes a list `out` of length \(N\) with all elements set to 0. This list represents whether a ball is placed in each box (1 for a ball, 0 for no ball).
   - `fail = False`: A boolean flag indicating if a solution has failed to be found yet.

3. **Backward Filling**:
   - The program iterates backward through the list `out` starting from index \(N-1\) to 0.
   - For each index \(i\), it calculates the sum `S` of the elements in `out` at indices that are multiples of \(i+1\).
   - If `S % 2 != A[i]`, it sets `out[i]` to 1 and appends \(j\) (which is \(i+1\)) to the list `B`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `B` is not empty, it prints the length of `B` followed by the elements of `B`.
   - If `B` is empty, it prints `-1`.

This approach ensures that the conditions specified in the problem are met. Specifically, for each integer \(i\) between 1 and \(N\), the total number of balls in the boxes with multiples of \(i\) written on them is congruent to \(A[i]\) modulo 2.

Given the annotations and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic to find a valid set of choices or determine that no such set exists. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to **True**.
