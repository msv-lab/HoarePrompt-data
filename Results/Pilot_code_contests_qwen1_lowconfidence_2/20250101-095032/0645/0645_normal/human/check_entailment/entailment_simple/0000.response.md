Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads `N` (the number of boxes) and the list `A` (containing binary values indicating the required parity conditions).
   - It uses `func_2()` and `func_3()` to read and process the input as specified.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program iterates backward through the list `A` and calculates the necessary state for each position based on the constraints.
   - For each box `i`, it checks if the sum of balls in all boxes with indices that are multiples of `i` should match the value `A[i]`.
   - If the current state does not satisfy this condition, it sets the box `i` to have a ball (`out[i] = 1`) and records the necessary adjustments.

3. **Constructing the Solution:**
   - The program keeps track of which boxes need to have balls added (`B` list) to satisfy the conditions.
   - After determining the solution, it prints the number of boxes with balls and the indices of those boxes.

4. **Handling No Solution Case:**
   - If no valid configuration is found (which would indicate a contradiction in the problem constraints), the program prints `-1`. However, the problem statement does not explicitly require handling contradictions, so this part is not strictly necessary for correctness.

Given the assumptions about valid input and the nature of the problem, the provided code accurately implements the required logic to determine if a valid configuration exists and to output such a configuration if possible. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
