You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Examples

Annotated Functions:
from collections import *
import sys

inp = raw_input
N = func_2()
A = func_3()
out = [0] * N
fail = False
B = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = 0
    for k in range(i, N, j):
        S += out[k]
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)
print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer or a sequence of characters that can be converted into an integer.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and attempts to convert it to an integer. If the conversion is successful, it returns the integer value. If the conversion fails, it writes an error message to the standard error stream and returns the error message. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the standard error stream for output. Potential edge cases include strings that are not valid representations of integers (e.g., "abc", "123a"), which will result in an error message being written to the standard error stream.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inp() is a function that reads an integer from standard input.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input using the inp() function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads an integer from standard input using the `inp()` function. It then returns the integer read from the input. There are no edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code; the function simply reads an integer and returns it.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of N integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of N integers, each either 0 or 1, obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. Each integer in the returned list is either 0 or 1. The function assumes that the input consists of exactly N space-separated integers, where N is specified by the length of the input line. There are no explicit error checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or mismatched number of elements), which means that if the input format is incorrect, the function may raise a `ValueError`. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string might contain trailing whitespace or other non-numeric characters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
