Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of how the code aligns with the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads an integer `N` from standard input.
   - The function `func_3()` reads a list of `N` integers (`a_i`), each being either 0 or 1, from standard input.
   - These functions match the problem description, where `N` is the number of boxes and `a_i` specifies whether the total number of balls in the multiples of box `i` should be even or odd.

2. **Constructing the Solution:**
   - The code iterates backward through the boxes, starting from the last box.
   - For each box `i`, it calculates the sum of the values in boxes that are multiples of `i`.
   - If the sum modulo 2 does not match `a_i`, it sets the current box `i` to contain a ball (`out[i] = 1`) and records the box in `B`.
   - This approach ensures that the condition for each `a_i` is met by adjusting the minimum number of boxes needed.

3. **Output:**
   - The code prints the number of boxes that contain a ball followed by their indices.
   - If no solution exists, it prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `N` is 1, which would directly return 0 and an empty list.
   - The code handles the case where all `a_i` are 0, meaning no balls are needed, and prints 0 and an empty list.
   - The code handles the case where all `a_i` are 1, ensuring that all boxes are checked and adjusted accordingly.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations in the code correctly summarize the logic and state transitions.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` accurately reflect their intended purposes and do not introduce any additional complexity or errors.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the implementation appears to be correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct, and the output is `Correctness: True`.
