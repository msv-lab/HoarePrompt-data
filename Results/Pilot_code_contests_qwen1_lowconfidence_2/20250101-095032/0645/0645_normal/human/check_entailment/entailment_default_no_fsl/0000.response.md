Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not account for the possibility that the input list `A` might contain more than \(2 \times 10^5\) elements, which is beyond the specified constraint \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\). However, the current implementation does not check the length of the input list `A`, and thus it may fail for inputs where \(N > 2 \times 10^5\).

To address this, the code should include a check at the beginning to ensure that \(N \leq 2 \times 10^5\). If this check fails, the program should return `-1` immediately. This ensures that the program adheres to the problem constraints for all potential cases.
