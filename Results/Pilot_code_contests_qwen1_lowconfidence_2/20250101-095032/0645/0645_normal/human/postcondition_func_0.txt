The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and attempts to convert it to an integer. If the conversion is successful, it returns the integer value. If the conversion fails, it writes an error message to the standard error stream and returns the error message. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the standard error stream for output. Potential edge cases include strings that are not valid representations of integers (e.g., "abc", "123a"), which will result in an error message being written to the standard error stream.
