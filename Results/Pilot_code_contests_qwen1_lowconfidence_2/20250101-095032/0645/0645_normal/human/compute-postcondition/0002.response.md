Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. Each integer in the returned list is either 0 or 1. The function assumes that the input consists of exactly N space-separated integers, where N is specified by the length of the input line. There are no explicit error checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or mismatched number of elements), which means that if the input format is incorrect, the function may raise a `ValueError`. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string might contain trailing whitespace or other non-numeric characters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
