#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer or a sequence of characters that can be converted into an integer.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and attempts to convert it to an integer. If the conversion is successful, it returns the integer value. If the conversion fails, it writes an error message to the standard error stream and returns the error message. The function does not modify any external variables and only uses the standard error stream for output. Potential edge cases include strings that are not valid representations of integers (e.g., "abc", "123a"), which will result in an error message being written to the standard error stream.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: inp() is a function that reads an integer from standard input.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input using the inp() function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads an integer from standard input using the `inp()` function. It then returns the integer read from the input. There are no edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code; the function simply reads an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of N integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of N integers, each either 0 or 1, obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. Each integer in the returned list is either 0 or 1. The function assumes that the input consists of exactly N space-separated integers, where N is specified by the length of the input line. There are no explicit error checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or mismatched number of elements), which means that if the input format is incorrect, the function may raise a `ValueError`. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string might contain trailing whitespace or other non-numeric characters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
