The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ans1`, `valid1` is `False`, the current value of `ans1[i]` is equal to the previous value of `ans1[i-1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
