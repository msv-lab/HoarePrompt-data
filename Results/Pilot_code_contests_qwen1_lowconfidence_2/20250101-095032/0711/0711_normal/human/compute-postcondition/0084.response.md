Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user with at least 3 characters, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `ans2` is a list created from the string `s`, `rec1` is the number of valid replacements made, initially set to 0, `rec2` is 0, and `neigh` is a tuple. The condition `i < n - 1` is satisfied, and if `i > 0`, `neigh` is updated to contain the character at index `i-1` of the string `s`.***
