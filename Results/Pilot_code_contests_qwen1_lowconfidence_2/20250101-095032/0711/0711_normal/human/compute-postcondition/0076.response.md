The code `rec1 += 1` increments the value of `rec1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `rec1` is the original value plus 1.

Output State: **`i` is \(i + 2\), `neigh` is either `()` or `(\text{s}[i + 1],)`, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `chosen` is the first element in `alpha` that is not in `neigh` (if any); otherwise, it is `None`, `ans1[i + 2]` is now `chosen`, `rec1` is increased by 1**
