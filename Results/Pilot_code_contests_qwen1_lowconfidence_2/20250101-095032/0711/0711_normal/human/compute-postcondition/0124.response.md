Output State: **`i` is either `i_0 + 3` or `i_0 + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2` or the loop did not execute, `neigh` is either an empty tuple or contains valid neighbors based on the sequence `s`, `chosen` is set to `c` if `c` is not in `neigh` and the loop breaks, otherwise `chosen` remains undefined, `alpha` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character `c` in `alpha`.
- If `c` is not found in `neigh`, the loop breaks and sets `chosen` to `c`.
- The loop only executes as long as there are characters in `alpha` that are not in `neigh`.

Given the provided output states, we observe:
1. After each iteration, `i` increments by 1, starting from `i_0 + 2`.
2. The loop continues until a character `c` is found in `neigh` or all characters in `alpha` have been checked.
3. If `c` is not in `neigh`, `chosen` is set to `c` and the loop breaks.
4. If the loop does not execute at all, `i` remains `i_0 + 2`, and `chosen` remains undefined.

Thus, the final state depends on whether the loop executed and which character `c` was found. If the loop did not execute, `i` would still be `i_0 + 2` and `chosen` would remain undefined. If the loop did execute, `i` would be incremented to `i_0 + 3` and `chosen` would be set to the first character `c` not in `neigh`.

Hence, the final output state captures these conditions.
