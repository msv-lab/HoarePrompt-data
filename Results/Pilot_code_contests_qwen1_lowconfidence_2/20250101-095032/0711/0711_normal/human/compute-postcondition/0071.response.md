The code assigns the value of `c` to `chosen`. This means that the value of `chosen` is updated to be the same as `c`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is either `()` or `(s[i + 1],)`, `alpha` must contain at least one unvisited element, `chosen` is `c`, `ans1[i + 2]` is undefined, `rec1` is increased by 1, and `c` is the first unvisited element in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`**
