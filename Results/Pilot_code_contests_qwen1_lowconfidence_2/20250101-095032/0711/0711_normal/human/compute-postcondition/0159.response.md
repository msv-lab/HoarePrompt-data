`valid1` is assigned the value `False`, which does not change its previous value. The value of `i` was incremented by 1, and the value of `ans1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ans1` and is now `i+1`, `valid1` is `False`.

Output State: **`ans1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ans1` and is now `i+1`, `valid1` is `False`.**
