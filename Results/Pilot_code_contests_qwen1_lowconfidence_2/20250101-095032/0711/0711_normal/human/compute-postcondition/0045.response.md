The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables remain in their initial states. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `alpha` contains at least one element, `c` is the next element from `alpha`, `neigh` remains unchanged, `chosen` is the next element from `alpha`**
