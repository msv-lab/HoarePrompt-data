`chosen` is reassigned to the current value of `c`. Since `c` is the next unvisited element in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, this assignment does not change the nature of `c` or `chosen`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is either `()` or `(s[i + 1],)`, `alpha` must contain at least one unvisited element, `chosen` is the next unvisited element in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, `ans1[i + 2]` is equal to `chosen`, `rec1` is increased by 1, and the current value of `c` is the next unvisited element in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`.**
