The code `break` does not affect any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the execution of `break` here would simply indicate breaking out of a non-existent loop or switch. However, since the initial state does not indicate any loop or switch, the variables `chosen`, `neigh`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chosen` is `c`, `neigh` contains the character at index `i-1` and `i+1` of the string `s`, `c` is the next character in the sequence of `alpha` (the character following the current `c`)**
