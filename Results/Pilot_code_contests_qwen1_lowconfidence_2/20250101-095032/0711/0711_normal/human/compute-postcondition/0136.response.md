`chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is either `i_0 + 5` or `i_0 + 4`; `neigh` is updated to `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`; `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`; `alpha` must be a non-empty iterable; `chosen` is now equal to `c`; `ans2[i]` and `rec2` remain unchanged; the current value of `c` is not in `neigh`.
