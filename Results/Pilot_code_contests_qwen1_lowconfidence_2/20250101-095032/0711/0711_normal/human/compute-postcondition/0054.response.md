Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 2. If `i > 0` and `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or (`i < n - 1` and `s[i] == s[i + 1]`), then `neigh` remains unchanged (either `(s[1], s[i + 1])` if `i > 0` or `(s[1],)` if `i <= 0`); `alpha` must be an iterable containing at least one element; `chosen` is the first element from `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, or `chosen` remains `None` if no such element exists; `ans1[i]` is equal to `chosen`; `rec1` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `neigh` remains unchanged as per the initial rule (either `(s[1], s[i + 1])` if `i > 0` or `(s[1],)` if `i <= 0`).**
