The code `break` does not affect the values of `ans1` or `i`, but it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `valid1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` is a list of integers, `i` is `i+2`, `valid1` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
