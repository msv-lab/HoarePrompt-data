Postcondition: **`ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `valid1` is a boolean indicating whether no two consecutive characters in `ans1` are the same, `valid2` is `False` if the loop executed and found at least one pair of consecutive characters that are the same, otherwise `valid2` is `True`. The condition `(rec1 < rec2 and valid1 or not valid2)` is satisfied.**
