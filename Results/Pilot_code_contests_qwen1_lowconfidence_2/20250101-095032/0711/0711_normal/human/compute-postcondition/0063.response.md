`chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The previous value of `chosen` was the first element from `alpha` that is not in `neigh` or `None` if no such element exists. Since `c` is now assigned to `chosen`, the value of `chosen` is directly `c`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is either `()` or `(s[i + 1],)` with `s[i + 1]` added to it, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `chosen` is `c`, `ans1[i + 2]` is equal to `c`, `rec1` is increased by 1, and the current value of `c` is not in `neigh`**
