The code assigns the value of `c` to `chosen`. No other variables are affected. The output state is: `i` is \( i_0 + 2 \), `n` must be greater than \( i + 2 \), `s` is a sequence that ensures \( i < n - 1 \), and `chosen` is equal to `c`.

Output State: **`i` is \( i_0 + 2 \), `n` must be greater than \( i + 2 \), `s` is a sequence that ensures \( i < n - 1 \), and `chosen` is equal to `c`**
