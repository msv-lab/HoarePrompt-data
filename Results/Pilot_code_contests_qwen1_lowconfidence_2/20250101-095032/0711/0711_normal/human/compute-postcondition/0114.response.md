The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no loop or conditional statement is mentioned in the code snippet and the preconditions are not affected, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is \( i_0 + 2 \), `n` must be greater than \( i + 2 \), `s` is a sequence that ensures \( i < n - 1 \), and `chosen` is equal to `c`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
