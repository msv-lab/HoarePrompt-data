Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is either `()` or `(s[i + 1],)`, `alpha` must contain at least one unvisited element, `chosen` is `c`, `ans1[i + 2]` is defined (either as `c` or an undefined state depending on whether `c` is visited or not), `rec1` is increased by 1, and `c` is the first unvisited element in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`. If `c` is not in `neigh`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
