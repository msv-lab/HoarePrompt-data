The variable `valid1` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The current value of `ans1[i]` is equal to the previous value of `ans1[i-1]`, but this relationship does not change due to the assignment of `valid1`. Therefore, the only variable affected is `valid1`.

Output State: **`ans1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ans1`, `valid1` is `False`, the current value of `ans1[i]` is equal to the previous value of `ans1[i-1]`.**
