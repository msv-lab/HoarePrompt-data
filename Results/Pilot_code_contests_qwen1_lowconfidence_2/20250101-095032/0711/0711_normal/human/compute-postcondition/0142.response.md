Postcondition: ***`i` is either `i_0 + 6` or `i_0 + 5`, `neigh` is updated to `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, `alpha` must still be a non-empty iterable, `chosen` is now equal to `c` (or remains unchanged if `c` is already in `neigh`), `ans2[i]` and `rec2` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `c` is not in `neigh`.***
