The code `chosen = c` assigns the value of `c` to the variable `chosen`. The value of `c` is not specified, but since `chosen` is equal to `c` (or remains unchanged if `c` was already in `neigh`), the value of `chosen` will be `c`.

All other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is either `i_0 + 6` or `i_0 + 5`, `neigh` is updated to `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, `alpha` must still contain at least one element, `chosen` is equal to `c`, `ans2[i]` and `rec2` remain unchanged.**
