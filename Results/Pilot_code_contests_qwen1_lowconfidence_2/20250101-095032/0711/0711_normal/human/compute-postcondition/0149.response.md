`rec2` is incremented by 1, which means `rec2 += 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is either `i_0 + 6` or `i_0 + 5`, `neigh` is updated to `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, `alpha` is an empty iterable, `chosen` is equal to the last `c` such that `c` is not in `neigh`, `ans2[i]` is `chosen`, and `rec2` is increased by 1.
