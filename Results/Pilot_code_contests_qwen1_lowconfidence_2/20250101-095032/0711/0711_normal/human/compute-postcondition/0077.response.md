Postcondition: ***`i` is \(i + 2\), `neigh` is either `()` or `(\text{s}[i + 1],)`, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `chosen` is the first element in `alpha` that is not in `neigh` (if any); otherwise, it is `None`, `ans1[i + 2]` is now `chosen`, and `rec1` is increased by 1. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])` is satisfied or not since there is no else part changing these conditions.***
