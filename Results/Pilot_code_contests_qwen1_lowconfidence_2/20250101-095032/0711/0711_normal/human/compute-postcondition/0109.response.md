First, let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- Variable `i` is `i + 2`.
- If `i` is greater than 0, `neigh` is `(s[i - 1],)`.
- Otherwise, `neigh` remains an empty tuple ().

### Code Snippet:
```python
neigh += s[i + 1],
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Evaluate the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is defined as `i + 2`, the exact value of `i` before the code is run cannot be determined without additional context. However, it doesn't matter because the code depends on the value of `i` after it is updated in the first part of the initial state.
   
2. **Update the Value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is set to `i + 2`. After this operation, `i` is increased by 2.
   
3. **Determine the Value of `neigh`:**
   - From the initial state, if `i > 0`, `neigh` is `(s[i - 1],)`. Otherwise, `neigh` remains `()`.
   - Since `i` is now `i + 2`, and assuming `i` was initially set to some value such that `i + 2 > 0` (which is typical in most cases unless `i` was already very negative), `neigh` will be `(s[i - 1],)`.
   
4. **Impact of the Code Snippet:**
   - The code `neigh += s[i + 1],` appends `s[i + 1]` to `neigh`.
   - Given that `neigh` was previously `(s[i - 1],)` (if `i > 0`), the new value of `neigh` will be `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`.

### Output State:
- `i` is now `i + 2`.
- `neigh` is `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`; `neigh` is `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`**
