Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s` and must have at least 2 elements, `valid1` can be either `True` or `False`, `valid2` remains `False`, `i` is `len(ans2)`. If `ans2[i] == ans2[i - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ans2[i] != ans2[i - 1]`, the state remains unchanged.***
