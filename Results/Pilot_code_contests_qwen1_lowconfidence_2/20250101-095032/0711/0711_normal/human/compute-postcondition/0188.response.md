Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `valid1` indicates whether no two consecutive characters in `ans1` are the same, `valid2` is `True` if no pair of consecutive characters were found to be the same during the loop execution, `rec1` is printed if the condition `rec1 < rec2 and valid1 or not valid2` is met, and `rec2` remains unchanged if `valid2` is `True`. If `valid2` is `False`, `rec2` remains unchanged and `ans2` is undefined (NameError).***
