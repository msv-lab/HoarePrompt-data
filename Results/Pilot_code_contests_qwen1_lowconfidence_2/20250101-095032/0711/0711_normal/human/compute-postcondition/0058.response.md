Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is either an empty tuple `()` or `(s[i + 1],)`, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `chosen` is the first element from `alpha` that is not in `neigh` or `None` if no such element exists, `ans1[i + 2]` is equal to `chosen`, `rec1` is increased by 1.*** 

Explanation: 
- If `i > 0`, then `neigh` becomes `(s[i + 1],)`.
- If `i <= 0`, there is no change to `neigh` as there is no else part provided. Therefore, `neigh` remains an empty tuple `()`.
