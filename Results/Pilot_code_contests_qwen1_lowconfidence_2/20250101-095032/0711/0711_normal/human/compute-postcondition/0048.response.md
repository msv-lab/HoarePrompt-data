The variable `chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The value of `c` is the next element from `alpha`, and since `c` is not explicitly defined with a specific value in the initial state, we keep it as "the next element from `alpha`". The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `c` is the next element from `alpha`, `neigh` remains unchanged, `chosen` is the next element from `alpha`**
