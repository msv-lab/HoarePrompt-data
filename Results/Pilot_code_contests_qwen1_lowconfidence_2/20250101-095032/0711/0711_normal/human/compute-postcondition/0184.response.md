The code `print(''.join(ans1))` does not modify any variables. It simply joins the elements of the list `ans1` into a single string and prints it. The variables `valid1`, `valid2`, and `rec1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `valid1` is a boolean indicating whether no two consecutive characters in `ans1` are the same, `valid2` is `False` if the loop executed and found at least one pair of consecutive characters that are the same, otherwise `valid2` is `True`, and `rec1` is printed.**
