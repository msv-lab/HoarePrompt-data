The code initializes two variables `rec1` and `rec2` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `alpha`, `ans1`, or `ans2`. Therefore, the output state includes these variables in their original conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5Â·10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `ans2` is a list created from the string `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0.**
