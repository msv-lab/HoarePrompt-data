Postcondition: ***`i` is either `i_0 + 6` or `i_0 + 5`, `neigh` is updated to `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, `alpha` must still contain at least one element, `chosen` is equal to `c`, and `ans2[i]` and `rec2` remain unchanged. If `c` is not in `neigh`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
