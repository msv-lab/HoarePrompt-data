Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list created from the string `s`, `rec1` and `rec2` are integers. If `i > 0` and `s[i] == s[i - 1]` or `(i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])`, then `chosen` is the first character in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, `rec1` is 1, `rec2` is 0, and the `i`-th element of `ans1` is updated to `chosen`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
