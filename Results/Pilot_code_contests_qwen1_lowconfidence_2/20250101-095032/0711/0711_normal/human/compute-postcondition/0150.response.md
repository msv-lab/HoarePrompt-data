Postcondition: ***`i` is either `i_0 + 6` or `i_0 + 5`, `neigh` is updated to `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, `alpha` is an empty iterable, `chosen` is equal to the last `c` such that `c` is not in `neigh`, `ans2[i]` is `chosen`, and `rec2` is increased by 1.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the given if-else block. Since the else part is None, the postcondition directly follows from the if part, ensuring that all relevant variables and their states are accounted for after the execution of the if-else block.
