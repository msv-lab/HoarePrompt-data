Output State: **`i` is the largest even index less than the length of `s` such that `s[i]` is equal to its neighboring characters, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters at indices `i-1` and `i+1` if both are within bounds, `chosen` is the first character in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, `alpha` is an empty iterable, `ans2[i]` is assigned `chosen`, `rec2` is the number of valid replacements made, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user, `ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `rec1` is the number of valid replacements made, initially set to 0.**
