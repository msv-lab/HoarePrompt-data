Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5Â·10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is a string entered by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` and `ans2` are lists created from the string `s`, `rec1` and `rec2` are 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[i - 1]`, `i`, and `s[i + 1]`, and `chosen` is the next character in the `alpha` string.
