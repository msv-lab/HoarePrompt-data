Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is either `()` or `(s[i + 1],)` with `s[i + 1]` added to it, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `chosen` is the first element from `alpha` that is not in `neigh` or `None` if no such element exists, `ans1[i + 2]` is equal to `chosen`, `rec1` is increased by 1, and the current value of `c` is not in `neigh`***
