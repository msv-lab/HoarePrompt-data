The code `neigh = ()` assigns an empty tuple to the variable `neigh`. No other variables are affected. The precondition remains unchanged except for the value of `neigh`, which is now an empty tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5Â·10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user and its length must be at least 2, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `ans2` is a list created from the string `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is an empty tuple**.
