`rec1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chosen` is the first character in `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, `total` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user with a length of at least 2, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` is a list with the `i`-th element updated to `chosen`, `ans2` is a list created from the string `s`, `rec1` is 1, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[i - 1]`, `i`, and `s[i + 1]`.
