Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 5Â·10^5, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user and its length must be at least 2, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `ans2` is a list created from the string `s`, `rec1` is 0, `rec2` is 0, `neigh` is a tuple containing the characters `s[i - 1]`, `i`, and `s[i + 1]`. The condition `i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or (i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1])` is true, meaning either the current character `s[i]` is equal to the previous character `s[i - 1]` or the current character `s[i]` is equal to the next character `s[i + 1]`***
