`ans2[i]` is assigned the value of `chosen`. The value of `i` can be either `i_0 + 6` or `i_0 + 5`, and `chosen` is the last `c` such that `c` is not in `neigh`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is either `i_0 + 6` or `i_0 + 5`, `neigh` is updated to `(s[i - 1], s[i + 1])`, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, `alpha` is an empty iterable, `chosen` is equal to the last `c` such that `c` is not in `neigh`, `ans2[i]` is `chosen`, and `rec2` remains unchanged.**
