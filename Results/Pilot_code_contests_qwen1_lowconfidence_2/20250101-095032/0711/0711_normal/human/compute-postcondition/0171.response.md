The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code, the values of `ans1`, `valid1`, and `valid2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s` and must have at least 2 elements, `valid1` can be either `True` or `False`, `valid2` is `False`.**
