Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `alpha` must be an iterable containing at least one element, `neigh` remains unchanged (either `(s[1], s[i + 1])` if `i > 0` or `(s[1],)` if `i <= 0`), and `chosen` is the first element from `alpha` that is not in `neigh`, or `chosen` remains `None` if no such element exists.**
