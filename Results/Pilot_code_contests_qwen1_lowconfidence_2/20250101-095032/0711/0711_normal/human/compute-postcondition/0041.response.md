The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional block it is part of. However, since the initial state and the given code snippet do not specify a particular loop or conditional block, we assume the `break` statement is within a loop or conditional block that is not explicitly shown.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is greater than 0
- `alpha` must contain at least one element
- `c` is not in `neigh`
- `chosen` is equal to `c`

The `break` statement will cause the loop or conditional block to terminate, but it will not change the values of `i`, `alpha`, `c`, or `chosen`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `c` is not in `neigh`, `chosen` is equal to `c`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
