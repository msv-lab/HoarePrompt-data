The `break` statement does not change the values of variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. In this case, since there is no loop or switch statement present in the given code snippet, the only thing that happens is that we break out of the nearest loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `ans1`, `i`, and `valid1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ans1` and is now `i+1`, `valid1` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
