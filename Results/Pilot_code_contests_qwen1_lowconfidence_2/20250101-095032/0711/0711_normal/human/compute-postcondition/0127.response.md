Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer. If `i` is either `i_0 + 3` or `i_0 + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2` or the loop did not execute, `neigh` is either an empty tuple or contains valid neighbors based on the sequence `s`, `chosen` is set to `c` if `c` is not in `neigh` and the loop breaks, otherwise `chosen` remains undefined, `alpha` is unchanged, `ans2[i]` is assigned the value of `chosen`, `rec2` is incremented by 1. If the condition of the if statement is not met, the state of the program variables remains as in the precondition.***
