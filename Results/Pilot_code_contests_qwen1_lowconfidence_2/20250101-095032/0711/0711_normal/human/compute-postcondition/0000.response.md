`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that both `n` and `k` will now hold integer values corresponding to the inputs provided by the user, while the original conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 26 are preserved. The string representing the colors of the cells remains unchanged.

Output State: **1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5·10^5; 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 26; the string representing the colors of the cells remains unchanged; `n` and `k` are integers**
