Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `ans1`, and `valid1` is `False`. If the value of `ans1[i]` is equal to the value of `ans1[i-1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, no additional changes are made in this case.***
