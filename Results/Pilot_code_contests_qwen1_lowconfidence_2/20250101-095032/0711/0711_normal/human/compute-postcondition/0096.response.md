Postcondition: **`chosen` is `c`, `neigh` contains the character at index `i-1` (if `i > 0`) and the character at index `i + 1` of the string `s`, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(5 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26, `s` is the string entered by the user with at least 3 characters, `alpha` is the string containing the first `k` uppercase letters of the English alphabet, `ans1` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `ans2` is a list created from the string `s`, `rec1` is the number of valid replacements made, initially set to 0, `rec2` is 0, and `c` is the next character in the sequence of `alpha` (the character following the current `c`). If `c` is not in `neigh`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
