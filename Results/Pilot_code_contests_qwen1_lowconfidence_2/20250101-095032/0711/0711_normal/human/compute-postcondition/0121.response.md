`chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The value of `i` remains as `i_0 + 3`, the condition for `n` (that it must be greater than `i_0 + 5`) remains unchanged, the sequence `s` ensures that `i < n - 1`, and the value of `c` is stored in `chosen`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_0 + 3`, `n` must be greater than `i_0 + 5`, `s` is a sequence that ensures `i < n - 1`, `chosen` is `c`**
