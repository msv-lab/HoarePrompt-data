Postcondition: ***`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is either `()` or `(s[i + 1],)`, `alpha` must contain at least one element, `chosen` is the first element from `alpha` that is not in `neigh` (or `c` if `c` is not in `neigh`), `ans1[i + 2]` is equal to `chosen`, `rec1` is increased by 1, and the current value of `c` is checked against `neigh` and the appropriate action is taken (either setting `chosen` to `c` and breaking the loop or leaving `chosen` unchanged).***
