The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit the current loop or block of code. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i_0 + 3`, `n` must be greater than `i_0 + 5`, `s` is a sequence that ensures `i < n - 1`, `chosen` is `c` and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
