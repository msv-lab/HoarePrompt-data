`chosen` is assigned the value of `c`. The value of `neigh` and `c` are updated, but the value of `neigh` remains unchanged except that `c` within `neigh` is now `chosen`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`chosen` is `c`, `neigh` contains the character at index `i-1` and `i+1` of the string `s`, `c` is the next character in the sequence of `alpha` (the character following the current `c`)**
