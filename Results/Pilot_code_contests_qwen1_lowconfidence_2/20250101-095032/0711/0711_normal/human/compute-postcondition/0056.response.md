The code `neigh = ()` sets the variable `neigh` to an empty tuple. This does not affect the values of `i`, `alpha`, `chosen`, `ans1[i + 2]`, or `rec1`. 

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `neigh` is an empty tuple (), `alpha` must contain at least one element, `chosen` is the first element from `alpha` that is not in `neigh` or `None` if no such element exists, `ans1[i + 2]` is equal to `chosen`, `rec1` is increased by 1**
