The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program exits the loop or conditional block it was in. The preconditions and the values of the variables are preserved.

Output State: **`i` is \( i_0 + 3 \), `n` must be greater than \( i_0 + 5 \), `s` is a sequence that ensures \( i < n - 1 \), `c` must be in `neigh`, and `chosen` is equal to `c`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
