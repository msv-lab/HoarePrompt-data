You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.

Input

The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Output

Print a single integer — the required minimum number of repaintings. In the second line print any possible variant of the repainted stripe.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 26. The second input line is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters 'A' to 'J' (representing colors 1 to 10 since only the first 10 uppercase English letters are used when k ≤ 10), where each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    s = raw_input()
    alpha = string.uppercase[:k]
    ans1 = list(s)
    ans2 = list(s)
    rec1, rec2 = 0, 0
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        neigh = ()
        
        if i > 0:
            neigh += s[i - 1],
        
        if i < n - 1:
            neigh += s[i + 1],
        
        if i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] or i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]:

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
