You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.

Input

The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Output

Print a single integer — the required minimum number of repaintings. In the second line print any possible variant of the repainted stripe.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for some cases:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program tries to handle alternating colors but fails to account for all edge cases properly. Specifically, the logic inside the loops does not ensure that the minimum number of repaintings is achieved for all possible configurations of the input string.

2. **Inefficient Repainting Strategy**: The current strategy of trying to alternate every other cell might not always result in the minimum number of repaintings. For example, consider the input `AAABBB` with `k=3`. The program will attempt to alternate the cells but might not achieve the optimal solution of repainting just two cells to `AABBCC`.

3. **Break Statement Usage**: The usage of the `break` statement inside the nested loop can prematurely terminate the search for a suitable color, which might not lead to the optimal solution. This could cause the program to miss the possibility of fewer repaintings.

4. **No Global Minimum Check**: The program does not check whether the repainting strategy used results in the absolute minimum number of repaintings across different possible strategies. It only considers alternating every other cell, which might not always be the best approach.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the input `AAABBB` with `k=3`:

- Expected output should be `AABBCC` with only 2 repaintings.
- However, the program might output `ABABAB` with 3 repaintings, which is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

The second input line is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters 'A' to 'J' (representing colors 1 to 10 since only the first 10 uppercase English letters are used when k ≤ 10), where each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
