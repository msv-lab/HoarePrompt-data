You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A colored stripe is represented by a horizontal row of n square cells, each cell is pained one of k colors. Your task is to repaint the minimum number of cells so that no two neighbouring cells are of the same color. You can use any color from 1 to k to repaint the cells.

Input

The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105; 2 ≤ k ≤ 26). The second line contains n uppercase English letters. Letter "A" stands for the first color, letter "B" stands for the second color and so on. The first k English letters may be used. Each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

Output

Print a single integer — the required minimum number of repaintings. In the second line print any possible variant of the repainted stripe.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to minimize the number of repaintings by ensuring no two neighboring cells are of the same color. However, the logic to achieve this is flawed. Specifically, the program tries to repaint cells only at even and odd indices separately, which does not guarantee the minimum number of repaintings in all cases.

Consider the input:
```
4 3
BBBC
```
- The program will try to repaint at even indices first:
  - At index 0 (even), no action needed since 'B' != 'B'.
  - At index 2 (even), 'B' needs to be changed to 'A' to avoid conflict with 'C'.
- Next, it will try to repaint at odd indices:
  - At index 1 (odd), no action needed since 'B' != 'B'.
  - At index 3 (odd), no action needed since 'C' != 'C'.

The output will be:
```
1
BBCA
```
However, the optimal solution would be to repaint just one cell:
```
2
ABAC
```
Here, changing either 'B' at index 2 or 'B' at index 3 to 'A' results in no two neighboring cells being the same color, and only one repaint is needed. Therefore, the program does not always find the minimum number of repaintings, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

The second input line is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters 'A' to 'J' (representing colors 1 to 10 since only the first 10 uppercase English letters are used when k ≤ 10), where each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.

If `valid2` is `False`, `rec2` remains unchanged and `ans2` is undefined (NameError).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of uppercase English letters 'A' to 'J', where `1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 26`. It aims to modify the string such that no two adjacent characters are the same, while making the minimum number of changes. Specifically, the function creates two modified versions of the input string, `ans1` and `ans2`, and determines which version requires fewer modifications. The function then prints the number of modifications made and the modified string that required fewer changes.
