Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code only considers painting cells at even indices (for `ans1`) and odd indices (for `ans2`). This approach fails to ensure that the minimum number of repaintings is achieved in all scenarios, particularly when the original sequence already has a pattern that could be maintained with fewer repaintings.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 3
ABBA
```
- The correct solution would be to repaint only one cell to achieve the desired result: "ABCA".
- However, the current code will not consider this optimal solution because it only looks at cells at even and odd indices separately.

To fix this, the code needs to consider all possible repaintings for each cell, not just those at specific indices. A more comprehensive approach would involve checking each cell and determining the minimum repaintings needed to ensure no two adjacent cells have the same color.
