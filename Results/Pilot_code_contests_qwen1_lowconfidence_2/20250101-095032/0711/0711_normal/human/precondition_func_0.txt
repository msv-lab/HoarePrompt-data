n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 26. The second input line is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters 'A' to 'J' (representing colors 1 to 10 since only the first 10 uppercase English letters are used when k ≤ 10), where each letter represents the color of the corresponding cell of the stripe.
