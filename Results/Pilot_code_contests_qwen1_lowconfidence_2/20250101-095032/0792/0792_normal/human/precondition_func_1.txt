None of the variables (n, m, k, p1, p2, ..., pn) are explicitly defined or passed to the function `func_2` in the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that `func_4()` should be a function that provides input data in the required format. Specifically, `func_4()` should return a string containing space-separated integers representing the sequence of n integers p1, p2, ..., pn, followed by three space-separated integers n, m, and k.
