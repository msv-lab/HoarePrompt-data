The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `p` (a positive integer such that \( p > 2 \)), and returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \). The function uses the built-in `pow` function to compute this value efficiently. This operation is known as modular exponentiation and is particularly useful in cryptography and number theory. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond the computation specified. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `p` do not meet the required conditions (i.e., `n` is not a positive integer or `p` is less than or equal to 2), in which case the `pow` function will raise a `ValueError`. However, since the function signature and the `pow` function handle these cases internally, no additional error checking is necessary within this function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the computed value of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \).
