The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\) and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n` in ascending order. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisors and adding them to the list `l`. If `i` is a divisor of `n`, both `i` and `n // i` are added to `l`. This ensures that each divisor is included only once, maintaining the uniqueness of the elements in the list. The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is a perfect square by including the square root only once.
