The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns a map object. This map object contains integers derived from a string returned by `func_4()`, which is expected to provide a sequence of space-separated integers followed by three additional space-separated integers representing `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function assumes that `func_4()` correctly formats the string as described. If `func_4()` does not return a properly formatted string, the map object returned by `func_2` might contain incorrect or missing values.
