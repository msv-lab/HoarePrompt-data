#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the modulo value, and p is a positive integer such that p > 2.
def func_1(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \) where \( n \) is a positive integer and \( p \) is a positive integer such that \( p > 2 \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `p` (a positive integer such that \( p > 2 \)), and returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \). The function uses the built-in `pow` function to compute this value efficiently. This operation is known as modular exponentiation and is particularly useful in cryptography and number theory. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond the computation specified. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `p` do not meet the required conditions (i.e., `n` is not a positive integer or `p` is less than or equal to 2), in which case the `pow` function will raise a `ValueError`. However, since the function signature and the `pow` function handle these cases internally, no additional error checking is necessary within this function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the computed value of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables (n, m, k, p1, p2, ..., pn) are explicitly defined or passed to the function `func_2` in the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that `func_4()` should be a function that provides input data in the required format. Specifically, `func_4()` should return a string containing space-separated integers representing the sequence of n integers p1, p2, ..., pn, followed by three space-separated integers n, m, and k.
def func_2():
    return map(int, func_4().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts a string containing space-separated integers into integers, followed by three integers n, m, and k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns a map object. This map object contains integers derived from a string returned by `func_4()`, which is expected to provide a sequence of space-separated integers followed by three additional space-separated integers representing `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function assumes that `func_4()` correctly formats the string as described. If `func_4()` does not return a properly formatted string, the map object returned by `func_2` might contain incorrect or missing values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, but based on the context, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ (m × k) ≤ n ≤ 5000, and a list of integers p is provided as input to the function.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_4().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by mapping int to each element in the list split from the output of func_4()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` returns a list of integers. It achieves this by first calling another function `func_4()`, which presumably returns a string containing space-separated integers. This string is then split into a list of strings, and each string is converted to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting map object is then converted to a list. The function does not modify any input parameters and only returns the processed list of integers. Potential edge cases include the possibility that `func_4()` might return an empty string or a string without any valid integers, in which case the returned list would be empty. There is no explicit handling of non-integer values in the input string, so if `func_4()` returns a string with non-integer values, those would be ignored.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables' values or their relationships are provided within the function signature. However, based on the problem description, n, m, and k are integers representing the length of the sequence, the size of each segment, and the number of segments to choose, respectively, and the sequence p is a list of non-negative integers.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` simply returns input from the user without performing any additional operations on the input variables. It accepts no parameters and does not modify any variables. The function concludes by waiting for user input and then returning it. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, as it directly returns the input from the user as stated in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables' values or their relationships are provided within the function signature or the program itself. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that the function does not take any input parameters and returns an integer which is used as part of the overall solution.
def func_5():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` accepts no parameters and returns an integer input by the user. After the function concludes, the program will have received an integer input from the user. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, in which case the `input()` function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle this exception, so the program may crash if the user does not enter an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and both x and y are non-negative after taking their absolute values.
def func_6(x, y):
    x = abs(x)
    y = abs(y)
    if (min(x, y) == 0) :
        return max(x, y)
        #The program returns x if x is non-negative and y (which is the same as x) is the absolute value of its original value, otherwise it returns y which is 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is the absolute value of its original value, and at least one of `x` and `y` is greater than 0
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the GCD of the original values of x and y, given that y is now 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are integers. It first ensures that both `x` and `y` are non-negative by taking their absolute values. 

- If either `x` or `y` is zero, the function checks whether `x` is non-negative. If `x` is non-negative, it returns `x`; otherwise, it returns `y`, which is guaranteed to be zero.
- If neither `x` nor `y` is zero, the function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop, `x` holds the GCD, and `y` is zero. The function then returns `x`.

Thus, the function ultimately returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y` if both are non-zero, or `x` if `x` is non-negative and `y` is zero, or zero otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
def func_7(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                l.append(i)
            else:
                l.append(i)
                l.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `l` is the list of all unique divisors of `n` in ascending order.
    return l
    #`The program returns the list `l` which contains all unique divisors of integer `n` in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\) and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n` in ascending order. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisors and adding them to the list `l`. If `i` is a divisor of `n`, both `i` and `n // i` are added to `l`. This ensures that each divisor is included only once, maintaining the uniqueness of the elements in the list. The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is a perfect square by including the square root only once.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the upper limit for checking prime numbers, and the function is not directly related to solving the main problem described in the problem statement.
def func_8(n):
    prime = [(True) for i in range(n + 1)]
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if prime[p] == True:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
        
        p += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'p' is the largest prime number found such that \( p^2 \leq n \), 'n' is a positive integer, and 'prime' is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements remain `True` unless they are from index \( p^2 \) to index \( n \), in which case they are `False`
    f = []
    for p in range(2, n):
        if prime[p]:
            f.append(p)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is the largest prime number such that \( p^2 \leq n \) and \( p \leq n \), `n` is a positive integer, `prime` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements remain `True` unless they are from index \( p^2 \) to index \( n \), in which case they are `False`, and `f` is a list containing all prime numbers less than or equal to `p`.
    return f
    #The program returns a list `f` containing all prime numbers less than or equal to `p`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts an integer `n` representing the upper limit for checking prime numbers. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers up to `n` and then collects all prime numbers up to `n` into a list `f`. After the function concludes, it returns the list `f` containing all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. The function handles the case when `n` is less than 2 by ensuring the list remains empty. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
