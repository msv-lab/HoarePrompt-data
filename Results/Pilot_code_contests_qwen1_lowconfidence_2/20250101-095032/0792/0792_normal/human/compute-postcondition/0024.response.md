State: **`p` is 4, `n` must be at least 16, `i` must be equal to \(4^2 = 16\)**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop starts with `i` in the range from `p * p` to `n + 1` with a step of `p`. This means `i` will start from \(4^2 = 16\) and increment by 4 each time.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `p` is 4.
   - `n` must be at least 16.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `p * p`, which is \(4^2 = 16\).

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` (which is 16) must be within the range specified by the loop, i.e., between `p * p` and `n + 1`.
   - Given `p * p` is 16, `i` must be at least 16.
   - Since `n` must be at least 16, `i` will be within the range if `n` is exactly 16 or more.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `p` is 4.
   - `n` must be at least 16.
   - `i` must be equal to 16, the starting value of the loop.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:
State: **`p` is 4, `n` must be at least 16, `i` must be equal to 16**
