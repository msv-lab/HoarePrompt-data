According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the condition `p * p <= n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 4 and `n` is at least 9.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if the current value of `p * p` is still less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `p` is currently 4 and `n` is at least 9:
- The current value of `p * p` is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- Since 16 is not less than or equal to 9, the condition `p * p <= n` is false.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `p * p <= n` must be true. Therefore, `n` must be increased to a value that satisfies this condition. The smallest such value is 16 (since \(4 \times 4 = 16\)).

No other states need to be adjusted because the only condition for the loop to continue is the comparison `p * p <= n`, and `p` itself does not change within the loop body.

State: **`p` is 4 and `n` must be at least 16**
