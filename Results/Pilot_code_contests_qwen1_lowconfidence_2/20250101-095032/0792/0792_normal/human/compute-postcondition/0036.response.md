Postcondition: ***`p` is the largest prime number such that \( p^2 \leq n \), and `p` must be less than or equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `prime` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements remain `True` unless they are from index \( p^2 \) to index \( n \), in which case they are `False`, and `f` is an empty list. The current value of `prime[p]` is `True`.***
