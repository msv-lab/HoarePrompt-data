Output State: **`p` is 4, `n` is at least 16, `prime[i]` for all `i` in the range `[p * p, n]` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Initialization and Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i` initialized to `p * p`, which is `16` in this case.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by `p`, which is `4`.
   - The variable `prime[i]` is set to `False`.

3. **Final Values After Loop Completion:**
   - The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n`.
   - All indices `i` in the range `[p * p, n]` (i.e., `[16, n]`) will have `prime[i]` set to `False`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop must start with `p` being `4` and `n` being at least `16`.
   - If `n` is less than `16`, the loop will not execute at all, and `prime[i]` for all `i` in the range `[16, n]` will remain unchanged (initially they could be any value).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - After the loop completes, `prime[i]` will be `False` for all `i` in the range `[16, n]`.
   - The values of `p` and `n` remain as they were initially, with `p` being `4` and `n` being at least `16`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `prime[i]` for all `i` in the range `[16, n]` is `False`.
