`p` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are initially `True` unless they are from index `p * p` to index `n`, and these are set to `False`, the value of `p` changes but does not affect the initial condition of `prime` unless `prime[p]` becomes `False`.

Given the initial state:
- `p` is an integer
- `n` is a positive integer at least 4
- `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `True` unless they are from index `p * p` to index `n`, in which case they are `False`

Since only `p` is incremented and there is no condition given that would make `prime[p]` `False`, the list `prime` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is an integer + 1, `n` is a positive integer at least 4, and `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements remain `True` unless they are from index `p * p` to index `n`, in which case they are `False`.**
