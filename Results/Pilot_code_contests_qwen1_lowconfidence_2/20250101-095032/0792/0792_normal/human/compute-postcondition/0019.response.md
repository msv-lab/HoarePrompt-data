The code `prime[i] = False` sets the value of `prime[i]` to `False`. Given the initial state, `i` is 15 and the loop condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since the code does not affect `i` or `n`, the value of `i` remains 15, and the loop condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 15, prime[15] is False**
