The code snippet `f.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Since `f` was initially an empty list, after appending `p`, `f` will contain the element `p`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`p` is the largest prime number such that \( p^2 \leq n \), and `p` must be less than or equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `prime` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements remain `True` unless they are from index \( p^2 \) to index \( n \), in which case they are `False`, and `f` is a list containing `[p]`. The current value of `prime[p]` is `True`.**
