The code snippet appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Since `p` is the largest prime number such that \( (p+1)^2 \leq n \) and \( p+1 \leq n \), the value of `p` remains unchanged. The value of `f` is updated to include the new element `p`.

Output State: **`p` is the largest prime number such that \( (p+1)^2 \leq n \) and \( p+1 \leq n \); `f` is a list containing its previous elements plus `p`.**
