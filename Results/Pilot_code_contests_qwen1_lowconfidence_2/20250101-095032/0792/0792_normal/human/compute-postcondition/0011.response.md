Postcondition: ***`p` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer at least 4, and `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements remain `True` unless they are starting from the index `p * p` and go up to the index `n`, in which case they become `False`. If `prime[p]` is `True`, then `prime` remains as described. If `prime[p]` is `False`, then `prime` is updated such that all elements from index `p * p` to index `n` are set to `False`.***
