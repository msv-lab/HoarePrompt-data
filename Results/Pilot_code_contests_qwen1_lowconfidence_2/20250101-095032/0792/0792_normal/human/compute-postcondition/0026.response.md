According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the value of `p`. The loop will continue if `i` is within the range specified by `p * p` to `n + 1` (inclusive) with a step of `p`.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
- `p` is 4
- `n` must be at least 16
- `i` is 16
- `prime[16]` is `False`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i` must be within the range from `p * p` to `n + 1` (inclusive) with a step of `p`.
2. `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that `p` is 4, `p * p` is 16. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `i` is currently 16, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by `p` (which is 4). Thus, `i` should become 20.

To ensure the loop continues, `n` must still be at least 16 (as it was before, since the loop condition only depends on `i` being within the range).

So, the updated states are:
- `p` remains 4
- `n` must still be at least 16
- `i` becomes 20
- `prime[20]` is unknown (but it does not affect the loop condition)

State: **`p` is 4, `n` must be at least 16, `i` is 20, `prime[20]` is unknown**
