Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `p * p <= n`. For the loop to continue executing, this condition must be true.

2. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `p` is an integer + 1 (i.e., `p` is at least 2).
   - `n` is a positive integer at least 4.
   - `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements remain `True` unless they are from index `p * p` to index `n`, in which case they are `False`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `p * p <= n` must still hold true.
   - Since `p` is an integer + 1, we need to consider the next possible value for `p` that would satisfy the loop condition. 

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - If `p * p <= n` is true at the end of the previous iteration, then incrementing `p` by 1 will result in `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. 
   - We need to ensure that `(p + 1) * (p + 1) <= n` holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Ensuring the Condition Holds**:
   - Given that `p` is an integer + 1, the smallest possible value for `p` is 2 (since `p` is at least 2). 
   - If `p` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then `p` should now be 3 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the condition `3 * 3 <= n` must hold true for the next iteration. This means `n` must be at least 9 (since `3 * 3 = 9`).

6. **Final Adjustments**:
   - We need to adjust the value of `p` to 3 for the next iteration.
   - Ensure that `n` is at least 9 to satisfy the condition `p * p <= n`.

Therefore, the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`p` is 3, `n` is at least 9**
