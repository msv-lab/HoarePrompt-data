Functionality: **The function `func_8` accepts an integer `n` representing the upper limit for checking prime numbers. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers up to `n` and then collects all prime numbers up to `n` into a list `f`. After the function concludes, it returns the list `f` containing all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. The function handles the case when `n` is less than 2 by ensuring the list remains empty. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.**
