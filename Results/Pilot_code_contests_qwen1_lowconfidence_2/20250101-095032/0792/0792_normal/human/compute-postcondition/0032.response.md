`p` is incremented by 1, so `p` is now 5. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition regarding the `prime` list also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is 5 and `n` is at least 16. If `prime[4]` is `True`, then for all `i` in the range `[p * p, n]`, `prime[i]` is `False`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if `prime[4]` is not `True`.
