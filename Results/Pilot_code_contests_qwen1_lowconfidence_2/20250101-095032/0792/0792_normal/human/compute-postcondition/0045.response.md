Output State: **`p` is the largest prime number such that \( p^2 \leq n \) and \( p \leq n \), `n` is a positive integer, `prime` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements remain `True` unless they are from index \( p^2 \) to index \( n \), in which case they are `False`, and `f` is a list containing all prime numbers less than or equal to `p`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Initialization and Conditions**:
   - The loop runs for each integer `p` from 2 to `n`.
   - The condition `if prime[p]:` checks if the current index `p` is still marked as `True` in the `prime` list. This means `p` is a prime number.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - Each time the condition `if prime[p]:` is true, the value `p` is appended to the list `f`.
   - As the loop progresses, `p` increases, and it continues to check and append all prime numbers less than or equal to `n` to the list `f`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes all its iterations, `p` will be the largest prime number such that \( p^2 \leq n \) and \( p \leq n \).
   - The list `f` will contain all prime numbers less than or equal to `p`.

4. **No Execution Case**:
   - If there are no prime numbers up to `n`, `f` will remain an empty list.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
