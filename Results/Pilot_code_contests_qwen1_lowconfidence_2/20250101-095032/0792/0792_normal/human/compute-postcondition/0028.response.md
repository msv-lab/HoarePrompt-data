Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `p` is 4
   - `n` must be at least 16
   - `i` is 20
   - `prime[20]` is `False`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from `p * p` up to `n + 1` with a step size of `p`.
   - This means the loop starts at `4 * 4 = 16` and increments by 4 (since `p` is 4) until it reaches a value that is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is currently 20.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - The next value of `i` would be `i + p`, which is `20 + 4 = 24`.

5. **Check if the Loop Can Continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is 20 and the next value `i` will be 24, we need to check if `24` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

6. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 23 (since `24 <= n + 1` implies `n >= 23`).
   - `p` remains 4.
   - `i` becomes 24.
   - `prime[24]` is unknown at this point but will be checked in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`p` is 4, `n` must be at least 23, `i` is 24, `prime[24]` is unknown**
