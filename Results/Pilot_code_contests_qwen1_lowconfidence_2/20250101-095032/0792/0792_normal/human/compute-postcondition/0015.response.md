`prime[i]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `i` is 9, so `prime[9]` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is not specified, `i` is 9, `p` is 3, `n` must be at least 9, and `prime[9]` is `False`.

Output State: **`total` is not specified, `i` is 9, `p` is 3, `n` must be at least 9, and `prime[9]` is `False`**
