The function `func_3()` returns a list of integers. It achieves this by first calling another function `func_4()`, which presumably returns a string containing space-separated integers. This string is then split into a list of strings, and each string is converted to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting map object is then converted to a list. The function does not modify any input parameters and only returns the processed list of integers. Potential edge cases include the possibility that `func_4()` might return an empty string or a string without any valid integers, in which case the returned list would be empty. There is no explicit handling of non-integer values in the input string, so if `func_4()` returns a string with non-integer values, those would be ignored.
