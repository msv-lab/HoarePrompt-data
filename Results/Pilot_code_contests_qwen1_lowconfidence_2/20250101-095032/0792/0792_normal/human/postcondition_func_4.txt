The function `func_5()` accepts no parameters and returns an integer input by the user. After the function concludes, the program will have received an integer input from the user. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, in which case the `input()` function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle this exception, so the program may crash if the user does not enter an integer.
