Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the calculation of the minimum distance `d(i, j)` between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time. The program uses an order tree data structure to keep track of the positions of points, but it seems to be incorrectly updating and querying this tree.

In particular, the update and query operations in the order tree class do not seem to align with the requirements of the problem. The `update` method updates the tree with the current position and speed of a point, but the `query` method does not seem to correctly compute the minimum distance between pairs of points.

Here is an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 3 2
-100 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
```

However, running the provided program with this input will not yield the correct result. The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum distances between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time.

To fix the program, the `update` and `query` methods in the `order_tree` class need to be re-implemented to properly handle the calculation of minimum distances. Specifically, the `query` method should return the minimum distance between the queried position and all other positions in the tree, taking into account their speeds and initial positions.
