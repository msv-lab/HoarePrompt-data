Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The `order_tree` class's `query` and `update` methods do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. The `query` method does not correctly compute the minimum distance between a given position and all other positions in the tree, taking into account their speeds and initial positions.
2. The `update` method updates the tree with the current position and speed of a point, but the `query` method does not use this information to correctly calculate the minimum distances.

The annotated version confirms that the program attempts to use an order tree to manage the positions and speeds of the points, but the implementation of the tree's methods does not align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points.

Given the issues highlighted by the annotated version, the original assessment that the program is incorrect remains valid.
