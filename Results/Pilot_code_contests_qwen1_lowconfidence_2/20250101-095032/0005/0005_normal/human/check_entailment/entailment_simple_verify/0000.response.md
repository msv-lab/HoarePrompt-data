Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Incorrect Data Structure Usage**: The `order_tree` class is used in a manner that does not align with the problem requirements. The program uses a segment tree (or a similar data structure) for operations that do not match the necessary computations for finding minimum distances over all pairs of points.

2. **Misinterpretation of Problem Requirements**: The problem requires calculating the minimum distance between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time. The current implementation seems to be attempting to solve a different problem involving order statistics and updates, which is not relevant to the actual problem at hand.

3. **Logic Flaw in Distance Calculation**: The program attempts to use a segment tree to compute some values related to distances, but it does not correctly reflect the logic needed to find the minimum distances between points. Specifically, the `query` and `update` methods in the `order_tree` class are not used to calculate distances as described in the problem statement.

4. **Sorting and Processing Logic**: While the program sorts the points based on their initial coordinates and processes the speeds, the way it uses these sorted and processed values to compute distances is incorrect. The core logic of comparing the relative positions of points over time is missing.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained. The annotated version reinforces that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
