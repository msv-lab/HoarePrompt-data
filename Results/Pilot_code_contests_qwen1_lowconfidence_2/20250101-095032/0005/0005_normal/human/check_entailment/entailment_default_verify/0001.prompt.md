You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t can be non-integer) is calculated as x_i + t ⋅ v_i.

Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.

Your task is to calculate the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of points.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), where x_i is the initial coordinate of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all x_i are distinct.

The third line of the input contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8), where v_i is the speed of the i-th point.

Output

Print one integer — the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the calculation of the minimum distance `d(i, j)` between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time. The program uses an order tree data structure to keep track of the positions of points, but it seems to be incorrectly updating and querying this tree.

In particular, the update and query operations in the order tree class do not seem to align with the requirements of the problem. The `update` method updates the tree with the current position and speed of a point, but the `query` method does not seem to correctly compute the minimum distance between pairs of points.

Here is an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 3 2
-100 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
```

However, running the provided program with this input will not yield the correct result. The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum distances between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time.

To fix the program, the `update` and `query` methods in the `order_tree` class need to be re-implemented to properly handle the calculation of minimum distances. Specifically, the `query` method should return the minimum distance between the queried position and all other positions in the tree, taking into account their speeds and initial positions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value read from standard input using `BytesIO()` and `readline()` methods. It assumes that the standard input contains data written to `sys.stdout` during the execution of the program. However, the function has a few issues. Firstly, the initialization of `sys.stdout` to `BytesIO()` and the registration of an exit handler to write the contents of `sys.stdout` back to standard output seems unnecessary for the function's intended purpose. Secondly, the function returns the result of `os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)`, which reads data from standard input based on the file size, which might not always be appropriate if the standard input is not exactly the same size as the initial output to `sys.stdout`. The function also does not handle potential errors during these operations, such as issues with file descriptors or input/output errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
