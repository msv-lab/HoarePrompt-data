Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The `order_tree` class's `query` and `update` methods do not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the minimum distances between pairs of points over any possible moments of time. 

The `query` method does not properly handle the calculation of the minimum distance, and the `update` method does not ensure that the tree maintains the correct information about the positions and speeds of the points. The annotations indicate that the program is trying to use an order tree to manage these calculations, but the implementation details suggest that the tree is not being used correctly.

For instance, the `query` method sums up values and counts without considering the initial positions and speeds of the points, which is critical for calculating the minimum distance. The `update` method simply adds the current position and speed to the tree, but it does not ensure that the tree reflects the correct state for all possible times.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
