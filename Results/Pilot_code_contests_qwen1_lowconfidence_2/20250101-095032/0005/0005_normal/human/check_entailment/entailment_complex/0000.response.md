Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires calculating the sum of minimum distances \( \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} d(i, j) \) where \( d(i, j) \) is the minimum possible distance between points \(i\) and \(j\) over any possible moments of time.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Distance \(d(i, j)\)**:
   - The program uses a segment tree (`order_tree`) to keep track of the points' positions, but it doesn't properly calculate the minimum distance \(d(i, j)\) between each pair of points.
   - The segment tree queries and updates are based on the initial coordinates and speeds of the points, but they do not account for the relative movement of the points over time.

2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem Requirement**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum distance between each pair of points at any moment in time. This involves considering the points' movements over a continuous range of times.
   - The current implementation focuses on the initial positions and speeds, but does not dynamically adjust the distances as the points move over time.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve sorting the points based on their initial positions and then considering the relative movements to find the minimum distances.
   - The provided code does not implement this dynamic adjustment of distances over time, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correct Implementation Explanation:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Sort the points based on their initial positions.
2. Use a sweep line algorithm to consider the movements of points and calculate the minimum distances dynamically as the points move.
3. Maintain a data structure (like a priority queue or set) to keep track of the points and their relative positions as they move.

The provided code does not follow this approach and instead uses a segment tree, which is not suitable for this specific problem.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is hence **False**.
