Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the task described. The program attempts to use an order tree (a type of data structure) to solve the problem, but the implementation is flawed and does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points.

The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Use of Order Tree**: The order tree is used to keep track of the coordinates and speeds, but the query and update operations are not implemented correctly to solve the problem. The program needs to correctly manage the relative positions of points over time and calculate the minimum distances.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic for calculating the minimum distance between points at different times is not correctly implemented. The program does not properly handle the calculation of the distances between points as they move over time.

3. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The use of an order tree and custom functions like `func_1` and `rints` adds unnecessary complexity and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly. These parts of the code do not align with the problem requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to sort the points based on their initial coordinates and speeds, and then calculate the relative positions over time to find the minimum distances between each pair of points. The current implementation does not achieve this correctly.
