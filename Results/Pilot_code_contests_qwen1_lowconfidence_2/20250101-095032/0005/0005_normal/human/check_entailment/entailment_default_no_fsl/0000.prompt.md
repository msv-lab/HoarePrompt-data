You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t can be non-integer) is calculated as x_i + t ⋅ v_i.

Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.

Your task is to calculate the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of points.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), where x_i is the initial coordinate of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all x_i are distinct.

The third line of the input contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8), where v_i is the speed of the i-th point.

Output

Print one integer — the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

from sys import stdin

    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.n = len(arr)
        self.tree = [[0, 0] for _ in range(self.n * 2)]
        self.order = defaultdict(int, {arr[i]: i for i in range(self.n)})

    def query(self, l):
        (res, coun) = (0, 0)
        l = self.order[l] + self.n
        r = self.n * 2

rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in input().split()]
(n, a) = (int(input()), sorted(map(lambda x, y: [x, y], rints(), rints())))

(tree, ans) = (order_tree(dis), 0)
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    (su, coun) = tree.query(a[i][1])
    ans += su - coun * a[i][0]
    tree.update(a[i][1], a[i][0])
print(ans)

def func_1():
    import os, sys, atexit
    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline


```
Output hints: The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value read from standard input using `BytesIO()` and `readline()` methods. It assumes that the standard input contains data written to `sys.stdout` during the execution of the program. However, the function has a few issues. Firstly, the initialization of `sys.stdout` to `BytesIO()` and the registration of an exit handler to write the contents of `sys.stdout` back to standard output seems unnecessary for the function's intended purpose. Secondly, the function returns the result of `os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)`, which reads data from standard input based on the file size, which might not always be appropriate if the standard input is not exactly the same size as the initial output to `sys.stdout`. The function also does not handle potential errors during these operations, such as issues with file descriptors or input/output errors.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
