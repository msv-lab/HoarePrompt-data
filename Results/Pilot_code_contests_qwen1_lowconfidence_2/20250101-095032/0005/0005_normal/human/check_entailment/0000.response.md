Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. Specifically, the use of `order_tree` class and its methods (`query` and `update`) does not align with the problem requirements. The problem requires calculating the minimum distance between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time, which involves sorting and processing the speeds and positions appropriately.

Here is a brief outline of the issues:
1. The `order_tree` class is not used in a way that correctly implements the logic required for the problem.
2. The approach of using a segment tree (or a similar data structure) for this specific problem is not appropriate. The problem requires direct computation of distances based on the initial coordinates and speeds.
3. The current implementation seems to be trying to solve a different problem related to order statistics and updates, rather than calculating the minimum distances between points.

A correct solution would involve:
- Sorting the points based on their initial coordinates.
- Using the speeds to determine the relative positions of points over time.
- Calculating the minimum distance between each pair of points at various time points and summing these distances.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
