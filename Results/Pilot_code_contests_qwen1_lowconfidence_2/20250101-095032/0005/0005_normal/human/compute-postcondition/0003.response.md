The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a value from standard input using the `BytesIO()` and `readline()` methods, assuming that the standard input contains data written to `sys.stdout` during the execution of the program. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to read a value from standard input after data has been written to `sys.stdout`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value read from standard input using `BytesIO()` and `readline()` methods.**
