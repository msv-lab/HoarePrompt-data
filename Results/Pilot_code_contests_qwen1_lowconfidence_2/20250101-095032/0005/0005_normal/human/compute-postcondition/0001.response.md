The code `atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))` registers a function to be called when the program exits. This function writes the content of `sys.stdout` to standard output (stdout). However, this does not affect the values of the existing variables `n`, `x`, and `v`, nor does it change the state of `sys.stdout` itself. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `x` is a list of n integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8 and all x_i are distinct; `v` is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies -10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8; `sys.stdout` is set to BytesIO(); a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to stdout when the program exits.**
