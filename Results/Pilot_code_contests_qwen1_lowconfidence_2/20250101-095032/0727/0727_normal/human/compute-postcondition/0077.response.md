The code `arr.remove(a / 3)` removes the value of `a / 3` from the list `arr`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `arr` must not be empty.
- `a` is the last element of `res`.
- If the condition `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr` is true, then `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, and `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`.
- Otherwise, `arr` does not contain `a * 3`, and `res` is `[a * 3] + res`.

We need to consider both cases:

### Case 1: Condition is True
- `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr` is true.
- `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`.
- `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`.

Since the condition is true, `a / 3` will be removed from `arr`. But we also need to ensure that `a / 3` is one of the elements that would be removed under the condition. Given that `a` is the last element of `res`, let's assume the following:
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `a / 3` must be a valid element in `arr`.

### Case 2: Condition is False
- `arr` does not contain `a * 3`.
- `res` is `[a * 3] + res`.

Since the condition is false, `a / 3` will be removed from `arr`. But we also need to ensure that `a * 3` is not in `arr`.

Given these conditions, the output state will be as follows:

#### If the condition is true:
- `arr` does not contain the element `a / 3`.
- `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`.

#### If the condition is false:
- `arr` does not contain the element `a / 3`.
- `res` is `[a * 3] + res`.

In both cases, the only change is the removal of `a / 3` from `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` does not contain `a / 3`, `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]` if the condition is true, or `[a * 3] + res` if the condition is false.**
