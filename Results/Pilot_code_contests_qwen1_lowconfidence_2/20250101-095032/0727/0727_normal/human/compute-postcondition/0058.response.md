The code `arr.remove(a / 3)` attempts to remove the value `a / 3` from the list `arr`. However, based on the initial state, `arr` must contain `a / 2`, not `a / 3`. This means that `arr.remove(a / 3)` will raise a `ValueError` because `a / 3` is not in `arr`.

Since the removal operation cannot be performed due to the error, the only impacted variable is `arr`, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `res[-1]`, `arr` must contain `a / 2`, if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is not in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a / 2] + res`, if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `res` is updated to `[a * 3, a]` if `a * 3` is in `arr`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `arr` remains unchanged.**
