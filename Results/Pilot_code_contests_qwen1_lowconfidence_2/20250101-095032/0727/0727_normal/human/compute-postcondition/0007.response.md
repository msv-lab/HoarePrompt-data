Postcondition: ***The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is in the range 1 to 3 ⋅ 10^{18}, and these numbers can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is set to positive infinity. Additionally, if `sys.subversion[0]` equals 'PyPy', then `sys.stdin` is an in-memory bytes buffer containing the original input data, `sys.stdout` is set to an in-memory bytes buffer, and `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the trailing newline character. Otherwise, the state of `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `raw_input` remains unchanged.***
