The code `res = res + [a / 3]` adds the value of `a / 3` to the list `res`. Let's break down the impact:

1. Initially, `res` is defined based on the condition `res[-1]` which means the last element of `res`.
2. The code appends `a / 3` to `res`.

Given the conditions for `res`:
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is not in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a / 2] + res`.
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `res` is updated to `[a * 3, a]` if `a * 3` is in `arr`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.

Since the code only appends `a / 3` to `res` and does not change the conditions under which `res` was initially set, the impact on `res` is simply adding `a / 3` to its end. 

Output State: **`a` is `res[-1]`, `arr` contains `a / 2` if `a % 2 == 0`, `res` is `res + [a / 3]`, `arr` remains unchanged**.
