Postcondition: ***`a` is `res[-1]` which is `a / 2`, `res` contains `[a * 2]` if `a * 2` is added to it, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` does not contain `a * 2`, `sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `a % 3 != 0` or `a / 3` is not in `arr`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as above when the condition `a * 2 in arr` is false.***
