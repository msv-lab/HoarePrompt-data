The given code snippet initializes the constant `INF` to positive infinity. This does not affect any of the input variables or the list of integers. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the definition of `INF`.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is in the range 1 to 3 ⋅ 10^{18}, and these numbers can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is set to positive infinity.**
