Postcondition: ***`a` is `res[-1]` which is `a / 2`, `res` is either `[a / 2, a / 3]` if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, `[a / 3]` if `a % 3 == 0` and `a / 3` is in `arr`, or `[a * 2]` if `a * 2` is in `arr`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` does not contain `a / 3` or `a * 2`, `sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`***
