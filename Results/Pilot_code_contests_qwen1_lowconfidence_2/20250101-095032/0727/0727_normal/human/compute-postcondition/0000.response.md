The given code snippet does not perform any operations on variables or lists, but rather defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. Since no variables or lists are manipulated, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is in the range 1 to 3 ⋅ 10^{18}, and these numbers can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number; `MOD` is 10 ** 9 + 7.**
