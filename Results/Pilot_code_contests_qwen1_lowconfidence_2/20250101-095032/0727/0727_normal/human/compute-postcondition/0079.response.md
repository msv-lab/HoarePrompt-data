The code `continue` is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The only information we know from the initial state is that `arr` does not contain `a / 3`, and `res` is the list formed by the previous definition of `res` plus the element `a / 3`. The `continue` statement does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`arr` does not contain `a / 3`, `res` is the list formed by the previous definition of `res` plus the element `a / 3`.**
