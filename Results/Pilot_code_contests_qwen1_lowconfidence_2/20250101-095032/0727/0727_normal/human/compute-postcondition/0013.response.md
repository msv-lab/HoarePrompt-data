The code defines a lambda function `read_int` that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`. This does not execute the function but rather creates it. The existing values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`**
