The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if inside a loop) and moves on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the only impact is that the current operation (which was not defined) is skipped. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `res[0]`, `arr` contains `a / 2`, `res` is `[a * 3, a]`**
