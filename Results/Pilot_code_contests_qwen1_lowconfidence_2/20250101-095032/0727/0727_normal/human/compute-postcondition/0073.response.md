The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Given the initial state, the only variable affected is `arr`, which does not contain `specific_a * 3`. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `a`, `res`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` does not contain `specific_a * 3`, `a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is `[a * 3] + res`**
