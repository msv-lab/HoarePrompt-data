The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop present in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program. The variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` does not contain `a / 2`, `res` is `[a / 2]`, `a` is an even integer such that `a / 2` was originally in `arr`.**
