The given code registers a function using `atexit.register`. This function writes the contents of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` when the program exits. However, this does not affect the current state of variables. The values of `n`, the list of integers, `MOD`, `INF`, and `sys.subversion[0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is in the range 1 to 3 ⋅ 10^{18}, and these numbers can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is set to positive infinity; `sys.subversion[0]` equals 'PyPy'; `sys.stdout` is set to an in-memory bytes buffer.**
