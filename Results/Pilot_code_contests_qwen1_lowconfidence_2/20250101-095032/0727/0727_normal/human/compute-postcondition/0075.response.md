Postcondition: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is equal to `res[0]`. If `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`. If the above condition is false, then `arr` does not contain `a * 3`, `res` is `[a * 3] + res`, and `a` remains unchanged.**
