The code `res = [arr.pop()]` pops the last element from the list `arr` and assigns it to the list `res`. Initially, `arr` is a list of integers determined by the input, and `res` does not exist. After executing the code, `res` will contain the last element of `arr`, and `arr` will lose its last element.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` is a list of integers determined by the input with the last element removed, `res` is a list containing the last element of `arr`.**
