Postcondition: ***`a` is `res[-1]`, and the state of `res` depends on the presence of `a * 2` in `arr`. If `a * 2` is in `arr`, then `res` is `[res[0], res[1], ..., res[-2], a * 2]`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as per the precondition: if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is not in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[a / 2] + res`; if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `res` is updated to `[a * 3, a]` if `a * 3` is in `arr`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.***
