`res` is updated by appending `a * 2` to the list. Based on the initial state, `a % 2 == 0` is true, and `a / 2` is in `arr`. Therefore, `arr` will no longer contain the element equal to `res[0] / 2`, and `res` will be updated to `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`. Since `res[0]` is now `a * 2`, `res[0] / 2` is `a`. 

Given the conditions, `arr` will no longer contain `a`, and `res` will become `[a] + initial_res[1:]`.

Output State: **`arr` does not contain `a * 2`; `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `a`, and `res` is `[a] + initial_res[1:]`**
