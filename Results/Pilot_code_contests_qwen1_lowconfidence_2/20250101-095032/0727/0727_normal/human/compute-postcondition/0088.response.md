Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of `n` integer numbers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each number is in the range 1 to \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\). It rearranges the numbers such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number. The function constructs a sequence of operations that can transform the initial elements of the list into a valid sequence according to the specified rules. After executing the operations, the function prints the resulting sequence and returns nothing. If no valid sequence can be constructed, the function still prints the initial sequence provided.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input list cannot be rearranged to satisfy the condition that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number, the function will print the initial list as the result. This covers the case where the input list does not have a valid sequence of operations.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not return a boolean value indicating whether a valid sequence can be constructed. Instead, it prints the sequence and returns nothing. Therefore, the function does not explicitly return a boolean value as suggested in the provided annotations.
