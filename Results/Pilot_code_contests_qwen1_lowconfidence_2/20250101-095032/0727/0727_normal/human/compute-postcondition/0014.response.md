The code defines a new lambda function `read_ints` which maps integers to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input using `split()`. This does not assign a specific value to any variable but rather creates a new function. Therefore, the existing variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, and `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`.**
