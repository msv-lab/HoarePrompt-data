The given lambda function `pr` simply writes a space-separated string of its arguments to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline. This does not change any of the values of the variables, but it does affect the state of `sys.stdout`. The initial state of `sys.stdout` is set to an in-memory bytes buffer, and the `pr` function will write to this buffer.

The output of the `pr` function itself is not stored anywhere in the state, but it modifies `sys.stdout`. Since no values are directly assigned or calculated, the only change is in the state of `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity.**
