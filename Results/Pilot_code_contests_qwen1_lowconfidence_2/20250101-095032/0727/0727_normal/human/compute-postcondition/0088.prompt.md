You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is in the range 1 to 3 ⋅ 10^{18}, and these numbers can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number.
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    INF = float('+inf')
    if (sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy') :
        sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
        atexit.register(lambda : sys.__stdout__.write(sys.stdout.getvalue()))

Additionally, if `sys.subversion[0]` equals 'PyPy', then `sys.stdin` is an in-memory bytes buffer containing the original input data, `sys.stdout` is set to an in-memory bytes buffer, and `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the trailing newline character. Otherwise, the state of `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `raw_input` remains unchanged.
    pr = lambda *args: sys.stdout.write(' '.join(str(x) for x in args) + '\n')

            arr.remove(a / 3)
            res = res + [a / 3]
            continue
        elif a * 2 in arr:
            arr.remove(a * 2)

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is empty, `res` contains the sequence of operations applied to the initial elements of `arr` until no further operations can be performed, `a` is the last element of `res`, `sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`

#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of `n` integer numbers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each number is in the range 1 to \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\). The numbers in the list can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number.
#
#Case_1: The list meets the criteria described above, the function returns `True`.
#Case_2: The list does not meet the criteria described above, the function returns `False`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers and return `True` if the numbers in the list can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
