The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the execution of `continue` does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is `res[-1]` which is `a / 2`, `res` contains `[a * 2]` since `a * 2` was added to it, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` does not contain `a * 2`, `sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `a % 3 != 0` or `a / 3` is not in `arr`.**
