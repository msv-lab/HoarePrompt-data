The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given context, the `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables. The variables `a`, `arr`, and `res` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is `res[-1]`, `arr` contains `a / 2`, `res` is `[res[0], res[1], ..., res[-2], a * 2]`**
