The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect. The variables `sys.stdout`, `MOD`, `INF`, `read_strs`, `read_int`, `read_ints`, `read_float`, `read_floats`, `n`, `arr`, and `res` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` is a non-empty set containing unique elements of the original list excluding `a * 3`, `res` is `[a * 3]`, `a` is undefined.**
