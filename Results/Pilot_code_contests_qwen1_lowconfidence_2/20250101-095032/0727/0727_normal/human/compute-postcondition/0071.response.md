`a` is equal to `res[0]`, which means `a` has a specific value from the list `res`. The code removes `a * 3` from `arr`. Since `a` is known but its specific value is not given, the output will include both `a` and `arr` after the removal operation. The precondition that `arr` must not be empty still holds.

Let's denote the specific value of `a` as `specific_a`. Then `a * 3` is removed from `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` does not contain `specific_a * 3`, `a` is equal to `res[0]`**
