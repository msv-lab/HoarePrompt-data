The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and proceed with the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect, and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `res[0] / 2`, `arr` does not contain `a / 2`, `res` is `[a / 2] + res`**
