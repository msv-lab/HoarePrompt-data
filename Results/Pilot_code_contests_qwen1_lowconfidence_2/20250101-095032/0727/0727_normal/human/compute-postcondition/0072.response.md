`res` is updated by appending `a * 3` to the beginning of the list, and `a` remains unchanged. The initial state indicates that `arr` does not contain `specific_a * 3`, and `a` is equal to `res[0]`. After executing the code, `res` will be `[a * 3] + res`, which means the first element of `res` will be `a * 3`. The value of `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` does not contain `specific_a * 3`, `a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is `[a * 3] + res`**
