`a` is equal to `res[0]`, which means `a` has a specific value from the list `res`. The value of `a` is divided by 2, and then the result is used to remove an element from `arr`. However, since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact element that will be removed from `arr`. We know that `arr` must not be empty, so there is at least one element in `arr`.

After the code executes, the value of `a` remains unchanged because the division operation is only used in the `remove` method and does not assign a new value to `a`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, `a` is equal to `res[0]`**
