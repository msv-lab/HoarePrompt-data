`arr.remove(a * 2)` removes the value `a * 2` from the set `arr`. Since `a * 2` was in `arr` (as per the initial state), this operation successfully removes it. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`a` is `res[-1]` which is `a / 2`, `res` is either `[a / 2]` if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, otherwise it is either `[a * 3]` if `a * 3` is in `arr` or remains unchanged, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` does not contain `a * 2`, `sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`. Additionally, `a % 3 != 0` or `a / 3` is not in `arr`. The current value of `a` is such that `a * 2` is in `arr` is no longer true since `a * 2` has been removed from `arr`.
