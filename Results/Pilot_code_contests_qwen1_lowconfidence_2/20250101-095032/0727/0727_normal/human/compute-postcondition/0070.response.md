The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and no variables are being directly modified by this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, `a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]**
