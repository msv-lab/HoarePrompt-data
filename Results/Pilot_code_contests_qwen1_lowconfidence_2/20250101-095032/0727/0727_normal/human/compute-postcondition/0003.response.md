The code `sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()` changes the standard output of the program to an in-memory bytes buffer, which does not affect the integer list, `MOD`, `INF`, or `sys.subversion[0]`. Therefore, the only change is in the standard output handling.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is in the range 1 to 3 ⋅ 10^{18}, and these numbers can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number; `MOD` is 10; `INF` is set to positive infinity; `sys.subversion[0]` equals 'PyPy'; `sys.stdout` is set to an in-memory bytes buffer.**
