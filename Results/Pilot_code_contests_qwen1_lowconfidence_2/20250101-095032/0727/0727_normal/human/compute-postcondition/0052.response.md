`a` is initially `res[0]`, and `arr` contains `a / 2`. The code removes `a * 3` from `arr`. Since `a` is `res[0]`, `a * 3` is `res[0] * 3`. However, `arr` only contains `a / 2`, which means `a / 2` is in `arr`. The value `res[0] * 3` does not match `a / 2`, so it cannot be found in `arr` and thus cannot be removed. Therefore, `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `res[0]`, `arr` must contain `a / 2`**
