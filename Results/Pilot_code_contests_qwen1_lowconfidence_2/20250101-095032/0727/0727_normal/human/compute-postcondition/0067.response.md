`a` is assigned the value of `res[0]`. Since `arr` must not be empty, `res` is assumed to be a list or an array that is not empty, and `res[0]` refers to the first element in `res`. The value of `a` is set to this first element. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` must not be empty; `a` is equal to `res[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `a` is equal to `res[0]`**
