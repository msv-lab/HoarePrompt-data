Postcondition: ***`arr` must not be empty; `a` is the last element of `res`. If `a * 2` is not in `arr`, then `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `a`, and `res` is `[a] + initial_res[1:]`. Otherwise, `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `a / 2`, and `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`.***
