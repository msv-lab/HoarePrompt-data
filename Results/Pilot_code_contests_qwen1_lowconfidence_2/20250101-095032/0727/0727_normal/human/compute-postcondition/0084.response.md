Postcondition: ***`arr` must not be empty; `a` is the last element of `res`. If `a % 3 == 0` and `a / 3` is in `arr`, then `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, and `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`. Otherwise, `arr` either does not contain `a * 3`, in which case `res` is `[a * 3] + res`, or it contains all elements except the one equal to `a` (if `a * 2` is not in `arr`) or the one equal to `a / 2` (if `a * 2` is in `arr`), and `res` is `[a] + initial_res[1:]` or `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]` accordingly.***
