The code `res = [a / 2] + res` impacts the variable `res`. Initially, `a` is equal to `res[0]`. The value of `a` is known and can be used directly in the calculation. The first element of `res` is replaced by `a / 2`, and then the rest of the list remains unchanged.

Given that `a` is equal to `res[0]`, the new first element of `res` will be `res[0] / 2`. All other elements of `res` remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, `a` is equal to `res[0]`, `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]**
