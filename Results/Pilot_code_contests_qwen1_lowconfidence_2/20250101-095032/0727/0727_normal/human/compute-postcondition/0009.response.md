The provided code defines a lambda function `epr` which writes formatted strings to `sys.stderr`. This does not change the values of the existing variables `sys.stdout`, `MOD`, and `INF`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity**
