`arr` is assigned the value returned by `read_ints()`, which reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the states of other variables such as `sys.stdout`, `MOD`, `INF`, `read_strs`, `read_int`, `read_ints`, `read_float`, and `read_floats` are also unaffected.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` is a list of integers determined by the input.**
