The code `arr.remove(a * 2)` attempts to remove the element `a * 2` from the list `arr`. However, based on the initial state, `arr` must contain `a / 2`, not `a * 2`. Therefore, the removal operation will fail because `a * 2` is not in `arr`.

Given this, no changes occur to the variables `a`, `arr`, or `res`. The only change would be that the attempt to remove `a * 2` from `arr` fails, but since no variables are actually modified, we do not need to reflect this failure in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is `res[-1]`, `arr` must contain `a / 2`, and `res` remains unchanged**.
