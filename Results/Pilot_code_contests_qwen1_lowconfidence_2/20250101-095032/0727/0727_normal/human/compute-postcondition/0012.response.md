The code defines a lambda function `read_strs` that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings. This does not affect the values of the existing variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, the program is terminated.**
