The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is `res[-1]` which is `a / 2`, `res` is either `[a / 2, a / 3]` if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, otherwise it is either `[a * 3, a / 3]` if `a * 3` is in `arr` or `[a / 3]` if none of the above conditions are met, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` does not contain `a / 3`, `sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`**
