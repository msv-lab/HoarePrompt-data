The code snippet `arr = set(arr)` converts the list `arr` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements. Since the initial state of `arr` is a list of integers with the last element removed, converting it to a set will remove any duplicates.

Let's assume the initial list `arr` contains the following elements (example values):
- Initial `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`

After converting `arr` to a set, the resulting set will be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. Note that the last element of `arr` before conversion is still the same as the last element after conversion because the last element was already in the set.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `sys.stdout` remains an in-memory bytes buffer
- `MOD` remains 10
- `INF` remains positive infinity
- `read_strs` remains a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings
- `read_int` remains a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`
- `read_ints` remains a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`
- `read_float` remains a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`
- `read_floats` remains a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`
- `n` remains an integer determined by the input
- `res` remains a list containing the last element of `arr`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` is a set containing unique elements of the original list, `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`.**
