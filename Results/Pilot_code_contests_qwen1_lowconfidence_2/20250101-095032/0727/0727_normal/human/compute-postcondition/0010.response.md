The provided code defines a lambda function named `die`. This lambda function takes any number of arguments (`*args`), and within the lambda, `pr(*args)` is called, followed by `exit(0)`. The `exit(0)` function terminates the program immediately. 

Given this behavior, when the `die` function is called, it will attempt to execute `pr(*args)`, but since the program is terminated immediately afterward, no further operations can occur, and no output will be produced. 

Therefore, the initial state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program execution is terminated.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, the program is terminated.**
