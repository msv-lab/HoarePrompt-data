The code appends `a / 2` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` is undefined, and `a / 2` is in `arr`. Since `a` is an even integer and `a / 2` was originally in `arr`, `a / 2` is now added to `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `res` is now `[a / 2]`.
- `arr` does not contain `a / 2`.

Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` does not contain `a / 2`, `res` is `[a / 2]`, `a` is an even integer such that `a / 2` was originally in `arr`.**
