`res` is updated to include `a / 2` as its first element, and the rest of `res` remains the same. The value of `a` is `res[0]`, which means `a` is the first element of `res`. After adding `a / 2` to `res`, `arr` still does not contain `a / 2`.

Output State: **`a` is `res[0] / 2`, `arr` does not contain `a / 2`, `res` is `[a / 2] + res`**
