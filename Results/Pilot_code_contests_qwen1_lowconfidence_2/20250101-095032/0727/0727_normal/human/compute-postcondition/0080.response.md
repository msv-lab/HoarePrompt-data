The code `arr.remove(a * 2)` removes the element `a * 2` from the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions:

- `arr` must not be empty.
- `a` is the last element of `res`.
- If the condition `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr` is true, then `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, and `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`.
- Otherwise, `arr` does not contain `a * 3`, and `res` is `[a * 3] + res`.

We need to consider both scenarios:

1. If `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`:
   - `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`.
   - `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`.

2. Otherwise:
   - `arr` does not contain `a * 3`.
   - `res` is `[a * 3] + res`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, let's denote it as `a`. We know that `a` is the last element of `res`.

Let's analyze both cases:

### Case 1: `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`
- Remove `a * 2` from `arr`.
- `arr` now contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`.
- `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`.

### Case 2: `a % 2 != 0` or `a / 2` is not in `arr`
- Remove `a * 2` from `arr`.
- `arr` does not contain `a * 3`.
- `res` is `[a * 3] + res`.

In both cases, `a * 2` is removed from `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` does not contain `a * 2`; if `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `arr` contains all elements except the one equal to `res[0] / 2`, and `res` is `[res[0] / 2] + initial_res[1:]`; otherwise, `arr` does not contain `a * 3`, and `res` is `[a * 3] + res`.**
