You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state right before the loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one time, please simply repeat the program state right before the loop. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` beinng an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, students is 2 less than its initial value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State right before the while loop: `sys.stdout` is an in-memory bytes buffer, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is positive infinity, `read_strs` is a lambda function that takes input using `raw_input()` and splits it into a list of strings, `read_int` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input using `int(raw_input())`, `read_ints` is a lambda function that reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, `read_float` is a lambda function that reads a float from input using `float(raw_input())`, `read_floats` is a lambda function that maps `float` to each element of the list split from the input using `raw_input().split()`, `n` is an integer determined by the input, `arr` is a set containing unique elements of the original list, `res` is a list containing the last element of the original `arr`.
```
while arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
