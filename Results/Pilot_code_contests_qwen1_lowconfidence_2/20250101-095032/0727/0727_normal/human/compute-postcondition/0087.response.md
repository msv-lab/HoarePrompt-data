The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of `n` integer numbers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each number is in the range 1 to \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\). The numbers in the list can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number.

Case_1: The list meets the criteria described above, the function returns `True`.
Case_2: The list does not meet the criteria described above, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers and return `True` if the numbers in the list can be rearranged such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number; otherwise, it returns `False`.
