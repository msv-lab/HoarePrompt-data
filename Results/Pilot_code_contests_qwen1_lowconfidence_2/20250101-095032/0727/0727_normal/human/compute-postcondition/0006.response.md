The code defines a lambda function `raw_input` which is assigned to read a line from `sys.stdin` and strip the trailing newline character. However, this does not change the actual content of `sys.stdin` or perform any input operation. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sys.stdin` is an in-memory bytes buffer containing the original input data, `MOD` is 10, `INF` is set to positive infinity, `sys.subversion[0]` equals 'PyPy', `sys.stdout` is set to an-in-memory bytes buffer, `raw_input` is a lambda function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the trailing newline character.**
