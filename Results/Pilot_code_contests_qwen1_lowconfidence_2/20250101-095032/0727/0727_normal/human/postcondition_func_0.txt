The function `func` accepts a list of `n` integer numbers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each number is in the range 1 to \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\). It rearranges the numbers such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number. The function constructs a sequence of operations that can transform the initial elements of the list into a valid sequence according to the specified rules. After executing the operations, the function prints the resulting sequence and returns nothing. If no valid sequence can be constructed, the function still prints the initial sequence provided.
