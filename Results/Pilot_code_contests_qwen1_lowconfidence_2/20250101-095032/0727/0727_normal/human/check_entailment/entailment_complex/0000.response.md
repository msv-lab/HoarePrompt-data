Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to rearrange the sequence according to the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Rearrangement**:
   - The program attempts to find and append either `a / 2` or `a * 3` to the result list `res`, and similarly for `a / 3` or `a * 2`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the final sequence will meet the requirement that each subsequent number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number.
   - The program only checks if `a / 2` or `a * 3` exists in the set `arr`, and does not ensure that the sequence forms a valid chain of transformations from the starting number to the end.

2. **Missing Initial Starting Point**:
   - The program starts with an arbitrary number from `arr` and attempts to build the sequence backward, which may not necessarily lead to a valid sequence. It should start with the smallest number that can serve as the initial value `x` and build the sequence forward.

3. **No Validity Check**:
   - There is no explicit check to ensure that the rearranged sequence is valid. Even though it is guaranteed that a valid sequence exists, the implementation does not verify the validity of the generated sequence.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the smallest number in the input sequence, which can serve as the starting point `x`.
- Use a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences that can be formed by repeatedly applying the operations `x / 3` and `x * 2`.
- Ensure that the sequence generated is valid by checking that each number in the sequence is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set(map(int, input().split()))))
    
    def dfs(path):
        if len(path) == n:
            print(' '.join(map(str, path)))
            return True
        last = path[-1] if path else min(arr)
        for num in [last * 2, last // 3]:
            if num in arr:
                arr.remove(num)
                if dfs(path + [num]):
                    return True
                arr.add(num)
        return False
    
    dfs([min(arr)])
```

This corrected version ensures that the sequence is built correctly and verifies its validity.
