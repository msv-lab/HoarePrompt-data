You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp likes to play with numbers. He takes some integer number x, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it n - 1 operations of the two kinds: 

  * divide the number x by 3 (x must be divisible by 3); 
  * multiply the number x by 2. 



After each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces x by the result. So there will be n numbers on the board after all.

You are given a sequence of length n — the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.

Your problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of previous number.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Input

The first line of the input contatins an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the elements in the sequence. The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}) — rearranged (reordered) sequence that Polycarp can wrote down on the board.

Output

Print n integer numbers — rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Polycarp could write down on the board.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Examples

Input

4 8 6 3 12 9


Output

9 3 6 12 4 8 


Input

4
42 28 84 126

Input

2

Output

3000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 

Note

In the first example the given sequence can be rearranged in the following way: [9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]. It can match possible Polycarp's game which started with x = 9.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle sequences where the starting number is larger than the final number and requires multiple steps to reach it through division by 3.

For example, consider the input sequence `[27, 9, 18]`. According to the problem description, the sequence should be rearranged such that each number is either double or one-third of the previous number. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program starts with `n = 3` and the sequence `[27, 9, 18]`.
2. **First Iteration**: The program picks `27` as the starting point. Since `27` is not divisible by 2, it checks if `27 * 3` is in the remaining set. It finds `81` is not in the set, so it tries `27 / 3 = 9`. It removes `9` from the set and adds `9` to the result list.
3. **Second Iteration**: Now, the set contains `[18]`, and the result list is `[9]`. The program picks `9` as the next starting point. Since `9` is not divisible by 2, it checks if `9 * 3 = 27` is in the set. It finds `27` is in the set, so it removes `27` from the set and adds `27` to the result list.
4. **Final Result**: The resulting list is `[9, 27]`, which is incorrect because it should be `[9, 18, 27]`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles sequences where the starting number is larger than the final number and requires multiple steps to reach it through division by 3. A more robust approach would involve a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible paths to construct the valid sequence.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts a list of `n` integer numbers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each number is in the range 1 to \(3 \cdot 10^{18}\). It rearranges the numbers such that each number is either exactly two times the previous number or exactly one third of the previous number. The function constructs a sequence of operations that can transform the initial elements of the list into a valid sequence according to the specified rules. After executing the operations, the function prints the resulting sequence and returns nothing. If no valid sequence can be constructed, the function still prints the initial sequence provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
