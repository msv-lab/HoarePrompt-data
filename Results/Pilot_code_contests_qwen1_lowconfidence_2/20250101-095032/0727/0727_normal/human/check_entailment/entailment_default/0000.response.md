Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that the sequence can be rearranged to match the rules described. The code attempts to build the sequence by repeatedly checking if the current element is part of a valid operation (either multiplying by 2 or dividing by 3), but it does not ensure that all elements can be placed in the correct order.

For example, consider the input sequence: `[4, 8, 6, 3, 12, 9]`. The correct rearrangement would be `[9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]`, as demonstrated in the example answer. However, the provided code might not be able to place the element `9` correctly because it tries to place elements based on their immediate neighbors rather than considering the entire sequence.

The code has the following issues:
1. It does not handle cases where the sequence cannot be rearranged correctly.
2. It relies on the sequence being built from the first element, which may not always be the correct starting point.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
