Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find a root vertex in a tree that satisfies the given conditions. Here's why the program follows the problem description:

1. **Tree Representation**: The program correctly constructs the tree from the input. It reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges connecting these vertices, storing them in an adjacency list representation `e`.

2. **Finding a Suitable Root**:
   - The program performs two breadth-first searches (BFS) to calculate the shortest path distances from two different starting points (`1` and the last node processed in the second BFS).
   - It then checks whether the tree has a root that satisfies the condition: for all vertices `v_1` and `v_2` at the same distance from the root, their degrees must be equal.
   - If such a root is found, the program prints it and exits.

3. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to verify the degrees at each level of the tree. It iterates over the nodes and checks if the degrees match the expected values based on the distances from the root.
   - If a suitable root is found, the program ensures that all nodes at the same distance from the root have the same degree.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no such root exists by printing `-1`.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic to find a suitable root and verify the conditions is sound. The program checks for the necessary properties and handles both the existence and non-existence of such a root correctly.

Given the problem description and the provided annotations, the program correctly implements the required logic to find a suitable root vertex in the tree. Therefore, the program is correct.
