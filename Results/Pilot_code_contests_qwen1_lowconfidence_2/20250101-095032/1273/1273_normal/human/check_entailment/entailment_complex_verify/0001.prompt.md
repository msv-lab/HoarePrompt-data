You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have given tree consist of n vertices. Select a vertex as root vertex that satisfies the condition below.

  * For all vertices v_{1} and v_{2}, if distance(root, v_{1}) = distance(root, v_{2}) then degree(v_{1}) = degree(v_{2}), where degree means the number of vertices connected to that vertex, and distance means the number of edges between two vertices. 



Determine and find if there is such root vertex in the tree. If there are multiple answers, find any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of vertices.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i} < u_{i} ≤ n) — it means there is an edge exist between v_{i} and u_{i}. It is guaranteed that the graph forms tree.

Output

If there is such root vertex exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print -1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a root vertex in a tree that satisfies the given condition. However, there are several issues in the logic that prevent it from correctly identifying the root vertex for all possible cases:

1. **Depth Calculation and Degree Check**: The program calculates the depth of each node and checks the degrees at each level. However, it only performs this check once, which might miss certain configurations where the condition fails after deeper exploration.

2. **Center Calculation**: The center calculation (`center = end`) might not always be correct. In some cases, the center might not be the best candidate for satisfying the condition, especially when the tree has a specific structure.

3. **Top Node Identification**: The identification of the top node (`top = center`) might not be optimal. The program should consider other nodes that might satisfy the condition better, especially in trees with complex structures.

4. **Final Degree Check**: The final degree check might not cover all necessary cases. The program should ensure that the chosen root vertex satisfies the condition for all pairs of vertices at the same distance.

To illustrate a case where the program might fail, consider the following input:

```
5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

In this tree, any vertex can be a valid root since the distances and degrees are consistent. However, the program might not correctly identify any of these vertices due to the issues mentioned above.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to a verdict of `False`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Specifically, for each level in the tree, the number of children of a node should match the degree of that level. If no such node exists, the function prints -1.
