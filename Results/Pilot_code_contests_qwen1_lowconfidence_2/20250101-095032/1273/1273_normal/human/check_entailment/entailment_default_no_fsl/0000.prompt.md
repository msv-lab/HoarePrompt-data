You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have given tree consist of n vertices. Select a vertex as root vertex that satisfies the condition below.

  * For all vertices v_{1} and v_{2}, if distance(root, v_{1}) = distance(root, v_{2}) then degree(v_{1}) = degree(v_{2}), where degree means the number of vertices connected to that vertex, and distance means the number of edges between two vertices. 



Determine and find if there is such root vertex in the tree. If there are multiple answers, find any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of vertices.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i} < u_{i} ≤ n) — it means there is an edge exist between v_{i} and u_{i}. It is guaranteed that the graph forms tree.

Output

If there is such root vertex exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print -1.

Examples

This is the picture for the second example. You can see that it's impossible to find such root vertex.

Output hints: The function processes a tree structure defined by \( n \) nodes and \( n-1 \) edges. It aims to find a "good" central node in the tree. A node is considered "good" if it satisfies certain conditions related to the degrees of its children. Specifically, for each level in the tree, the number of children of a node should match the degree of that level. If no such node exists, the function prints -1.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
