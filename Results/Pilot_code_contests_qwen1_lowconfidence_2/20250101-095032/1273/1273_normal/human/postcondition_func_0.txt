The function processes a tree structure defined by \( n \) nodes and \( n-1 \) edges. It aims to find a "good" central node in the tree. A node is considered "good" if it satisfies certain conditions related to the degrees of its children. Specifically, for each level in the tree, the number of children of a node should match the degree of that level. If no such node exists, the function prints -1.
