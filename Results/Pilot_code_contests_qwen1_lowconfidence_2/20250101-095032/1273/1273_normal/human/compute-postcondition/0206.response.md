`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. According to the initial state, `dep[cur]` is equal to `dep[end] - number_of_iterations` because `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`. Also, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.

Since `dep[to]` was initially set to `-1`, it is now updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes, `e[cur]` must be non-empty, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
