`q` is cleared using the `clear()` method, which removes all elements from the list. The value of `cur` remains the second element of `q` after removing its first element, but since `q` is now empty, `cur` no longer refers to a valid element in `q`. The value of `e[cur]` is no longer relevant since `q` is empty. The value of `top` is still equal to `to`, but since `q` is now empty, `top` does not refer to a valid element in `q`.

Output State: **`cur` is no longer valid, `e[cur]` is no longer valid, `q` is now an empty list, `top` is equal to `to`**
