`q` is appended with the value of `to`. The value of `to` exists within `e[cur]` and satisfies the condition `len(e[to]) != 1`. The value of `dep[to]` remains unchanged and is set to `dep[cur] + 1`. The state of other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and there must exist at least one `to` in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[to]) != 1`; `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; `q` contains an additional element `to`**
