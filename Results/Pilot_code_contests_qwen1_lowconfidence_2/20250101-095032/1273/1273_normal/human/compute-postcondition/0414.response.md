The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `q` is initially `[to, new_to]`. After appending `to` to `q`, the list `q` will become `[to, new_to, to]`.

Other variables remain unchanged in their initial states. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `deg` remains as `[-1] * (n + 1)`
- `cur` remains as the first element of `q`
- `q` changes to `[to, new_to, to]`
- `dep` remains as the depth of each node from the root with `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`
- `top` remains the same as `dep`
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `bad` remains `False`
- `dep[new_to]` remains `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[new_to] == -1`

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is `[to, new_to, to]`, `dep` is the depth of each node from the root with `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same as `dep`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[new_to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[new_to] == -1`.**
