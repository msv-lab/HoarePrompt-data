`u` and `v` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `raw_input()` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `e` is still a list containing `n + 1` empty lists.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists, `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input.**
