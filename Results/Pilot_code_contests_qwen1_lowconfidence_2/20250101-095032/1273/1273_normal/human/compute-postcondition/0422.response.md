The code snippet appends the value `to` to the list `q`. Let's analyze the impact on each variable:

- `deg` remains unchanged as there is no operation that affects this variable.
- `cur` remains unchanged as there is no operation that affects this variable.
- `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, making the new state `q` is `q` with `to` appended to it.
- `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `top` remains unchanged as there is no operation that affects this variable.
- `n` remains unchanged as there is no operation that affects this variable.
- `bad` remains unchanged as there is no operation that affects this variable.
- `dep[cur]` remains unchanged as there is no operation that affects this variable.

Therefore, the updated states are as follows:
- `deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\)
- `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`
- `q` is `q` with `to` appended to it
- `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`
- `top` is the same
- `n` is a positive integer
- `bad` is `False`
- `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` with `to` appended to it, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root.**
