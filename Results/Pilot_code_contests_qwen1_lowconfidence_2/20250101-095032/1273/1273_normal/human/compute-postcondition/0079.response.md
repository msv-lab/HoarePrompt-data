`q` is a deque that is initially empty. The code appends `to` to `q`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes `q` containing the element `to`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`, `q` contains `to`, `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, `e[end]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is `1`; `pred[to]` is `end`.**
