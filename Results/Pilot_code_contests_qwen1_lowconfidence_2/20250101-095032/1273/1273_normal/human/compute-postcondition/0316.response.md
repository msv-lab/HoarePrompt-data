Postcondition: **`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `to` is appended to `q` and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`. If `len(e[to]) != 2`, then `top` is equal to `to`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, `q` becomes an empty list and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially described.**
