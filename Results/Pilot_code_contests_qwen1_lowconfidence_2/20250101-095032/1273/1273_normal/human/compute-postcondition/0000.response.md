The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the input is read from the user, the exact value of `n` is not known in this context. However, we know from the initial state that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

After executing this line of code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, but the exact value is unknown. All other information about the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, and the precondition that `1 \leq n \leq 10^5` still holds.**
