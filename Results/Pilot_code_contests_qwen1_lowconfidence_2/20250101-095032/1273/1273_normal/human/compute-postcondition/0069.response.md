The code initializes a list `pred` of length `n + 1` where each element is set to `0`. The values of `q`, `cur`, and `dep` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`q` is empty, `cur` is the last element processed, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `-1`, `pred` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `0`.**
