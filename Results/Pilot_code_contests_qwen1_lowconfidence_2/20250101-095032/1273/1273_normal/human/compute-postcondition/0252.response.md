`cur` is assigned the value returned by `q.popleft()`. Since `q` is a deque containing `center`, `cur` will be assigned the value `center`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements except the element at index `center` being -1 and the element at index `center` being 0; `i` is `n+1`; `n` is a positive integer; `bad` remains unchanged; `top` is `center`; `q` is a deque containing no elements; `cur` is `center`.**
