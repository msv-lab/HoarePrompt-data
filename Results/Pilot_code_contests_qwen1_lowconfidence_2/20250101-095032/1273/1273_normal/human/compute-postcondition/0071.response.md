The code initializes a queue `q` with the value of `cur`. This means that `cur` is added to the queue. The length of `dep` remains unchanged, and `dep[cur]` is still `0`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`; `q` is a deque containing `[cur]`; `cur` is the last element processed**
