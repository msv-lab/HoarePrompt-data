The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`. Given the initial state, `deg[dep[i]]` was `-1` and now it is updated to `len(e[i])`.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1` except for `deg[dep[i]]` which is now `len(e[i])`, `bad` is `False`, and `n` must be greater than 0**
