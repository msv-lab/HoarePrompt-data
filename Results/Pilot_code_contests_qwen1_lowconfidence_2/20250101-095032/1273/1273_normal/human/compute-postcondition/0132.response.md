The variable `bad` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `bad` and retains the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length n+1 with all elements initialized to -1, `bad` is `False`**
