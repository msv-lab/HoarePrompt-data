Postcondition: ***`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `cur` is `center`. If `dep[to]` equals -1, then:
- If `len(e[to])` is 2, `dep[to]` is set to `d_center + 1`.
- If `len(e[to])` is 1, `top` is equal to `to`, `q` is now empty, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- If `len(e[to])` is not 1, the conditions remain unchanged as they were before the if-else block.***
