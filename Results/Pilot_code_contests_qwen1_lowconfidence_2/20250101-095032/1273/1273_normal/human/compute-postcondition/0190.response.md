`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the shortest distance from the starting node to node `to` is updated to be one more than the shortest distance from the starting node to node `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is updated to represent the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element, `e[cur]` must have been processed for all nodes reachable from `cur`, `q` is the deque with its first element removed, and `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
