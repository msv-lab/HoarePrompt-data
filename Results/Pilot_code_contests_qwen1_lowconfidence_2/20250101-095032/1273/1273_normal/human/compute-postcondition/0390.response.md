The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. According to the initial state, `q` is an empty list. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `q` will contain the single element `to`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is `top`, `q` is `[to]`, `dep` is \([0, -1, -1, ..., -1]\) with `dep[top]` set to 0 and `dep[to]` set to 1, `top` is a valid last leaf node, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
