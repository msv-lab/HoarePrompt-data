The `break` statement does not affect any variable values but rather exits the loop or block it is inside. Since no such loop or block context is provided, the variables remain unchanged. The Output State should reflect that the `break` statement was executed, but the values of the other variables stay as they were.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where `deg[dep[i]]` is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])`, `bad` is `True`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
