The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This means that `to` is added to the end of the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1`, `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`, `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, and for any unprocessed neighbor `to` of `end`, `dep[to]` is now `2` or `3`; `pred[to]` is equal to `cur`; `q` is a list with the additional element `to` appended to it.**
