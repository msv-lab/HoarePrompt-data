The code `pred[to] = end` assigns the value of `end` to the variable `pred[to]`. Here, `end` is equal to `cur`, and no other variables are affected. The output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, `e[end]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is `1`; `pred[to]` is `end`.**
