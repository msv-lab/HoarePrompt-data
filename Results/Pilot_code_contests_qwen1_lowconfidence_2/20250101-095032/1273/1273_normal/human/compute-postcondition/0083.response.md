The code assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. Given that `end` is equal to `cur`, the value of `pred[to]` will be updated to `cur`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`; `dep[to]` is `1` or `2`; `cur` is the last element processed; `end` is equal to `cur`; `pred[to]` is equal to `cur`.**
