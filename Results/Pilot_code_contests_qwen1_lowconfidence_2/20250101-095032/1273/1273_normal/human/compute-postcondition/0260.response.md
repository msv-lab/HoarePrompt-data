`top` is assigned the value of `to`. The value of `cur` is still `center`, the value of `dep[to]` remains -1, and `len(e[to])` is still equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `cur` is `center`, and the current value of `dep[to]` is -1, and `len(e[to])` is equal to 1; `top` is equal to `to`.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `cur` is `center`, and the current value of `dep[to]` is -1, and `len(e[to])` is equal to 1; `top` is equal to `to`**
