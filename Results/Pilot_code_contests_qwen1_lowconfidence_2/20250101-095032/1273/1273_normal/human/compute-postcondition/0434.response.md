The code initializes the variable `deg` to be a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`. This means the previous value of `deg` is overwritten. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is the last node processed in the DFS traversal, `q` is an empty deque, `dep` contains the depth of each node from the root `top`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`**
