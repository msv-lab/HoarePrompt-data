Postcondition: ***`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])` based on the condition `deg[dep[i]] != -1`, `bad` is `False`, and `cur` is printed.***
