Let's break down the given scenario step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the shortest path distance from the starting node `cur` or `end`.
- `pred` is a list indicating the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree.
- `q` contains at least one less element than before (the leftmost element is removed).
- `cur` is the last node processed.
- `end` is the node that was at the front of the queue `q` before it was removed.

### For Loop:
```
for to in e[end]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `e`:**
   - The loop iterates over the neighbors of the node `end` stored in the list `e[end]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `e[end]` must contain at least one element.

2. **Variables:**
   - `end` is the node that was at the front of the queue `q` before it was removed. This means that `end` is still a valid node in the graph, and its neighbors (`e[end]`) should be checked.
   - `e` is a dictionary-like structure where `e[node]` gives the list of neighbors of `node`.

3. **Queue `q`:**
   - The variable `q` contains at least one less element than before, meaning a node (possibly `end`) has been processed and removed from `q`.
   - Since `end` was at the front of `q` before it was removed, it must still be part of the graph, and its neighbors should be checked.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - Ensure that `e[end]` is non-empty. Otherwise, the loop will not execute.
   - No adjustments are needed for `dep`, `pred`, `cur`, or `q` as they do not directly affect the condition of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The key state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `e[end]` is non-empty.

**Final State:**
State: **`e[end]` must be non-empty**
