To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop itself.

### Given Conditions:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the condition for `n` must be checked:
  - If `deg[dep[i]]` is equal to `-1`, then `deg[dep[i]]` is updated to `len(e[i])`.
  - Otherwise, if `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, `n` remains greater than 0 and `bad` is set to `True`.
  - Otherwise, `n` remains greater than 0 and `bad` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Current Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for each `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - The current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration would be `n`.

2. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1` (which would then be out of the loop's bounds).
   - Therefore, the new value of `n` should be `n + 1` for the next iteration to check if `i` is still within the valid range `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Conditions Check for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to ensure that the conditions for `n` are met for `i = n + 1`.
   - Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, we need to reset the condition for `n` to be greater than 0.

### Adjusted States:
- The variable `i` will be incremented to `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- The condition for `n` must be re-evaluated as `n + 1` to check if it is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1** (since `i` starts from 1 and increments to `n + 1`).

So, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**.
