The code `q.append(to)` appends the element `to` to the deque `q`. The initial state includes `q` being a deque with `to` added, `end` being `True`, `e[True]` having at least two elements, `dep[to]` being `1`, and `pred[to]` being `True`. After appending `to` to `q`, the length of `q` increases by one.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least 2 elements (`to` and the previously added element), `end` is `True`, `e[True]` has at least two elements, `dep[to]` is `1`, and `pred[to]` is `True`**
