The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The value of `to` is the state index, which is equal to `dep[end] + 1`. The value of `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, and the value of `dep[end]` remains unspecified. After executing this line of code, the list `q` contains the value of `to`.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`, `to` is a state index, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, the value of `dep[end]` is unspecified, `q` contains `[to]`**
