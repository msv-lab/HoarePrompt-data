The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the end of the list `q`. The variable `to` is added to the list `q`, which was previously described as containing at least two elements, including `cur` and another element (appended in this step).

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1` except `dep[to]` which is now `dep[cur] + 1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is `0`, `cur` is the next element of the deque `q` before it was removed, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, and `q` contains `cur` and `to` appended and now has at least three elements.**
