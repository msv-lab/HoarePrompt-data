`q` is appended with the value of `to`. The value of `end` remains unchanged, `e[True]` (or `e[1]`) is unaffected, `dep[to]` is still 0, and `pred[to]` remains True. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is an empty deque with the element `to` added, `end` is True, `e[True]` (or `e[1]`) has at least one element, `dep[to]` equals 0, `pred[to]` is True.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque with the element `to` added, `end` is True, `e[True]` (or `e[1]`) has at least one element, `dep[to]` equals 0, `pred[to]` is True**
