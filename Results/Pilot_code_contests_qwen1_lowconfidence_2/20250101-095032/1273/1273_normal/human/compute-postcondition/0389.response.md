The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the value of `dep[cur]`. From the initial state, we know that `cur` is `top` and `dep[top]` is set to 0. Therefore, `dep[cur]` is 0. As a result, `dep[to]` will be updated to 1.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state. Thus, the Output State is:

**`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is `top`, `q` is empty, `dep` is \([0, -1, -1, ..., -1]\) with `dep[top]` set to 0 and `dep[to]` set to 1, `top` is a valid last leaf node, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
