`top` is assigned the value of `to`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` must not be -1, is still valid.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` must not be -1; `top` is `to`.**
