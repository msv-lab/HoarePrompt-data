The code sets the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`. Given the initial state where `dep[to]` equals -1, we can determine that `dep[end] + 1` will be -1 + 1, which is 0. Therefore, `dep[to]` is updated to 0.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is True, `e[True]` (or `e[1]`) has at least one element, `dep[to]` equals 0**
