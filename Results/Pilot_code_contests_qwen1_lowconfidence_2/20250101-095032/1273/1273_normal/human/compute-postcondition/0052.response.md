The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes the first element from the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `cur`. However, the initial state does not specify what `q` is. Since `q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue, let's assume `q` is a queue data structure (e.g., a list). After the operation, `q` will have one less element, and `cur` will hold the removed element.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`; `q` is the queue with its first element removed.**
