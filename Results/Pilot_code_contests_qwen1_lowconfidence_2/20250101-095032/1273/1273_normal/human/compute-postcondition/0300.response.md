According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur` and the structure of the list `e[cur]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is the first element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element. If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` (assuming `len(e[to]) == 2`), or the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement (if `len(e[to]) == 1`). Otherwise, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop:

1. **`cur`**: Since `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, and assuming `q` had at least two elements, `cur` will now be the second element of `q` after this removal.
   
2. **`e[cur]`**: For the loop to execute again, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.

3. **`dep[to]`**: The value of `dep[to]` does not affect whether the loop continues, but it is checked inside the loop. After the current iteration, `dep[to]` may have been updated based on the conditions given.

4. **`q`**: After the current iteration, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`. Therefore, `q` will now have one additional element compared to its state before the loop started.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `cur` is the second element of `q` after removing its first element.
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
- `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`.

State: **`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`**
