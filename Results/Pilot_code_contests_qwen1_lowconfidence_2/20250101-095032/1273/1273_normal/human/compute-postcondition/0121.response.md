The code sets `pred[to]` to the value of `end`. Given the initial state, `end` is `True`, and `to` was added to an empty deque `q`, `e[True]` has at least two elements, `dep[to]` is `1`, and `pred[to]` is `True`. After executing the line `pred[to] = end`, the value of `pred[to]` will be updated to `True`.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque with the element `to` added, `end` is `True`, `e[True]` (or `e[1]`) has at least two elements, `dep[to]` is `1`, and `pred[to]` is `True`.**
