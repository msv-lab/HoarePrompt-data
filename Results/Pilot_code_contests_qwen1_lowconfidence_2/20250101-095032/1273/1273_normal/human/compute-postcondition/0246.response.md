Postcondition: ***`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `bad` is determined as follows: if `not bad` in the if condition, then `bad` remains the same (meaning all `deg[dep[i]]` are equal to `len(e[i])` for all `i` in the range `1` to `n`). Since there is no else part, `bad` does not change if the condition `not bad` is false.***
