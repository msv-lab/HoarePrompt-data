Output State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` is a queue of elements where each element has a depth recorded in `dep`, `e[cur]` is an iterable containing all neighbors of `cur`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to]` was initially -1.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`.
- The loop iterates over all neighbors (`to`) of `cur` in the adjacency list `e[cur]`.
- For each neighbor `to` where `dep[to]` is initially -1 (indicating it has not been visited yet), `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `to` is appended to `q` to process its neighbors in the next iteration.
- After the loop finishes executing, `dep` will have the correct depth values for all reachable nodes from the initial `cur` node, and `q` will be an ordered list of nodes to be processed according to their depth levels.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `e[cur]` is empty or `dep[to]` is never -1 for any `to` in `e[cur]`), then:
- `q` remains as it was after removing the leftmost element.
- `cur` remains the same as the original value.

This ensures that the final state captures the complete behavior of the loop under all possible scenarios.
