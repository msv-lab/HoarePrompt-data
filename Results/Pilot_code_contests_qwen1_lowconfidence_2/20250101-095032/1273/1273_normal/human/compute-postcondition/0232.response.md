`bad` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0), and `bad` is True.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0), and `bad` is True**
