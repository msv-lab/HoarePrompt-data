Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed. If `dep[to]` equals -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and list `q` now includes the value of `to`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
