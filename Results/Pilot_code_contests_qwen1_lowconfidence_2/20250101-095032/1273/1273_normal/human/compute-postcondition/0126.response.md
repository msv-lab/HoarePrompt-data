The code `pred[to] = end` updates the value of `pred[to]` to the current value of `end`. Given the initial state where `end` is `True`, `pred[to]` will be set to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least 2 elements, `end` is True, `e[True]` must have at least one element remaining, `dep[to]` is either 1 or 2, `pred[to]` is True**
