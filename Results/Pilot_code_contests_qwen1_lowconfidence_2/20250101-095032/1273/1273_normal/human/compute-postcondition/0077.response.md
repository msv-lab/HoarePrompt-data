The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is the last element processed.
- `end` is equal to `cur`.
- `e[end]` must contain at least one element.
- `dep[to]` is `-1`.

After executing `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1`:

- The value of `dep[to]` changes to `dep[end] + 1`. Since `end` is equal to `cur`, `dep[end]` is `0`. Therefore, `dep[to]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
- The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, `e[end]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is `1`.**
