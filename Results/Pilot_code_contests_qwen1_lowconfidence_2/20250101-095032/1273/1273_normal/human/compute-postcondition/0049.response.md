Postcondition: ***`q` is a queue with the first element being `cur` and the last element being `to`; `cur` is the first element in the updated queue; `dep[cur]` remains unchanged. If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. No other changes occur if the condition `dep[to] == -1` is not met.***
