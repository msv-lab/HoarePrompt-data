Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the last element processed in `q`, `q` is an empty list, `dep` is fully populated with depths for all nodes from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and each node's depth `dep[cur]` is correctly calculated based on its parent's depth `dep[parent] + 1`. If `q` becomes empty, the loop terminates.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `deg` is an array of size \(n+1\) initialized to \([-1]\), indicating that initially, the degree of all nodes is unknown. `cur` starts as the first element of `q`. `q` is a list containing nodes to be processed, starting with the root node. `dep` is an array representing the depth of each node from the root, initialized to \([-1]\). `top` remains unchanged. `n` is a positive integer, and `bad` is initially `False`.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop processes each node `to` connected to the current node `cur`.
  - If `dep[to]` is \(-1\), it means `to` has not been visited yet. In this case, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, indicating that `to` is a child of `cur` and is one level deeper.
  - `q` is updated by appending `to` to it, allowing further processing of `to` in subsequent iterations.
  - `cur` is updated to the next node in `q`.

- **Termination Condition**:
  - The loop continues until there are no more elements in `q`, meaning all reachable nodes from the root have been processed.
  - Once `q` becomes empty, the loop terminates.

- **Final State**:
  - `deg` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the loop.
  - `cur` becomes the last node processed when `q` is empty.
  - `q` becomes an empty list since all nodes have been processed.
  - `dep` is fully populated with the correct depth values for all nodes.
  - `top` remains unchanged.
  - `n` and `bad` also remain unchanged.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
