The code initializes a list `deg` with -1 for each index from 0 to n (inclusive). The length of this list is n+1. The initial state of the other variables (`q`, `end`, `dep`, and `pred`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length n+1 with all elements initialized to -1.**
