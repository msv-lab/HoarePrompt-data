Postcondition: ***`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (the right end of `q` is now `to`), `e[cur]` is an iterable and contains at least one element, `to` is the next element from `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` regardless of whether `dep[to]` is initially `-1` or not.***
