To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state after the previous iteration.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition: `while q:`
- Current state after the previous iteration:
  - `deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\)
  - `cur` is the last node visited in the DFS traversal from `top`
  - `q` is empty
  - `dep` is the depth of each node from the root `top`
  - `top` is the same
  - `n` is a positive integer
  - `bad` is `False`
  - `i` is `n + 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `q` is non-empty.
2. **Current State**: `q` is empty.

Since `q` is currently empty, the loop condition `while q:` will not be satisfied, and thus, the loop will terminate.

### Required Adjustments:
To make the loop execute one more time, we need to ensure that `q` is non-empty. This means we need to add at least one element to `q`.

Given the current state, no other states directly influence the condition `q`. Therefore, we only need to adjust `q` to be non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the last node visited in the DFS traversal from `top`, `q` must contain at least one element, `dep` is the depth of each node from the root `top`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`**
