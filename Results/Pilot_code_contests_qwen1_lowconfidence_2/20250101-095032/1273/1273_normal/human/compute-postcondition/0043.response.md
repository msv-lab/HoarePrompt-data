`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The value of `dep[cur]` is known from the initial state, and it is added by 1 to determine the new value of `dep[to]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is the original queue with the first element removed and potentially appended with some elements, `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, `dep[cur]` remains the same, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and the condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.**
