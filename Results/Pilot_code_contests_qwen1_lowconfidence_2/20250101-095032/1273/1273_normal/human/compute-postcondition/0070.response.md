The code `dep[cur] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the element in the `dep` list at the index given by the variable `cur`. The initial state is that `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `-1`, and `cur` is the last element processed (which is not specified here but is part of the context). After executing this line, the value of `dep[cur]` will be `0`, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. The variable `q` and the list `pred` are not affected.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`; `q` is empty; `cur` is the last element processed**
