`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. The value of `dep[cur]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `cur`, so `dep[to]` becomes the shortest distance from the starting node to node `to`, which is one more than the distance to `cur`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and there are no more elements to process.**
