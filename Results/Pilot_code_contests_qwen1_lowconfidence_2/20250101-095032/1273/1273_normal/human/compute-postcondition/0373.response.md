`bad` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state of `bad` being `False` if `deg[dep[i]] == len(e[i])` and `True` otherwise does not change because the condition for `bad` being `False` is no longer checked after assigning `True`. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)` with the exception of `deg[dep[i]]` which is set to `len(e[i])` if `deg[dep[i]] == -1`; `cur` is undefined or the first node processed; `q` is initialized or contains all nodes; `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth; `top` is undefined or the first leaf node found; `n` is a positive integer; `bad` is `True`; and `i` is `1`.**
