The code initializes a deque `q` with the value `end`. This affects the `q` variable but does not change the values of `dep`, `end`, `center`, or `pred`. The length of the list `dep` remains `n+1` with every element still being `-1`. The value of `dep[end]` is still `0`.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`, `q` is a deque containing `[end]`.**
