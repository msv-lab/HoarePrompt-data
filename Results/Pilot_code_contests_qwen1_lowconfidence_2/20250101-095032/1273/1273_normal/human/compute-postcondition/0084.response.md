`q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The value of `to` is `1` or `2` based on the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`; `dep[to]` is `1` or `2`; `cur` is the last element processed; `end` is equal to `cur`; `pred[to]` is equal to `cur`; `q` is a list with `to` appended to it.**
