The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `dep[to]`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
