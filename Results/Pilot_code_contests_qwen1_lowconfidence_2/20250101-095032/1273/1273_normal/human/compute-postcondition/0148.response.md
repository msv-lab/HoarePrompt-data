Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State:
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `end` is the last node processed.
- `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node.
- `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree.
- `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where `deg[dep[i]]` is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])`.
- `bad` is `True` if `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive).
2. **Iteration Count**: Since the loop starts from `1`, it means we are currently processing the `i-th` iteration where `i` is the current value of `i`.

### Adjusting States:
- **`i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` is `1`.
- **`n`**: `n` must be greater than `0` as per the initial condition.
- **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `[1, n+1)`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by `1` from its current value. If it was `1` initially, it will become `2` for the next iteration.
- `n` remains the same unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no changes to `n` are mentioned, `n` stays the same.
- Other variables like `q`, `end`, `dep`, `pred`, `deg`, and `bad` remain unchanged unless modified inside the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where `deg[dep[i]]` is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])`, `bad` is `True` if `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

This is the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
