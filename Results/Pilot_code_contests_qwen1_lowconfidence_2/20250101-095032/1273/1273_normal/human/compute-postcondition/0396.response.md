Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dep[to]` is set to `-1` if it was previously `-1`. Otherwise, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
   - `cur` and `to` remain unchanged.
   - The list `q` is initialized to `[to]`.

2. **Understand the Loop Statement:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `to` in the list `e[cur]`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the variable `to` must be an element of `e[cur]`.
   - Since `cur` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, we assume `cur` is known from the context (let's denote it as `c`).
   - `dep[to]` needs to be updated based on its current value: if `dep[to]` was not `-1`, then it is now set to `dep[c] + 1`.
   - `q` is initialized to `[to]` at the beginning of each iteration.

Given these points, let's formulate the state adjustments:

- `cur` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, so we denote it as `c`.
- `to` will be an element of `e[c]` for the next iteration.
- `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[c] + 1` if `dep[to]` was not already `-1`.
- `q` is initialized to `[to]` for the next iteration.

So, the new state for the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `dep[to]` is set to `dep[c] + 1` if it was not `-1`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `cur` is `c`, and `q` is initialized to `[to]`.**

To summarize in a clear format:

State: **`dep[to]` is set to `dep[c] + 1` if it was not `-1`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `cur` is `c`, and `q` is initialized to `[to]`.**
