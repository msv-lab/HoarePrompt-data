The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `cur`. The value of `i` remains `n-1` because the code does not modify it. Similarly, the values of `n`, `dep`, and `e` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the assignment to `cur`. The deque `q` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[1] = 0` and all other elements are `-1`, `e` contains `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists at indices `u` and `v` which each contain the sequence of each other repeated `i + 1` times, `q` is a deque containing `1`, `cur` is `1`.**
