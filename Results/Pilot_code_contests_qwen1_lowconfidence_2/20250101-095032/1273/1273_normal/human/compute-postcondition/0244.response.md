The code `print(end)` does not assign any new values to variables or affect any existing ones. It simply prints the value of the variable `end`. However, since the variable `end` is not defined in the initial state, no value is actually printed, and the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False` if all `deg[dep[i]]` are equal to `len(e[i])` for all `i` in the range `1` to `n`, otherwise `bad` is `True`.**
