Postcondition: ***`q` is the original queue with the first element removed, `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`, `e[cur]` contains at least one element. If `dep[to]` equals -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `q` is appended with `to`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dep[to]`.***
