The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the most internal loop or conditional block is broken out of. Since no variables are updated or affected by this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is an empty queue, `dep` remains the same, `top` is set to `to` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
