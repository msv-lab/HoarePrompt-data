The `break` statement does not modify any variables but rather breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context. However, since no loop or switch is present, the `break` statement effectively ends the execution of the current block of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `bad` is True**
