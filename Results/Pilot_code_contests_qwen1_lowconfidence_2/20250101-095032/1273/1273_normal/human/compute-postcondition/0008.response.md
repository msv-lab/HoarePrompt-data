The code `e[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in the list `e`. Given the initial state, `e[u]` is `[v, u]`, and the code simply appends `v` to this list, making `e[u]` become `[v, u, v]`.

Therefore, the updated state of `e[u]` is `[v, u, v]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u, v]`, `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input**
