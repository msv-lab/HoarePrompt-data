According to the given code snippet, the for loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`. For this loop to execute, the variable `i` must start from 1 and go up to `n + 1` inclusive.

Let's break down the initial states and what needs to be adjusted:

1. **`dep`**: A list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node. No changes are needed for this list as it is already defined with the correct length.
2. **`center`**: The node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`. No changes are needed for this variable as it is not directly involved in the loop condition.
3. **`dep[end]`**: Contains the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`. No changes are needed for this specific element as it is already defined.
4. **`cur`**: Initially set to `None` (indicating `q` is empty). No changes are needed for this variable as it is already correctly initialized.
5. **`q`**: An empty deque. No changes are needed for this variable as it is already correctly initialized.
6. **`deg`**: A list of length `n + 1` initialized to `-1`. No changes are needed for this list as it is already defined with the correct length and initialization.
7. **`bad`**: Initially set to `False`. No changes are needed for this variable as it is already correctly initialized.

The key aspect here is ensuring that the loop can start and iterate correctly. The loop will start when `i` is 1 and continue until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:

- `i` must start from 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0)**
