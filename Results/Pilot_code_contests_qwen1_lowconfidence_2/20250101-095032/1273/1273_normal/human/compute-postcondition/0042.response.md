Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `q` is the original queue with the first element removed.
   - `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`.
   - `e[cur]` contains at least one element.
   - If `dep[to]` equals -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `q` is appended with `to`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dep[to]`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - For each `to`, if `dep[to]` equals -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `to` is appended to `q`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `to` in `e[cur]`, it means that the current `cur` remains the same for the next iteration.
   - `q` might change because if `dep[to]` is -1, `to` is appended to `q`.
   - `cur` remains unchanged as the loop is iterating through all elements in `e[cur]`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
     - `cur` remains the same, but `cur`'s value does not change.
     - `q` could have changed if any `to` was appended to it during the loop execution.
     - `e[cur]` still contains at least one element since the problem statement guarantees this.
     - `dep[to]` values may have changed, but the condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.

5. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, `cur` remains the same.
   - `q` could be modified if `to` was appended to it.
   - `e[cur]` still contains at least one element.
   - The condition for updating `dep[to]` still holds, meaning `dep[to]` could have been updated or not.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `cur` remains the same as before the loop.
- `q` is modified if any `to` was appended to it.
- `e[cur]` still contains at least one element.
- `dep[to]` values might have changed but the condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`q` is the original queue with the first element removed and potentially appended with some elements, `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, and `dep[to]` values might have changed but the condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.**
