The initial state includes several variables: `deg`, `cur`, `q`, `dep`, `top`, `n`, `bad`, and `i`. The line of code `dep = [-1] * (n + 1)` updates the variable `dep` to be a list of length `n + 1`, where every element in the list is `-1`.

After executing this line of code, the variable `dep` is updated, but the other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
