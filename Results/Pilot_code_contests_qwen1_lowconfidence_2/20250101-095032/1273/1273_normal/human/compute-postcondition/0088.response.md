The code snippet assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. Based on the initial state, `end` is equal to `cur`, and `to` is an unprocessed neighbor of `end`, meaning `dep[to]` is either `2` or `3`.

The impact of the code on the program is that `pred[to]` is now assigned the value of `end`, which is `cur`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1`, `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`, `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, and for any unprocessed neighbor `to` of `end`, `dep[to]` is now `2` or `3`; `pred[to]` is equal to `cur`.**
