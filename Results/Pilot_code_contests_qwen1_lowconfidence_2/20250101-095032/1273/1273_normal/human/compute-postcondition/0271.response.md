The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and relationships between the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` must not be -1; `top` is `to`; `q` is an empty list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
