Postcondition: **`cur` is the value of `q.popleft()` and `q` is the queue after removing the leftmost element and must still be non-empty. `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth. `top` is set to the last leaf node encountered or undefined if no such node exists. `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and the depth of `to` is not -1. Additionally, the length of `e[to]` is exactly 1**.
