The code `pred[to] = end` updates the value of `pred[to]` to be equal to `end`. Based on the initial state, `pred[to]` was originally `end`, but now it is explicitly set to `end`.

- `dep[to]` remains unchanged and is still `dep[end] + 2`.
- `dep[end]` retains its original value.
- `q` contains `to`.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 2`
- `pred[to]` is `end`
- `q` contains `to`

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 2`, `pred[to]` is `end`, `q` contains `to`**
