The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` increments the value of `dep[to]` by the value of `dep[cur]` plus 1. The variables `cur`, `e[cur]`, `q`, and `to` remain unaffected. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `dep[to]`.

Output State: **`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
