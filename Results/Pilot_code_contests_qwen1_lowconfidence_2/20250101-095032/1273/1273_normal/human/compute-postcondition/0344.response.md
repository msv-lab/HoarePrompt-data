The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. This condition is only met when `len(e[to]) == 2`, according to the initial state description.

The impact of this code is to directly update the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`, while other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a queue with `cur` potentially modified and either `to` added or remaining as is, `dep` now has `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is set to `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`, if `len(e[to]) == 1`, `q` becomes an empty queue and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `q` remains non-empty and contains `cur` with possibly new nodes added. If `dep[to] == -1`, the above conditions hold true.**
