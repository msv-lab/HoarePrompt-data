The code assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. The initial state indicates that `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`, and `to` is a state index while the value of `dep[end]` is unspecified. After executing the code, the value of `pred[to]` is set to `end`.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`, `to` is a state index, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`, the value of `dep[end]` is unspecified**
