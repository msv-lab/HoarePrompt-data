`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[end] + 1`. Since `dep[end]` is not specified in the initial state, it can be any integer value. The value of `dep[to]` is updated to this new value. The state of `to` and `end` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`, `to` is a state index, `dep[end]` is unspecified**
