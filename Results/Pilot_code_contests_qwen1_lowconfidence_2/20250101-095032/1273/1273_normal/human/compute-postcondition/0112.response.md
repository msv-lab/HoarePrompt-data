The code `end = q.popleft()` impacts the variable `q` by removing the first element from it and assigning that element to `end`. Since the initial state is that `q` must be True, and assuming `q` is a deque (or list) containing only one element which is `True`, after the operation, `q` will be empty and `end` will be assigned the value `True`.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is True**
