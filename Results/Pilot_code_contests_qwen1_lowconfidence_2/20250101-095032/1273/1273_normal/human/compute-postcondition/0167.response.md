The code initializes the list `dep` with `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. This means that every element in the list `dep` will be set to `-1`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `dep[end]` is at least `2 * (number_of_iterations + 1)` and less than `2 * (number_of_iterations + 2)`
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`
- If the loop does not execute, `dep[end]` is less than 2 and `center` remains `end`

After running the code `dep = [-1] * (n + 1)`, the values of `dep[end]` and `center` remain unchanged because the code only initializes a new list `dep` and does not affect the values of `dep[end]` or `center`.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is at least `2 * (number_of_iterations + 1)` and less than `2 * (number_of_iterations + 2)`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`.**
