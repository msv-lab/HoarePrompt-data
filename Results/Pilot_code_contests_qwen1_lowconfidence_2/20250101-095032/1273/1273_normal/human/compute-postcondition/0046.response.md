Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `q` is a queue where its first element is removed and potentially appended with some elements plus `to`.
   - `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`.
   - `e[cur]` contains at least one element.
   - `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
   - `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
   - The condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis of Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, the condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `q` should be adjusted to reflect that the first element (which was `cur`) has been processed.
   - `cur` should be set to the next element that is processed from the queue, which is the first element in `q` after processing the current `cur`.
   - `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
   - The condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds, meaning `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `q` now starts with the next element that was originally in `q` but is no longer the first element because it has been processed.
   - `cur` is now the first element in the updated `q`.
   - `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
   - `dep[to]` is not relevant for the initial adjustment; it will be updated in subsequent iterations.
   - The condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`q` is a queue where its first element is removed, `cur` is the first element in the updated queue, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and the condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.**

This means the state after removing the first element from `q` and setting `cur` to the new first element in the queue.
