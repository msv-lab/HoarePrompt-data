The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This affects the list `q` by adding a new element to it. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `q`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes, `e[cur]` must be non-empty, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `q` is now a list with one additional element `to`.**
