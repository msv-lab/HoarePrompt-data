The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the loop or the most internal loop/if statement. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to -1, and the current value of `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`, `bad` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
