Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the deque `q` is not empty.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is updated such that `dep[node]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`.
   - `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`.
   - `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
   - `cur` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred` and no longer in the deque `q`.
   - `e[cur]` must have been processed for all nodes reachable from `cur`.
   - `q` is an empty deque.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty at the start of the next iteration. However, the current state explicitly mentions that `q` is an empty deque.

4. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `q` is not empty at the start of the next iteration. This typically involves adding nodes to `q`.

Given the information, we can summarize the necessary adjustments as follows:

- The state needs to be modified to ensure that `q` is not empty at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is updated such that `dep[node]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred` and no longer in the deque `q`, `e[cur]` must have been processed for all nodes reachable from `cur`, and `q` must contain at least one node**.
