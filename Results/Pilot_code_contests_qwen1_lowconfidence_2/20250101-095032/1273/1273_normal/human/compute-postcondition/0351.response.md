Postcondition: ***`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a queue with elements that may have been added based on the conditions, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, and `top` is set to `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, `q` becomes an empty queue and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; otherwise, `q` remains non-empty and contains `cur` and `to`. This applies regardless of whether `dep[to] == -1` or not since there is no else part, and the if part already covers all possible conditions.***
