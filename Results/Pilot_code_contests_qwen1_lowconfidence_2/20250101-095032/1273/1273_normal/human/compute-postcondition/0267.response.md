The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. Since `cur` is `center` and `e[cur]` contains at least one element, each `to` in `e[cur]` will have its `dep[to]` updated to be `dep[cur] + 1`.

The output state after the code execution is:
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `cur` is `center`.
- For all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `cur` is `center`; for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**.
