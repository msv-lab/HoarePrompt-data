To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements for the `for` loop to run.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over `range(1, n + 1)`. This means that the loop will start from `i = 1` and continue up to `i = n`.
2. **Variable `i`**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to `1` at the beginning of the loop.
3. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` should be such that there are at least `n` iterations. Given that `n` is already stated as a positive integer, we don't need to change this state directly. However, we must ensure that `n` is indeed a positive integer.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial values of `i` to `1` and ensure that `n` is a positive integer, which is already stated.

### Adjusted States:

- `i` needs to be set to `1` to start the loop.
- Ensure that `n` is a positive integer, which is already stated but needs to be explicitly mentioned for clarity.

Thus, the states that need adjustment are:

**State:**
- `deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`
- `cur` is undefined or the last node processed
- `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes
- `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth
- `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found
- `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`
- `i` is `1`

So, the final state to be used at the start of the loop is:

**State:**
- `deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`
- `cur` is undefined or the last node processed
- `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes
- `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth
- `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found
- `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`
- `i` is `1`
