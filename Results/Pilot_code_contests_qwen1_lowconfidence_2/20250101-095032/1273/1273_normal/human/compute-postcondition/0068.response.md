The code initializes a list `dep` with `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. The initial values of `q`, `cur`, and `dep` for every node are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, `q` remains empty, `cur` remains the last element processed, and `dep` is now a list of length `n + 1` where each element is initialized to `-1`.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `cur` is the last element processed, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `-1`.**
