Postcondition: ***`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`***

Explanation: Since the if condition is `if (not bad)`, the condition inside the if statement is that `bad` must be `False`. Therefore, we retain all the conditions from the precondition, and specifically mention that `bad` is `False` within the postcondition.
