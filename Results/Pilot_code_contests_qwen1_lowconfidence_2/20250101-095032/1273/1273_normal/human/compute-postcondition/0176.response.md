Postcondition: ***`dep[end]` is 0, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`, `q` contains the element `to` appended, `cur` is the first element of the deque `q` before it was removed, and `e[cur]` must have at least one element. After the if-else block executes, `dep[to]` is set to 0 and `q` contains the element `to` appended.***
