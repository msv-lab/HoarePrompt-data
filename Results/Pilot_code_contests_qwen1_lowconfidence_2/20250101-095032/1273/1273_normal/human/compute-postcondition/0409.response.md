The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be the value of `dep[cur]` plus 1. Given the initial state, `dep[cur]` is known to be `dep[to] - 1` if `dep[to]` was previously `-1` (since `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to] == -1`). All other variables remain unchanged.

So, the updated state is:
- `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.
- All other variables (`deg`, `cur`, `q`, `dep`, `top`, `n`, and `bad`) remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is now \([cur, to]\), `dep` is the depth of each node from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
