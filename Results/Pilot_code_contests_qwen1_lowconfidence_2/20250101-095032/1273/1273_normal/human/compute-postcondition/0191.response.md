The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the node `to` to the end of the deque `q`. This means that the value of `q` changes, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is updated to represent the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element, `e[cur]` must have been processed for all nodes reachable from `cur`, `q` is the deque with its first element removed and appended with `to`, and `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1**
