Output State: **`q` is a queue that initially has the first element removed from the original queue, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` contains all nodes that are reachable from `cur`, `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` in the graph, and for every node `to` in `e[cur]`, if `dep[to]` was initially -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. If the loop does not execute at all, `q` is the original queue with the first element removed, `cur` is the first element of `q`, and `dep` remains unchanged.**
