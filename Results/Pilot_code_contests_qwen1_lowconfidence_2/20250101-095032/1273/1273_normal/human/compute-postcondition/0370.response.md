Postcondition: ***`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)` with the exception of `deg[dep[i]]` which is set to `len(e[i])` if `deg[dep[i]] == -1`. `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True` if `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` remains `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`.***
