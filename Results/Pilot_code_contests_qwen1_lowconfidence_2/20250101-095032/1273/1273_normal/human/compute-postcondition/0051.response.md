To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

1. The loop condition is `while q:`.
2. For the loop to continue, `q` must not be empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is described as "a queue that initially has the first element removed from the original queue." This implies that `q` was not empty before the loop started. Therefore, after the first iteration, `q` must still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.

Let's break down the information given:
- `q` is a queue that initially has the first element removed.
- `cur` is the first element of `q`.
- `e[cur]` contains all nodes that are reachable from `cur`.
- `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` in the graph.
- For every node `to` in `e[cur]`, if `dep[to]` was initially -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must contain at least one element. Since the queue operation (removing the first element) is performed within the loop body, we know that after the first iteration, `q` must still contain elements. 

Therefore, no specific adjustments to the states (`q`, `cur`, `e[cur]`, `dep[cur]`, etc.) are required to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The only thing that matters is that `q` is not empty.

**State:**
**`q` is a non-empty queue, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `e[cur]` contains all nodes that are reachable from `cur`, `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` in the graph, and for every node `to` in `e[cur]`, if `dep[to]` was initially -1, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
