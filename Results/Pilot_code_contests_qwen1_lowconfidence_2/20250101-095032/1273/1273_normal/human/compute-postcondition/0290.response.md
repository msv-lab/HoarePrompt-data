`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. From the initial state, `dep[to]` is equal to -1, and `dep[cur]` is the current depth of `cur`. Therefore, after executing the code, `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and the length of `e[to]` is equal to 2**
