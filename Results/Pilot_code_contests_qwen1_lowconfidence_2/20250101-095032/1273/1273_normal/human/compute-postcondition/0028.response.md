`q` has its right end appended with the value `to`. The value of `cur` and `dep[to]` remain unchanged, and `e[cur]` still contains at least one element. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `q` has an additional element at its right end, which is `to`.
- `cur` remains the element that was removed from the left end of `q`.
- `dep[to]` is still `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contains at least one element.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (the right end of `q` is now `to`), `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
