Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is valid and greater than 0, and `bad` remains unchanged. If `deg[dep[i]]` equals `-1`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, then `bad` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `bad` remains unchanged.***
