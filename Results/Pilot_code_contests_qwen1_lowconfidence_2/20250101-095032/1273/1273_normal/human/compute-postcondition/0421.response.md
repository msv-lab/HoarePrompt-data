The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[cur]` is known, and `to` is the current element being processed in `q`. Since `cur` is the first element of `q`, and `q` is updated to be `q` without its first element, `cur` is no longer the first element. However, the value of `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.

The other variables remain in their initial states or are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` without its first element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root.**
