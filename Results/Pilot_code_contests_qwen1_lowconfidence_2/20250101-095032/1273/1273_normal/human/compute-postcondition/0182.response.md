The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. Based on the initial state, `dep[to]` was originally `-1`, and `dep[cur]` is some integer value since `dep[cur] + 1` is being assigned to `dep[to]`. Therefore, `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1` except `dep[to]` which is now `dep[cur] + 1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is `0`, `cur` is the next element of the deque `q` before it was removed, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, and `q` contains `to` appended and now has at least two elements.**
