The code snippet `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` modifies the dictionary `deg` by setting the value at the key `dep[i]` to the length of the list `e[i]`. However, the initial values of `dep` and `e` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values after the operation. We can only state that the dictionary `deg` is updated.

Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 1, this condition remains unchanged as the code does not affect `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `deg` is updated such that `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])` for the given index `i`.**
