Output State: **`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `to` has `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, `top` is now `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`, `q` remains an empty queue and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `len(e[to]) == 1`, otherwise `q` remains non-empty and contains `cur` with possibly new nodes added.**
