`to` is appended to the list `q`. The value of `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, and `dep[end]` retains its original value. The value of `pred[to]` is `end`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `dep[end]` retains its original value, `pred[to]` is `end`, and `q` contains `to`.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `dep[end]` retains its original value, `pred[to]` is `end`, `q` contains `to`**
