Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`
   - `pred[to]` is equal to `end`
   - `q` contains `[to]`
   - The value of `dep[end]` remains unchanged

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for to in e[end]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over all elements in the list `e[end]`.
   - For each `to` in `e[end]`, the loop body is executed.

4. **What Needs to Change for the Next Iteration?**
   - The variable `to` changes with each iteration of the loop.
   - `dep[to]` will be set to `dep[end] + 1` for the new `to` value.
   - `pred[to]` will be set to `end` for the new `to` value.
   - `q` will be updated to include the new `to` value.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[end] + 1` for the new `to` value.
   - `pred[to]` will be updated to `end` for the new `to` value.
   - `q` will be updated to include the new `to` value.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- **New `to` value:** This is the current value of `to` in the previous iteration, but we don't know its exact value. However, we know that it will be different in the next iteration.
- **`dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[end] + 1`:** The new `to` will have this property.
- **`pred[to]` will be updated to `end`:** The new `to` will have this property.
- **`q` will contain the new `to`:** The new `to` will be added to `q`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `to` from the previous iteration, we just need to ensure that the new `to` satisfies the conditions and is included in `q`.

**State:**
**`dep[new_to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[new_to]` is equal to `end`, `q` contains `[new_to]` and the value of `dep[end]` remains unchanged.**

Here, `new_to` represents the new value of `to` in the next iteration.
