Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- Each element in `dep` is either `-1` or `0`.
- `dep[cur]` is `0`.
- If `dep[to]` is `-1`, then after processing `to`, `dep[to]` is set to `1`, `q` contains `to`, and `pred[to]` is `end`.
- `cur` is the last element processed.
- `end` is equal to `cur`.
- `e[end]` must contain at least one element (this ensures there are elements to process in the current iteration).

### For Loop Statement:
```
for to in e[end]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is based on whether `e[end]` contains at least one element.
   - Since it is given that `e[end]` must contain at least one element, this condition is satisfied at the start of the loop.

2. **Variables Involved:**
   - `end`: This remains unchanged as it is equal to `cur` from the previous iteration.
   - `e[end]`: This list must contain at least one element to proceed into the loop.

3. **Loop Body Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `to` in `e[end]`.
   - During each iteration, if `dep[to]` is `-1`, then:
     - `dep[to]` is set to `1`.
     - `q` contains `to`.
     - `pred[to]` is set to `end`.

4. **End of Current Iteration:**
   - After the loop completes for one iteration, `to` will be the last element processed in this iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `cur` will be `to`.

5. **Next Iteration Setup:**
   - For the next iteration, `end` will be updated to `cur` from the current iteration.
   - The next value of `cur` will be the last element processed in the current iteration (`to`).
   - `e[end]` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `end` will now be equal to `to` from the previous iteration.
- `cur` will be the last element processed in the previous iteration, which is `to`.
- `dep[to]` might have been set to `1` during the loop execution if `dep[to]` was `-1`.
- `q` will contain all elements `to` such that `dep[to]` was `-1` and was set to `1`.
- `pred[to]` will be set to `end` for all such elements `to`.

### Final State:
State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`. If `dep[to]` is `-1`, after processing `to`, `dep[to]` is set to `1`, `q` contains `to`, and `pred[to]` is `end`. `cur` is the last element processed in the previous iteration, `end` is equal to `cur`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**

Given that `cur` is the last element processed in the previous iteration and assuming no elements were processed that changed `dep[cur]` to `1`, the most straightforward update would be:

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`. `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**

However, to be precise, the exact state should reflect any changes made during the loop execution. Assuming no specific changes were made, the simplified answer is:

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`. `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
