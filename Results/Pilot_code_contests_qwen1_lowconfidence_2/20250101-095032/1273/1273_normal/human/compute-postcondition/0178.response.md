The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. According to the initial state, `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`, `dep[end]` is 0, and `cur` is the first element of the deque `q` before it was removed. The value of `dep[cur]` must be `-1` because it is initialized to `-1` for all elements in `dep` and has not been updated yet.

Therefore, `dep[to]` will be updated to `-1 + 1`, which is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `0`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is `0`, `cur` is the first element of the deque `q` before it was removed, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, and `q` contains `to` appended and must have at least one more element**
