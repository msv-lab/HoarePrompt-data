The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the right end of the list `q`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

- `cur` remains the element that was removed from the left end of `q`.
- `q` now has an additional element at its right end, which is `to`.
- `e[cur]` remains an iterable containing at least one element.
- `to` remains the next element from `e[cur]`.
- `dep[to]` remains `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (the right end of `q` is now `to`), `e[cur]` is an iterable and contains at least one element, `to` is the next element from `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
