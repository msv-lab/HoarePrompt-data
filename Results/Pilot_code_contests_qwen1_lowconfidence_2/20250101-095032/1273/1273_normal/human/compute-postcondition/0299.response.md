Postcondition: **`cur` is the first element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element. If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` (assuming `len(e[to]) == 2`), or the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement (if `len(e[to]) == 1`). Otherwise, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`.**
