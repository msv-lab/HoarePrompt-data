To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

- The loop condition is `while q:`.
- `q` is a deque containing all nodes at the current level of the shortest path tree.
- The loop body processes each node in `q`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` is non-empty at the start of the next iteration.

Given the information about the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dep` is a list of length `n+1`, where each element `dep[i]` represents the shortest path distance from `center` to `i`.
- `i` is the index of the last node processed by the loop.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `bad` remains unchanged.
- `top` is the farthest node from `center` that only has one outgoing edge.
- `q` is a deque containing all nodes at the current level of the shortest path tree.
- `cur` is the current node being processed in the loop.

Since the loop condition is based solely on the deque `q`, and we need `q` to be non-empty for the loop to continue, no other state variables need adjustment as they are not directly involved in determining the loop continuation.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `q` is non-empty for the next iteration.
