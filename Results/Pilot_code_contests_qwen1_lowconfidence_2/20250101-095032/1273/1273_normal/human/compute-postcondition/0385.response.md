To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\)
   - `cur` is undefined or the last node processed
   - `q` is a deque containing `[top]`
   - `dep` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\) with `dep[top]` set to 0
   - `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `bad` is `False`
   - `i` is `n + 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `q` is not empty (`while q:`).

Given that `q` is a deque containing `[top]` and `dep[top]` is set to 0, it means that there is at least one element in `q`. Therefore, the condition `q` being non-empty is satisfied.

Since `q` contains `[top]` and `dep[top]` is set to 0, the loop can execute at least once without needing any adjustments to the given states.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

**State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is a deque containing `[top]`, `dep` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\) with `dep[top]` set to 0, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1**
