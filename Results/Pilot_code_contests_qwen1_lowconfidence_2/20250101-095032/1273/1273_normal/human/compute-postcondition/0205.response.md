Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes, `e[cur]` must be non-empty, and the value of `dep[to]` is `-1`.**
