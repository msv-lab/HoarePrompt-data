The code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to the variable `top`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur` is the value of `q.popleft()` and `q` is the queue after removing the leftmost element and must still be non-empty; `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth; `top` is now set to the value of `to`; `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and the depth of `to` is not -1; the length of `e[to]` is exactly 1**
