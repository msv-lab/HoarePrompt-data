The code updates the value of `center` to the value of `pred[center]`. However, the initial value of `center` is not specified in the initial state. Since no specific value for `center` is given, we can only say that `center` is updated to the value of `pred[center]`.

Output State: **`dep[end]` must be at least 2; `center` is updated to the value of `pred[center]`**
