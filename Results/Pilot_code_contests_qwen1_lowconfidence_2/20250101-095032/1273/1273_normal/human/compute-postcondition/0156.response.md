The code snippet `print(cur)` prints the current value of the variable `cur`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific value for `cur`. It only mentions that `q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])` based on the condition `deg[dep[i]] != -1`, `bad` is `False` since the condition `(not bad)` is true, and `n` must be greater than 0. Since no value is assigned to `cur` before the print statement, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])` based on the condition `deg[dep[i]] != -1`, `bad` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `cur` is printed.**
