Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `deg[dep[i]]` is either `-1` or `len(e[i])` for all valid `i`, `bad` is `True` if there exists any `i` such that `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over nodes from `1` to `n`.
   - For each node `i`, it checks if `deg[dep[i]]` is `-1`.
     - If it is `-1`, then it updates `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`.
     - If it is not `-1`, it checks if `deg[dep[i]]` is equal to `len(e[i])`. If they are not equal, it sets `bad` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

2. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, `deg[dep[i]]` will be either `-1` or `len(e[i])` for each valid `i`.
   - If there exists any `i` such that `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, `bad` will be `True`.
   - If no such `i` exists, `bad` will be `False`.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is `0`), `deg[dep[i]]` remains `-1` for all `i`, `bad` remains `False`, and `n` is `0`.

This ensures that we capture the final state of all relevant variables after the loop has completed its execution.
