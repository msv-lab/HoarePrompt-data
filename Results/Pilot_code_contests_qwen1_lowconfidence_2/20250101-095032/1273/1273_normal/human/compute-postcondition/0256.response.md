`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `dep[cur]` (which is `dep[center]`) must have some specific value, let's denote it as `d_center`. Therefore, `dep[to]` is set to `d_center + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `cur` is `center`, and the current value of `dep[to]` is `d_center + 1`, and the length of `e[to]` is 2**
