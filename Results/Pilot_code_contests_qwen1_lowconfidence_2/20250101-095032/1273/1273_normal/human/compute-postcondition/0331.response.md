Postcondition: ***`cur` is the value of `q.popleft()`, `q` is a non-empty queue; `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth; `top` is now set to the value of `to` if the length of `e[to]` is exactly 1, otherwise `top` remains unchanged; the depth of `to` is not -1.***
