The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the queue `q`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. The value of `cur` remains the value of `q.popleft()`, `q` now includes the original elements plus the new element `to`, `dep` remains unchanged, `top` remains the same, `e[cur]` remains unchanged and must still contain at least one element, the depth of `to` remains `dep[cur] + 1`, and the length of `e[to]` remains 2.

Output State: **`cur` is the value of `q.popleft()`, `q` is the queue after appending the value of `to`, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is set to the last leaf node encountered or undefined if no such node exists, the depth of `to` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and the length of `e[to]` is 2.**
