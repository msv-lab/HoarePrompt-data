Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`. If `dep[to]` is `-1`, `dep[to]` is set to `1`, `q` contains `to`, and `pred[to]` is `end`. `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.***
