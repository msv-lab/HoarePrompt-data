Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the next element of `q` after removing the first element, `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing, `q` now contains its original elements plus the updated `to`, and if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, it is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.***
