Postcondition: ***`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True`, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, `bad` remains `True`. There is no else part specified, so the postcondition does not change if the condition is false.***
