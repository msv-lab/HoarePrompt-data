Postcondition: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are initialized to `-1` unless `deg[dep[i]]` is updated to `len(e[i])`, `bad` is either `True` or remains `False` depending on whether `deg[dep[i]] == -1` or `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
