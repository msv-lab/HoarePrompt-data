The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `bad`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is to the `bad` variable.

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is the last node processed in the DFS traversal, `q` is an empty deque, `dep` contains the depth of each node from the root `top`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`**
