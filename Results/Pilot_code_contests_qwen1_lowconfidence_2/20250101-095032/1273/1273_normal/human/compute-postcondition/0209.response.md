According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to` and the list `e[cur]`. The loop iterates over each element `to` in the list `e[cur]`. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `dep` is a list of length `n+1`
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`
- `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`
- `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element
- `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes
- `e[cur]` must be non-empty
- If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` and `q` is now a list with one additional element `to`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments are needed:

1. `to` should be the first element of `e[cur]` since the loop iterates over the elements of `e[cur]`.
2. After processing `to`, `e[cur]` must become an empty list because it contains no unprocessed nodes.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, and `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed.**

Since `e[cur]` becomes empty after processing `to`, we can simplify the state as follows:

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, and `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed.**

However, since `e[cur]` is empty, we can directly state:

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, and `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed.**

To summarize:

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, and `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed.**
