To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start executing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop runs for `dep[end] // 2` iterations. For the loop to start, `dep[end]` must be greater than or equal to 2 (since `// 2` implies an integer division, and 1 would result in 0 iterations).

2. **Variable `dep[end]`**: This variable represents the shortest path distance from the starting node to the last node processed (`end`). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `dep[end]` must be at least 2.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `q`: The state of the deque is not directly relevant to the loop's execution as long as it is a deque.
   - `end`: The last node processed.
   - `dep`: The dictionary containing the shortest path distances from the starting node.
   - `pred`: The dictionary containing the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree.
   - `deg`: A list of length `n + 1` where each element is either `-1` or updated based on certain conditions.
   - `bad`: Boolean value indicating if something went wrong; this is not directly related to the loop's execution.
   - `center`: The center node, which is set to `end`.
   - `cur`: A variable that is printed but its state is not critical for the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the key condition is that `dep[end]` must be at least 2. All other variables do not necessarily need to be adjusted explicitly for the loop to start executing.

### Final Answer:
State: **`dep[end]` must be at least 2**.
