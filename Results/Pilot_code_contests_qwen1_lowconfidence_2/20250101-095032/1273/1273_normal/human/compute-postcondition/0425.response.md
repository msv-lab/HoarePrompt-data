The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root. Therefore, `dep[to]` will be the depth of `to` from the root, which is one more than the depth of `cur`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` with the second element of `e[cur]` appended to it, `dep[e[cur][1]]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1**
