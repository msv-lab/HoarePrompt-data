Postcondition: ***`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is `top`, `q` is `[to]`, `dep` is \([0, -1, -1, ..., -1]\) with `dep[top]` set to 0 and `dep[to]` set to 1, `top` is a valid last leaf node, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`. Since there is no else part, this state is the final state after the if condition evaluates to true.***
