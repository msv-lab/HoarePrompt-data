Postcondition: ***`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `cur` is `center`, and the current value of `dep[to]` is -1. If `len(e[to])` is 2, then `dep[to]` is set to `d_center + 1`. If `len(e[to])` is 1, then `top` is equal to `to`, `q` is now empty, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `len(e[to])` is not 1, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.***
