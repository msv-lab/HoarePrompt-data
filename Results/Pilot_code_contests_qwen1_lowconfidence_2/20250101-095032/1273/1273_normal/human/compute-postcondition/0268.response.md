The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Since `to` is an element of `e[cur]` and its depth `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, the only thing that changes is that `to` is added to `q`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `cur` is `center`; for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; `q` contains all elements from the previous state plus `to`.**
