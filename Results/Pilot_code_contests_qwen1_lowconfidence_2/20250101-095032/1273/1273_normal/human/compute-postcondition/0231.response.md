`deg[dep[i]]` is assigned the value `len(e[i])`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `dep[i]` refers to `dep[2]`. However, the value of `dep[2]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of the left-hand side of the assignment. But we know that `len(e[i])` will be calculated based on the list `e` at index `i`, which is 2.

Since the initial state only specifies the value of `i` and does not provide information about `dep` and `e`, we can only state that `deg[dep[2]]` is set to the length of `e[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0), `deg[dep[2]]` is `len(e[2])`**
