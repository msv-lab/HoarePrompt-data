`deg[dep[i]]` is updated to be `len(e[i])`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, so the updated value of `deg[dep[n+1]]` is `len(e[n+1])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)` with the exception of `deg[dep[n+1]]` which is now `len(e[n+1])`, `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True` if `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` remains `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
