`q` is updated by appending `to` to it, which means the length of `q` increases by one. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\); `cur` is the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q`; `q` is `q` with the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q` appended to it; `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; `top` is the same; `n` is a positive integer; `bad` is `False`; `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root; `q` is updated with the new element.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\); `cur` is the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q`; `q` is `q` with the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q` appended to it; `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; `top` is the same; `n` is a positive integer; `bad` is `False`; `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root; `q` is updated with the new element.**
