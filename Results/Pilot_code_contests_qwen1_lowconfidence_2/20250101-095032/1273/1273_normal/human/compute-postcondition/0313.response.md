The code `q.clear()` clears the list `q`, meaning it removes all elements from `q`. This affects the state of `q`, making it an empty list. The other variables (`cur`, `e`, `top`, and `to`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `top` is equal to `to`, `q` is an empty list**
