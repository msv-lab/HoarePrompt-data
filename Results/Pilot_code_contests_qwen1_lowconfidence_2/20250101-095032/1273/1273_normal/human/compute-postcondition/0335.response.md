The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. This affects only the `dep` dictionary, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`
- `q` is a non-empty queue with `cur` removed and potentially new nodes added
- `dep` remains the same
- `top` is set to `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`

After the code is executed, the value of `dep[to]` is updated to be `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a non-empty queue with `cur` removed and potentially new nodes added, `dep` now has `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is set to `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`**
