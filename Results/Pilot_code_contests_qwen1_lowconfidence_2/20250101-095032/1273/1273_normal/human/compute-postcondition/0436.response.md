Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`: This means `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`.
   - `cur` is the last node processed in the DFS traversal.
   - `q` is an empty deque.
   - `dep` contains the depth of each node from the root `top`.
   - `top` is the same (though we don't know what its value is).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `bad` is `False`.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The `for` loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive), meaning it will run `n` times.
   - For each iteration, `i` will take on values from `1` to `n`.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - There are no constraints on `cur`, `q`, `dep`, `top`, or `bad` based on the given loop structure. These variables might change inside the loop but do not affect whether the loop starts.

Given these considerations, the key adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than 0 (which is already stated as `n` is a positive integer).

Thus, the state adjustments required for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
