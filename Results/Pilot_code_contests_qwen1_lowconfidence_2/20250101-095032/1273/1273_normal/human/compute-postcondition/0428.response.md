According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to`. The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`, where `e[cur]` is the list of neighbors of `cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\)
- `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`
- `q` is `q` with `to` appended to it
- `dep[e[cur][1]]` is `dep[cur] + 1`
- `top` is the same
- `n` is a positive integer
- `bad` is `False`
- `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root

For the loop to execute one more time, `to` must be an element of `e[cur]` and `dep[to]` must be `-1` (indicating that `to` has not been visited yet). This ensures that we are visiting a new node.

Let's update the states step by step:

1. **Update `cur`:** `cur` moves to the next neighbor in `e[cur]`.
2. **Update `q`:** `q` is updated by appending `to` to it.
3. **Update `dep[to]`:** If `dep[to]` was `-1`, it gets updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Since `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`, it means that the next `to` will be the first neighbor of the current `cur`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `cur` will be the first element of `q`.
- `to` will be the first neighbor of the current `cur`.
- `dep[to]` will be set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was `-1`.

So, the updated states are:
- `deg` remains \([-1] * (n + 1)\)
- `cur` becomes the first element of the updated `q`
- `q` is the updated queue with the new `to` appended
- `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`
- `top` remains the same
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `bad` remains `False`
- `dep[cur]` remains the depth of `cur` from the root

State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` with the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q` appended to it, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root.**
