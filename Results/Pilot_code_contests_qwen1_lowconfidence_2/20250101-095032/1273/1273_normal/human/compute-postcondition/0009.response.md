The code `e[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `e`. The initial state is given as follows:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u, v]`
- `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input
- `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input

After executing the code `e[v].append(u)`, the list at index `v` in `e` will have its last element updated to include `u`. Therefore, the list at index `v` will now contain `[v, u, v, u]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u, v, u], `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input**
