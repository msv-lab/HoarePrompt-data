`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The value of `dep[cur]` is known from the initial state but `to` and `cur` are not specified further in the initial state. However, the initial state mentions that `dep[to]` must be -1, which will be updated. Therefore, `dep[to]` will now be `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it, `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
