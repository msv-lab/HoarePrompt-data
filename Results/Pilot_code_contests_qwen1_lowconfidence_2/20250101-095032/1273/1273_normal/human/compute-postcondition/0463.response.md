The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The description provided gives constraints and relationships related to the structure of a tree but does not specify any input parameters for the function itself. Based on the given information, the function seems to deal with the edges of a tree where `n` represents the number of nodes and the subsequent lines represent the edges connecting these nodes.

Given the constraints and the structure described, the function likely processes this tree structure, but without additional details on the expected output, we cannot specify a return value.

Functionality: **The function processes a tree structure defined by `n` nodes and `(n-1)` edges, where each edge is represented by two integers `v_i` and `u_i` such that `1 ≤ v_i < u_i ≤ n`.**
