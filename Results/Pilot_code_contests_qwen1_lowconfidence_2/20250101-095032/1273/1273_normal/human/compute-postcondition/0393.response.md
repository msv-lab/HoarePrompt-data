`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The `cur` and `to` variables are used in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. However, the value of `dep[to]` is updated based on the value of `dep[cur]` plus 1.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
