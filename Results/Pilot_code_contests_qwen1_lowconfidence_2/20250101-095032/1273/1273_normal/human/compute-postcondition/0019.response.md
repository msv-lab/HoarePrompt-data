To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the `while q:` loop can execute.

1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[1] = 0` and all other elements are `-1`
   - `e` contains `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists at indices `u` and `v` which each contain the sequence of each other repeated `i + 1` times
   - `q` is a deque containing `1`
   - `cur` is `1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `q` is non-empty.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once after the current state. This means we need to ensure that `q` is non-empty when the loop condition is checked.

Given the current state, `q` is a deque containing `1`. This means `q` is non-empty and the loop condition `while q:` will evaluate to `True`.

Since `q` is already non-empty, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute at least one more time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same.

**State:** **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[1] = 0` and all other elements are `-1`, `e` contains `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists at indices `u` and `v` which each contain the sequence of each other repeated `i + 1` times, `q` is a deque containing `1`, `cur` is `1`**
