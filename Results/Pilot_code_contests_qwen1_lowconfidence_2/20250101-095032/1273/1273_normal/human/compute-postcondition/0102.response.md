The code assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. The initial state is that `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, and `dep[end]` retains its original value. After executing the code, `pred[to]` is assigned the value of `end`.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `dep[end]` retains its original value, `pred[to]` is `end`**
