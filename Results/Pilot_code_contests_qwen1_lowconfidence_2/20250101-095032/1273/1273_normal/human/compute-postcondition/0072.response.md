The code `end = cur` assigns the current value of `cur` to the variable `end`. This does not affect any other variables. The output state includes the updated value of `end` and the unchanged values of `dep`, `q`, and `cur`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`; `q` is a deque containing `[cur]`; `cur` is the last element processed; `end` is equal to `cur`.**
