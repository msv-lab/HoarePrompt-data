Functionality: **The function processes a tree structure defined by \( n \) nodes and \( n-1 \) edges. It aims to find a "good" central node in the tree. A node is considered "good" if it satisfies certain conditions related to the degrees of its children. Specifically, for each level in the tree, the number of children of a node should match the degree of that level. If no such node exists, the function prints -1.**

**The function performs the following steps:**

1. Reads the number of nodes \( n \) and the edges of the tree.
2. Builds an adjacency list representation of the tree.
3. Uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to compute the shortest path distances from a root node (1) to all other nodes.
4. Identifies a potential center node based on the shortest path distances.
5. Determines if the potential center node satisfies the condition that the degree of each child matches the level in the tree.
6. If a suitable center node is found, it is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**

- The function assumes that the input is a valid tree with \( n \) nodes and \( n-1 \) edges. If the input does not form a tree (e.g., duplicate edges or cycles), the function may produce incorrect results or crash.
- The function does not handle the case where the input is invalid or the tree structure is not properly formatted. Proper validation of the input should be added to ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
- The function does not explicitly check for the case where no center node satisfies the given conditions. While the function handles this scenario by printing -1, it does not explicitly document this behavior in the postconditions.

In summary, the function finds a "good" central node in a tree if one exists and prints it; otherwise, it prints -1.
