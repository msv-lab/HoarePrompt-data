The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

- `q` remains the original queue with the first element removed.
- `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`.
- `e[cur]` still contains at least one element.
- `dep[to]` is updated to be `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`q` is the original queue with the first element removed, `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`, `e[cur]` contains at least one element, and the node `to` now has a distance value of `dep[cur] + 1`.**
