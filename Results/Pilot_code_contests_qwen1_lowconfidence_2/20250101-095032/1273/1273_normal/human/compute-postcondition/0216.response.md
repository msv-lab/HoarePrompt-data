Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, and there are no more elements to process. If `dep[to]` is `-1`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `to` is appended to `q`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
