The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the current loop or switch statement. However, there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet. Given this, the only thing that happens is that we break out of whatever context this line is placed in. Since no specific context (like a loop) is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the most internal context, which is typically a loop or a function call.

The variables `cur`, `q`, `dep`, `top`, and `e` remain in their previous states because no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet. The value of `cur` is still the value of `q.popleft()`, `q` remains an empty queue, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is now set to the value of `to`, the length of `e[to]` is exactly 1, and the depth of `to` is not -1.

Output State: **`cur` is the value of `q.popleft()`, `q` is an empty queue; `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth; `top` is now set to the value of `to`; the length of `e[to]` is exactly 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
