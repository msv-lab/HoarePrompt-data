`cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `q` using `popleft()`. This operation removes the first element from `q` and assigns it to `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is `q` without its first element, `dep` is the depth of each node from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`**
