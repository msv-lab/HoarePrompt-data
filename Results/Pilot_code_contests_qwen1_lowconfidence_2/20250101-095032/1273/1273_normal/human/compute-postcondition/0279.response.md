The code `q.clear()` clears the list `q`. According to the initial state, no variable `q` was mentioned, so after executing this line, `q` will be an empty list. The other conditions about `e[cur]` and `top` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and there must exist at least one `to` in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[to]) != 1`; `top` is equal to `to`; `q` is an empty list**
