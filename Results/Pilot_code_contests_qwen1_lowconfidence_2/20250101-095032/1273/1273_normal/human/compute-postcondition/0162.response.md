According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `dep[end]`. The loop runs for `dep[end] // 2` iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `dep[end]` must be at least 2, and `center` is updated to the value of `pred[center]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `dep[end] // 2` is greater than 0.
2. **Dep Variable**: For the loop to execute again, `dep[end]` must be at least 3 (since it is divided by 2).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `dep[end]` must be at least 2.
- `center` is updated to the value of `pred[center]`.

For the loop to execute again, `dep[end]` must be at least 3.

State: **`dep[end]` must be at least 3; `center` is updated to the value of `pred[center]`**
