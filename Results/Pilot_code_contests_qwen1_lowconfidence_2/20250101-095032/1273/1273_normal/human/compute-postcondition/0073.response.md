Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`.
   - `q` is a deque containing `[cur]`.
   - `cur` is the last element processed.
   - `end` is equal to `cur`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `q` is not empty.

3. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `q` contains `[cur]`, so `q` is not empty.

4. **Objective:**
   To proceed to the first iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that `q` remains non-empty. Given that `q` already contains `[cur]`, no adjustments are necessary for `q` to be non-empty.

5. **Other States:**
   - The state of `dep` and `cur` and `end` do not affect the loop condition directly. However, since `cur` is the last element processed and `end` is equal to `cur`, these states do not impact the loop condition either.

Given this analysis, no adjustments are required to the current state for the loop to execute at least once.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`; `q` is a deque containing `[cur]`; `cur` is the last element processed; `end` is equal to `cur`**
