The code `break` does not affect any variables; it only breaks out of the current loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement context given, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are initialized to `-1` unless `deg[dep[n]]` is updated to `len(e[n])`, `bad` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
