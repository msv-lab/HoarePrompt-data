The variable `center` is assigned the value of `end`. The value of `end` is the last node processed, which means `center` now holds this value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])` based on the condition `deg[dep[i]] != -1`, `bad` is `False`, `center` is `end`, and `cur` is printed.**
