`cur` is assigned the value of the element at the front of queue `q`, which is removed from `q`. The state of `q` changes because its first element is now removed. The output state is: `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed.**
