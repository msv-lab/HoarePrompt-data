The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the queue `q`. This means that `to` is added to the queue `q`. Given the precondition, `dep[to]` has already been updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `top` is set to `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`.

Since `len(e[to])` is 2 in the initial state, `top` does not get updated to `to`, and `q` remains non-empty containing `cur` with `to` added to it.

Output State: **`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a queue with `cur` and `to` added, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is set to `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, if `len(e[to]) == 1`, `q` becomes an empty queue and the most internal loop or if statement is exited, otherwise, `q` remains non-empty and contains `cur` and `to`.**
