To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and how they are initialized.

1. **Variables involved in the loop:**
   - `to`: This variable is used in the loop to iterate over elements in `e[cur]`.
   - `cur`: This is set to `center` before the loop starts, indicating the starting node for the iteration.

2. **Initial state given:**
   - `dep` is a list of length `n+1` with all elements except the one at index `center` being -1 and the one at index `center` being 0.
   - `i` is `n+1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `bad` remains unchanged.
   - `top` is `center`.
   - `q` is a deque containing no elements.
   - `cur` is `center`.

3. **Loop condition:**
   The loop iterates over `e[cur]`, where `e` is some adjacency list or dictionary representing edges or connections from the current node (`cur`). For the loop to execute, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element (i.e., there must be at least one outgoing edge from the current node).

4. **State adjustments needed:**
   - Since `cur` is set to `center`, the loop will iterate over the neighbors of `center` in `e[cur]`. To ensure the loop can execute, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - Other initial states (`dep`, `i`, `n`, `bad`, `top`, `q`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they provide context about the program's state.

Therefore, the necessary state adjustment is:

**State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `cur` is `center`**
