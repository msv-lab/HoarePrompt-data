The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Here, `dep[cur]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `cur`, and adding 1 means that `dep[to]` now represents the shortest distance from the starting node to node `to`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
