`center` is assigned the value of `pred[center]`. The value of `dep[end]` is at least 3, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dep[end]` is at least 3; `center` is the value of `pred[center]` after the assignment.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is at least 3; `center` is the value of `pred[center]`**
