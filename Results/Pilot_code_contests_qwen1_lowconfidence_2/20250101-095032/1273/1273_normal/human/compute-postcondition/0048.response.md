The code `q.append(to)` appends the variable `to` to the list `q`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables.

- `q` is a queue where its first element was previously removed, and now `to` is appended to it.
- `cur` is the first element in the updated queue `q`.
- `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is a queue with the first element being `cur` and the last element being `to`; `cur` is the first element in the updated queue; `dep[cur]` remains unchanged; `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`**.
