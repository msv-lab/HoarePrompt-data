The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This operation changes the list `q` by adding the new element `to` to its end. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` with `to` appended to it, `dep[e[cur][1]]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1**
