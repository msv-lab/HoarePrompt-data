`cur` is assigned the value of the element that was first in the queue `q` before calling `popleft()`. The `popleft()` function removes this element from `q`. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is the original queue with the first element removed, and `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`.

Output State: **`q` is the original queue with the first element removed, and `cur` is equal to the first element that was removed from `q`.**
