`cur` is assigned the value of the first element in the queue `q` using `popleft()`, which removes this element from `q`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes, and `q` is non-empty before the next iteration starts.**
