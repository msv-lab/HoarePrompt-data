Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the last node processed in the DFS traversal, `q` is an empty deque, `dep` contains the depth of each node from the root `top`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and all nodes have their depths correctly set such that `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` for any node `to` that was added to the queue during the execution of the loop.**
