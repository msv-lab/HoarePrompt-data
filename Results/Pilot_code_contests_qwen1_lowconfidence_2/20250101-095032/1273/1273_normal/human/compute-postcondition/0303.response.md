`top` is assigned the value of `to`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`, and `top` is equal to `to`.
