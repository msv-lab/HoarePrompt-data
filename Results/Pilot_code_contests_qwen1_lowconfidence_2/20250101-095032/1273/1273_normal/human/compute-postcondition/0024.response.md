`q` is appended with the value `to`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it, and `e[cur]` and `dep[to]` remain as specified in the initial state since no changes are made to them.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has `to` appended to it, `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element, the current value of `dep[to]` is 0**
