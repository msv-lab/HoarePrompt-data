The variable `bad` is assigned the value `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the `bad` variable is set to `True`, and all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are initialized to `-1` unless `deg[dep[n]]` is updated to `len(e[n])`, `bad` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
