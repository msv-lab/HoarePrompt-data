The `break` statement is encountered, which means the loop or the innermost conditional block is exited. However, since there are no loops or conditions in the given code snippet, the only affected variable is `bad`, which is set to `True`. All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True`, `i` is `1`, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])]**
