Let's analyze the given while loop and the current state step by step:

The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop continues as long as the deque `q` is not empty.

Current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node.
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`.
- `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
- `cur` is the last element of `q` after all elements have been removed.
- `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes.
- `q` is an empty deque.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty at the start of the next iteration. However, the current state shows that `q` is already empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `q` is non-empty before the next iteration starts.

To achieve this, we need to add nodes to `q` before the loop ends. The most logical way to do this is by adding nodes that satisfy the conditions in the loop body, typically involving processing nodes based on the distances stored in `dep` or `e`.

Since the exact loop body is omitted, we cannot specify exactly what nodes would be added to `q`. However, we can infer that some nodes must be processed and added to `q` to keep it non-empty.

Thus, the state adjustment required is to ensure that `q` is non-empty before the next iteration.

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the last element of `q` after all elements have been removed, `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes, and `q` must be non-empty before the next iteration starts.**
