According to the code, the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0).

Let's analyze the loop condition:
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
- Since `n` is greater than 0, the condition `i <= n` must still hold true.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2 and `n` should remain defined and valid (greater than 0).

State: **`i` is 2 and `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0)**
