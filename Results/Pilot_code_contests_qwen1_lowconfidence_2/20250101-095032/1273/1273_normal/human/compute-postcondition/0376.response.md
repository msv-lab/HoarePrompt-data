Postcondition: ***`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\) with the exception of `deg[dep[i]]` which is set to `len(e[i])` if `deg[dep[i]] == -1`. `cur` is undefined or the first node processed, `q` is initialized or contains all nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is undefined or the first leaf node found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False` if `deg[dep[i]] == len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` remains `True`, and `i` is `1`. If `deg[dep[i]] == -1`, `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])` and `bad` is set to `False`. If `deg[dep[i]] != -1` or `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, the loop or if statement breaks out.***
