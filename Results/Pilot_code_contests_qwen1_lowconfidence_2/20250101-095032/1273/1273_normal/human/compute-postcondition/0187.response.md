The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `cur`. This impacts the value of `cur` and `q`. After this operation, `cur` will hold the value of the first element in the deque `q`, and `q` will lose its first element.

Given the initial conditions:

- `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is updated such that `dep[node]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`.
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`.
- `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
- `cur` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred` and no longer in the deque `q`.
- `e[cur]` must have been processed for all nodes reachable from `cur`.
- `q` must contain at least one node.

After executing `cur = q.popleft()`:

- `cur` is updated to the first element of `q`.
- `q` loses its first element.

The output state is:
Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is updated such that `dep[node]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element, `e[cur]` must have been processed for all nodes reachable from `cur`, and `q` is the deque with its first element removed.**
