Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` contains the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is `None` (indicating `q` is empty), `q` is an empty deque, and for any `to` in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` and `to` is appended to `q`.**
