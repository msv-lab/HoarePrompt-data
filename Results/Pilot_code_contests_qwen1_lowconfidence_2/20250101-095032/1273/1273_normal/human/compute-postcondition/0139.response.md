The code `break` does not affect any variable values directly; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `bad` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than 0, and `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `-1`. Additionally, the condition `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])` is satisfied.**
