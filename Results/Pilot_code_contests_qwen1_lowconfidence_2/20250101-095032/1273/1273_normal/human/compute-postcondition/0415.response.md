Postcondition: ***`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is `[to, new_to, to]`, `dep` is the depth of each node from the root with `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same as `dep`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[new_to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[new_to] == -1`.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part. The if condition `dep[to] == -1` leads to the specified updates in the program state, which are summarized in the postcondition.
