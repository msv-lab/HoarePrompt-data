The variable `bad` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `-1`, `bad` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than 0, and `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `-1`. Additionally, the condition `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])` is satisfied.**
