Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is updated such that `dep[node]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred` and no longer in the deque `q`, `e[cur]` must have been processed for all nodes reachable from `cur`, and `q` is an empty deque.**

### Explanation:
- **`dep`**: The `dep` list is used to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to every other node in the graph. By the end of the loop, `dep[node]` will hold the shortest distance from the starting node to node `node`.
- **`center`**: This variable represents the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`. It remains unchanged unless the loop terminates without processing all nodes.
- **`dep[end]`**: This variable holds the shortest distance from the starting node to the target node `end` by the end of the loop.
- **`cur`**: This variable represents the node that was last processed and is no longer in the deque `q`. Once all nodes reachable from `cur` have been processed, `cur` is removed from `q`.
- **`e[cur]`**: This list contains the neighbors of node `cur`. By the end of the loop, all nodes reachable from `cur` have been processed, meaning `e[cur]` has been fully explored.
- **`q`**: This deque initially contains the starting node. As nodes are processed, they are removed from `q` and added to the end of `q` if their neighbors have not yet been processed. Eventually, `q` becomes empty when all reachable nodes have been processed.

If the loop does not execute at all (e.g., if the starting node is already `end` and there are no edges to process), then:
- `dep` is initialized such that `dep[node]` is `-1` for all nodes except `dep[starting_node]` which is `0`.
- `cur` is the starting node.
- `q` is empty since no nodes need to be processed.

However, the primary state described above reflects the final state after the loop has executed as many times as necessary to process all reachable nodes.
