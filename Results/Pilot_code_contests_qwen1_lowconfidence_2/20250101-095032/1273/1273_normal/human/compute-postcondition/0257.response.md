The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The value of `to` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that `dep[to]` is `d_center + 1` and `e[to]` has a length of 2. The other variables `e[cur]`, `cur` (which is `center`), and the initial value of `dep[to]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `cur` is `center`, the current value of `dep[to]` is `d_center + 1`, the length of `e[to]` is 2, and `q` contains `to`.**
