`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. According to the initial state, `dep[cur]` is `dep[cur] + 1` since `dep[to] == -1`. This means that `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (the right end of `q` is now `to`), `e[cur]` is an iterable and contains at least one element, `to` is the next element from `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
