The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Given the initial state, the values of `dep`, `center`, `number_of_iterations`, `pred`, `end`, `cur`, `e`, and `to` remain unchanged. The only change is that `to` is appended to `q`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; list `q` now includes the value of `to`.**
