Postcondition: ***`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` with `to` appended to it, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root. If `dep[to]` equals -1, these changes are applied. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state.***
