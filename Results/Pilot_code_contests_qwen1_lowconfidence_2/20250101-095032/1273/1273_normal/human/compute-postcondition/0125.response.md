`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[end] + 1`. Given that `dep[end]` was initially either `0` or `1`, and `end` is `True`, the value of `dep[to]` will be either `1` or `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least 2 elements, `end` is `True`, `e[True]` must have at least one element remaining, `dep[to]` is either `1` or `2`, `pred[to]` is `True`, if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, it is now `1`**
