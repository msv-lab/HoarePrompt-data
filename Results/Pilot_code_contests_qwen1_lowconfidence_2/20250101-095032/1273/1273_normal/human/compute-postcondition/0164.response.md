Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dep[end]` is at least 3.
   - `center` is the value of `pred[center]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(dep[end] // 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = dep[end] // 2 - 1`.
   - The loop condition is `i < dep[end] // 2`.

4. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must have been equal to `dep[end] // 2 - 1` because the loop just finished.
   - Therefore, `dep[end] // 2 - 1 < dep[end] // 2` is true.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `dep[end] // 2` after incrementing.
   - This means `i` should now be `dep[end] // 2`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `dep[end] // 2`.
   - The value of `dep[end]` does not change within the loop itself, so it remains at least 3.

7. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `dep[end]` is still at least 3.
   - `center` remains the value of `pred[center]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`dep[end]` is at least 3; `center` is the value of `pred[center]`**
