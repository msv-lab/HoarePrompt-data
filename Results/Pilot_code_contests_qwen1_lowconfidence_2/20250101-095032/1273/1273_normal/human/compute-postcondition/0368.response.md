The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the current loop or switch case. Since there is no loop or switch case in the given state, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
