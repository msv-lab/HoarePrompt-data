The code sets `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`. Given the initial state, `end` is `True` and `dep[to]` is `0`. Since `dep[end]` is equivalent to `dep[True]` or `dep[1]`, and it is given that `dep[to]` equals `0`, we can infer that `dep[True]` or `dep[1]` is also `0`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `dep[to]` becomes `dep[True] + 1`, which is `0 + 1`, resulting in `dep[to]` being `1`.

The output state remains unchanged for the other variables mentioned.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque with the element `to` added, `end` is `True`, `e[True]` (or `e[1]`) has at least two elements, `dep[to]` is `1`, and `pred[to]` is `True`.**
