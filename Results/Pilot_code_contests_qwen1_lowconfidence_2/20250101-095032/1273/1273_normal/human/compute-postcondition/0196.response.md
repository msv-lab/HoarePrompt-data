Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node. With `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`; `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`; `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`; `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element; `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing; `q` now contains its original elements plus `to`.**
