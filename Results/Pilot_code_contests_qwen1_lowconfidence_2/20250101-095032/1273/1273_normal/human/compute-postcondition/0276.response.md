`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. The current depth of `to` (`dep[to]`) is increased by 1 compared to the depth of `cur` (`dep[cur]`). The conditions specified in the initial state—`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and there must exist at least one `to` in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[to]) != 1`—remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and there must exist at least one `to` in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[to]) != 1`; `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
