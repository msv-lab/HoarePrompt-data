Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0)
   - `bad` has been determined based on the condition `deg[dep[2]]`:
     - If `deg[dep[2]]` is `-1`, then `bad` remains unchanged.
     - Otherwise, if `deg[dep[2]]` is not equal to `len(e[2])`, `bad` is set to `True`.
     - Otherwise, `bad` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3.

4. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0), the loop will continue if `i` is still within the range.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be increased to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `bad` remains unchanged unless there is a change in `deg[dep[2]]` or `len(e[2])` during the loop execution, but since we are only considering the state before entering the next iteration, `bad` stays as it was.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0), `bad` remains unchanged**.
