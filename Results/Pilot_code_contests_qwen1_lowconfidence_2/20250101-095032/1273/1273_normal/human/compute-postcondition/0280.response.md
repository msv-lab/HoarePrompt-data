The code `break` is executed, which does not change the values of any variables but indicates the exit from the current loop or conditional block. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and there must exist at least one `to` in `e[cur]` such that `len(e[to]) != 1`; `top` is equal to `to`; `q` is an empty list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
