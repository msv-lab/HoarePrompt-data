Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `dep[to]` is either `dep[cur] + 1` (if `dep[to]` was not -1 before the if statement) or remains -1 (if `dep[to]` was -1 before the if statement).
   - `q` contains the element `to`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Body:**
   - The loop iterates over each `to` in the adjacency list `e[cur]`.
   - For each `to`, it checks some condition (which we assume is inside the loop body) and updates `dep[to]` accordingly.

4. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - `dep[to]` is updated based on the value of `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was not already set.
   - `q` contains `to` at the end of each iteration.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `to` is being iterated over from `e[cur]`, `cur` remains the same.
   - `dep[to]` is updated as described, but the specific value of `dep[to]` for the next `to` will depend on the current state of `dep[cur]`.
   - `q` will contain the next `to` in the next iteration.

6. **Determine the Next `to`:**
   - Given that `q` contains the current `to`, the next `to` will be the next element in `e[cur]`.

7. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `dep[to]` will be updated based on the current `dep[cur]` and the condition in the loop body.
   - `q` will contain the next `to` in `e[cur]`.

Given the above points, let's formulate the new state:

- `dep[to]` will be either `dep[cur] + 1` (if `dep[to]` was not -1 before the if statement) or remains -1 (if `dep[to]` was -1 before the if statement).
- `q` will contain the next `to` in the list `e[cur]`.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`dep[to]` is either `dep[cur] + 1` (if `dep[to]` was not -1 before the if statement) or remains -1 (if `dep[to]` was -1 before the if statement). `q` contains the next element in `e[cur]`.**
