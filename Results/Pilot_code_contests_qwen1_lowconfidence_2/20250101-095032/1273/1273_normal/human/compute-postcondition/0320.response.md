`cur` is assigned the value of `q.popleft()`, which removes and returns the leftmost element of `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is the value of `q.popleft()`, `q` is the queue after removing the leftmost element, `q` must still be non-empty (unless it was empty to begin with, in which case it would become empty), `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, and `top` is set to the last leaf node encountered or undefined if no such node exists.
