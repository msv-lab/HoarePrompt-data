The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `cur` is the second element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`. After executing the code, the value of `cur` remains unchanged, `e[cur]` still must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements, the value of `to` is appended to `q`, and `dep[to]` is still `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the second element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`, `to` is appended to `q`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
