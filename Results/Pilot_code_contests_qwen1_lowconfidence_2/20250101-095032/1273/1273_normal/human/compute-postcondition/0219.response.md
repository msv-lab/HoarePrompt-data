The code initializes a new list `deg` with `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. This operation does not affect any other variables.

- `dep` remains a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node.
- `center` remains the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`.
- `dep[end]` remains containing the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
- `cur` remains `None` (indicating `q` is empty).
- `q` remains an empty deque.
- For any `to` in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, `dep[to]` remains set to `dep[cur] + 1` and `to` remains appended to `q`.

The only new information introduced is the initialization of `deg`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` contains the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is `None` (indicating `q` is empty), `q` is an empty deque, and `deg` is a list of length `n+1` initialized to `-1`.**
