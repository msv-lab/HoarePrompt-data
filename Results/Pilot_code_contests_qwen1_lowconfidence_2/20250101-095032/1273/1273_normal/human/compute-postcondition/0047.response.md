`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The value of `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` gets updated accordingly. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`q` is a queue where its first element is removed, `cur` is the first element in the updated queue, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and the condition for appending `to` to `q` still holds.**
