Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0. If `deg[dep[i]]` is equal to `-1`, then `deg[dep[i]]` is updated to `len(e[i])`. Otherwise, if `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, `n` remains greater than 0 and `bad` is set to True. Otherwise, `n` remains greater than 0 and `bad` remains unchanged.***
