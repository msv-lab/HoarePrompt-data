`q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This operation does not affect the values of `dep[to]` or `pred[to]`. Therefore, the output state is: `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 2`, `pred[to]` is `end`, `q` contains `to` and `to`.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 2`, `pred[to]` is `end`, `q` contains `to` and `to`**
