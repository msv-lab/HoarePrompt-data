The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the value of `dep[end]`. According to the initial state, `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`, and for any unprocessed neighbor `to` of `end`, `dep[to]` is `1` or `2`. This means `dep[end]` can be either `1` or `2`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `dep[end]` is `1`:
   - Any unprocessed neighbor `to` of `end` had `dep[to]` equal to `1` initially.
   - After executing the code, `dep[to]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.

2. If `dep[end]` is `2`:
   - Any unprocessed neighbor `to` of `end` had `dep[to]` equal to `2` initially.
   - After executing the code, `dep[to]` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.

Since `to` is a specific unprocessed neighbor of `end`, and `end` was the last element processed, the output state will reflect this update for all such neighbors.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1`, `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`, `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, and for any unprocessed neighbor `to` of `end`, `dep[to]` is now `2` or `3`.**
