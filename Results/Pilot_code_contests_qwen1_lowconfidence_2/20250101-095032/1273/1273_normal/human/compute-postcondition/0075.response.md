Let's break down the given state and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is the last element processed.
- `end` is equal to `cur`.

### For Loop:
```
for to in e[end]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `end`:**
   - `end` is defined as `cur`. Therefore, `end` equals `cur`, and we know from the given state that `cur` is the last element processed.

2. **List `e[end]`:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `e[end]`. For this loop to execute, `e[end]` must contain at least one element.
   - `e` is a dictionary or list-like structure where `e[end]` should contain at least one valid element to allow the loop to proceed.

3. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop depends on `e[end]` containing at least one element, we need to ensure that `e[end]` is non-empty.
   - The state also mentions that `dep` is a list with specific values, but these values do not directly affect the execution of the for loop itself (they are related to the context of the problem but not the loop's condition).

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `q` being an empty deque does not affect the loop's execution condition.
   - `cur` is already defined and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The key state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `e[end]` contains at least one element.

### Final State:
**State: `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is the last element processed, `end` is equal to `cur`, and `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**

This ensures that the for loop can execute based on the given conditions.
