`q` is a deque with at least 2 elements, `end` is True, `e[True]` must have at least one element remaining, `dep[to]` is either 1 or 2, `pred[to]` is True. The code appends the value `to` to the deque `q`. The length of `q` increases by 1.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least 3 elements (initial 2 elements plus `to`), `end` is True, `e[True]` must have at least one element remaining, `dep[to]` is either 1 or 2, `pred[to]` is True**
