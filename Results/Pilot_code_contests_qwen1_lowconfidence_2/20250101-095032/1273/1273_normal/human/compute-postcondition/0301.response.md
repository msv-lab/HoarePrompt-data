The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

- `cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element)
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element
- `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`
- `dep[cur]` exists and has a specific value (let's denote it as `value_of_dep_cur`)
- `dep[to]` is updated to be `value_of_dep_cur + 1`

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`, `dep[cur]` is `value_of_dep_cur`, `dep[to]` is `value_of_dep_cur + 1`**
