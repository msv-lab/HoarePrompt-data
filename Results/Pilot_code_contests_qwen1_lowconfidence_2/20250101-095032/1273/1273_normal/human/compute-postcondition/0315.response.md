Postcondition: ***`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `top` is equal to `to`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `q` is an empty list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially described.***
