The code `u, v = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `u` and `v` respectively. This changes the values of `u` and `v`, but does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the list `e`.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u, v, u]`, `u` is the integer obtained from the first part of the input, `v` is the integer obtained from the second part of the input.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u, v, u]`, `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input**
