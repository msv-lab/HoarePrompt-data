Postcondition: ***`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where `deg[dep[i]]` is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])`, `bad` is set to `False`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0; if `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
