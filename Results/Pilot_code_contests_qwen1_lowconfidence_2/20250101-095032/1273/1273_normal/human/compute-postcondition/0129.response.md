To determine the final output state of the given loop, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

### Loop Code Analysis
```python
for to in e[end]:
    if dep[to] == -1:
        dep[to] = dep[end] + 1
        pred[to] = end
        q.append(to)
```

- **Variables Involved**:
  - `q`: A deque that stores nodes.
  - `end`: A boolean flag indicating the current node being processed.
  - `e`: An adjacency list representing edges.
  - `dep`: A dictionary representing the depth or distance of each node from the start node.
  - `pred`: A dictionary representing the parent of each node.

### Initial State
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `end` is `True`.

### First Iteration
- `q` becomes a deque with the element `to` added.
- `end` remains `True`.
- `e[True]` must have at least one element.
- `dep[to]` is set to `0` because `dep[end]` (which is `dep[True]`) is `0` and `end` is `True`.
- `pred[to]` is set to `True`.

### Second Iteration
- `q` contains at least 2 elements.
- `end` remains `True`.
- `e[True]` must have at least two elements.
- `dep[to]` is either `0` or `1` (if it was initially `-1`).
- `pred[to]` is `True`.

### Third Iteration
- `q` contains at least 3 elements.
- `end` remains `True`.
- `e[True]` must have at least one element remaining.
- `dep[to]` is either `1` or `2` (if it was initially `-1`).

### Generalization
From the above iterations, we can infer that:
- The loop continues until there are no more elements in `e[True]` to process.
- Each node `to` that is added to `q` has its `dep` value set to `dep[end] + 1` and its `pred` value set to `end`.
- `q` will contain all the nodes that are discovered during the breadth-first search starting from the node indicated by `end`.

### Final Output State
After the loop has finished executing all possible iterations, the following conditions hold:
- `q` will be a deque containing all the nodes that were discovered during the breadth-first search.
- `end` will be `True` (assuming the loop started with `end` as `True`).
- `e[True]` will be empty, indicating that all nodes reachable from the starting node have been processed.
- `dep` will contain the distance (depth) of each node from the starting node.
- `pred` will contain the parent of each node in the BFS tree.

### Output State
Output State: **`q` is a deque containing all the nodes discovered during the breadth-first search starting from the node indicated by `end`, `end` is `True`, `e[True]` is empty, `dep` contains the depth of each node from the starting node, and `pred` contains the parent of each node.**
