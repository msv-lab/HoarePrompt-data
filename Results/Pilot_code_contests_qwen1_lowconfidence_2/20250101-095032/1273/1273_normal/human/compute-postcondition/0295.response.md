`q.clear()` removes all elements from the list `q`. This operation affects the variable `q`, making it an empty list. The other variables (`cur`, `e[cur]`, `dep[top]`, and `e[top]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an empty list, `cur` is the first element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[top]` is equal to -1, the length of `e[top]` is 1, and the length of `e[top]` is not equal to 2**
