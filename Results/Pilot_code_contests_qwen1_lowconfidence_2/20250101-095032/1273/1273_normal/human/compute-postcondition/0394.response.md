`q` is a list that is being appended with the value of `to`. The value of `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, and `to` is unchanged. After appending `to` to `q`, the value of `q` changes.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `cur` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged, `q` is `[to]`**
