Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states to determine the final state of the program after the loop has executed.

### Loop Code Analysis
```python
for to in e[end]:
    if dep[to] == -1:
        dep[to] = dep[end] + 1
        pred[to] = end
        q.append(to)
```

- `e[end]`: This is a list of neighbors of the node `end`.
- `dep[to]`: This is checked to see if it is `-1`. If it is, it means the node `to` has not yet been processed.
- If `dep[to]` is `-1`, it means the node `to` is unvisited.
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, indicating the shortest path distance from the starting node to `to` through `end`.
- `pred[to]` is set to `end`, indicating that `end` is the predecessor of `to` in the shortest path tree.
- `q` is appended with `to`, meaning `to` is added to the queue for further processing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the shortest path distance from the starting node `cur` or `end`.
- `pred` is a list indicating the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree.
- `q` contains at least one element (let's say `end` is the first element).
- `cur` is the last node processed.
- `end` is the node that was at the front of the queue `q` before it was removed.

#### After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1` when `dep[to]` was `-1`.
- `pred[to]` is set to `end`.
- `q` contains the newly discovered nodes `to`.

#### Final Output State:
- After the loop finishes executing, `q` will eventually become empty because every node reachable from the starting node will be processed.
- `dep` will contain the shortest path distances from the starting node to every node in the graph.
- `pred` will contain the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree.
- Since the loop continues until all reachable nodes are processed, there will be no more `-1` values in `dep` after the loop finishes.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node to every node, `pred` contains the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree, and `q` is an empty list.**
