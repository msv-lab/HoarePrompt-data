The code snippet appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `to` is equal to `cur` because `dep[to]` is defined as `dep[cur] + 1`, which implies `to` is the next node in the shortest path determined by the current distance.

Given this, the updated state of `q` will include the new element `to`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `q` is `q` with `to` appended, and there are no more elements to process.**
