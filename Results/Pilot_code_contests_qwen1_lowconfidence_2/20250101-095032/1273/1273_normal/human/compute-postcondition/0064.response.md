`q` is appended with the value of `to`. The variable `dep[to]` will be either `dep[cur] + 1` if it was not -1 before the if statement, or remains -1 if it was -1 before the if statement. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dep[to]` will be either `dep[cur] + 1` (if `dep[to]` was not -1 before the if statement) or remains -1 (if `dep[to]` was -1 before the if statement); `q` contains the next `to` in the list `e[cur]` appended with the value of `to`.**
