The code `end = q.popleft()` pops the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `end`. Initially, `q` contains `[cur]`, so after popping the element, `q` will be empty. The value of `end` will be equal to `cur`.

The states of the other variables (`dep`, `cur`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`; `q` is an empty deque; `cur` is the last element processed; `end` is equal to `cur`**
