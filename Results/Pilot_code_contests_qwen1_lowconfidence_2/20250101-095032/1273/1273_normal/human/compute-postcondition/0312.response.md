`top` is assigned the value of `to`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it. The value of `e[cur]` is also unchanged since the code does not interact with it directly. The variable `q` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `top` is equal to `to`, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`.

Output State: **`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `top` is equal to `to`, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`.**
