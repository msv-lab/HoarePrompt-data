According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur` and the iterable `e[cur]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has `to` appended to it, and `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element. The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`.

To determine the state needed for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the last iteration.
2. `q` has `to` appended to it, so the size of `q` increases by 1.
3. `e[cur]` must still be an iterable and contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Since `dep[to]` was initially -1, it means that `to` has not been visited yet, and thus, `dep[to]` would be set to 0 during the current iteration if `to` was processed. However, for the next iteration, we do not need to change this specific detail unless `to` is actually processed in the loop body.

State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has `to` appended to it, `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` must be -1 (since it hasn't been processed yet or will be set to 0 during the current iteration).**

State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it, `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` must be -1.**
