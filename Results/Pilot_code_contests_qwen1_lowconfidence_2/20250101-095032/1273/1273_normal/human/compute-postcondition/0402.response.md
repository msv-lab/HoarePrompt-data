The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue `q` and assigns it to `cur`. The value of `cur` is now the first element of `q`, which was previously the leftmost element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is the queue with the first element removed, `dep` is the depth of each node from the root `top`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1`**
