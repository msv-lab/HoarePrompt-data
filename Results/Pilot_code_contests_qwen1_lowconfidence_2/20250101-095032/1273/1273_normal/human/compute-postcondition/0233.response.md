The code `break` does not affect the values of `i` and `n`, and it does not change the value of `bad`. The `break` statement only indicates the exit from a loop or the end of a conditional block, but it does not modify any variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is defined and valid (greater than 0), and `bad` is True**
