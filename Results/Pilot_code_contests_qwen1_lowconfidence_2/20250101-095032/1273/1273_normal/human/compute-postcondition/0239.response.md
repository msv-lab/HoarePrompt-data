The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or the most internal block it was in has been exited. Since no variables are updated by this statement, the values of `i`, `n`, and `bad` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is valid and greater than 0, `bad` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
