According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the deque `q`. If `q` is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one element), the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, we know:
- `dep[end]` is 0
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`
- `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`
- `q` is a deque containing `[end]`

Since `q` is a deque containing `[end]`, it is non-empty right before the loop. Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary for the loop to execute at least one more time.

State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`, `q` is a deque containing `[end]`**
