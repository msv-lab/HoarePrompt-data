The code `e[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `e`. Given the initial state, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u, v, u, v]`. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` are obtained from the input.

Since `e[v].append(u)` appends `u` to the list at index `v` in `e`, and the list at index `v` was already `[v, u, v, u, v]`, appending `u` to this list results in `[v, u, v, u, v, u]`.

Thus, the updated state of `e` is that the list at index `v` is now `[v, u, v, u, v, u]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` is still 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2.
- `u` remains the same.
- `v` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u, v, u, v, u]; `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input; `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input**.
