Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes, `e[cur]` must be non-empty, and if `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` and `q` is now a list with one additional element `to`.**
