Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the last node processed in `q`, `q` is an empty list, `dep` is the depth of each node from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and all nodes have their depths correctly set such that `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` for any node `to` that was added to the queue during the execution of the loop.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `deg` is a list of `-1` for all nodes, indicating unvisited status.
   - `cur` starts as the first element of `q`.
   - `q` contains the initial `cur` node.
   - `dep` and `top` are lists representing the depth and the structure of the tree, respectively.
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes.
   - `bad` is initially `False`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor `to` of the current node `cur`.
   - If `dep[to]` is `-1`, it means `to` has not been visited yet.
     - We update `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1` indicating that `to` is one level deeper than `cur`.
     - We append `to` to `q` to process its neighbors in the next iteration.
   - This process continues until there are no more nodes to process in `q`.

3. **Final State**:
   - Once the loop terminates, `q` becomes an empty list since all nodes have been processed.
   - `cur` will be the last node processed in `q`.
   - All nodes have their depths correctly set based on their distance from the root node, represented by `dep`.
   - `deg` remains unchanged as it only tracks the unvisited status and does not change during the loop execution.
   - `top` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `bad` remains `False` unless explicitly changed within the loop, which is not the case here.

Thus, after the loop completes, all nodes will have their correct depths (`dep`) from the root node, and the other variables (`deg`, `cur`, `q`, `top`, `n`, `bad`) will reflect the final state of the graph traversal.
