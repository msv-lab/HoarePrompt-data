The line `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to the variable `top`. This changes the value of `top` but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a queue with `cur` potentially modified and either `to` added or remaining as is, `dep` now has `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, `top` is now `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, `q` becomes an empty queue and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `q` remains non-empty and contains `cur` with possibly new nodes added. If `dep[to] == -1`, the above conditions hold true.
