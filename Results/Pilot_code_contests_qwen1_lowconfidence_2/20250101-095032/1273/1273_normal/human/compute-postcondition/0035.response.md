Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`.
- `q` is a queue of elements where each element has a depth recorded in `dep`.
- `e[cur]` is an iterable containing all neighbors of `cur`.
- For all `to` in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while q:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop continues as long as `q` is non-empty. This means we need to ensure that `q` still contains at least one element for the loop to continue.

### States to Adjust:
1. **`q` must not be empty**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must contain at least one element.

2. **Elements inside `q` and their depths**:
   - We don't need to explicitly adjust the contents of `q` itself because removing an element from the left end of `q` in the loop body doesn't affect the condition of `q` being non-empty.
   - However, we should ensure that there are still elements in `q` for the next iteration. The loop will remove elements from `q` in each iteration, but we only need to guarantee that at least one element remains in `q` for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `q` is not empty. Since `cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` should still contain at least one element after this removal.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` must not be empty**.
