Postcondition: ***`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `cur` is `center`. For all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` must not be -1. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, `q` contains all elements from the previous state plus `to`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `top` is set to `to`, `q` is an empty list, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
