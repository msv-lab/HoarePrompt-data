The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` by assigning it the value of `dep[end] + 1`. The previous values of `dep[to]` and `dep[end]` are not explicitly stated, but the code assumes that `dep[end]` has some numeric value.

The output state after executing this line of code will be:

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, and `dep[end]` retains its original value.**
