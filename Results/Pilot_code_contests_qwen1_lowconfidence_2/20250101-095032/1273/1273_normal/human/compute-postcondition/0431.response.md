Postcondition: ***`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` with the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q` appended to it, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root, and `q` is updated with the new element. If `dep[to]` equals -1, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables' states.***
