Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists at indices `u` and `v` which each contain the sequence of each other repeated `i+1` times (i.e., `[v, u, v, u, ..., v, u]`), where `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the inputs during the loop executions.**
