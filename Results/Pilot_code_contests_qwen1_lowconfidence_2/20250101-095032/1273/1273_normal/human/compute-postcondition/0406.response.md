The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Given the initial state, the value of `to` is `cur` because `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`. This means `to` is the next node in the tree structure being traversed, and it is being added to the queue `q`.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is now \([cur, to]\), `dep` is the depth of each node from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1**
