According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `to` in the list `e[cur]`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element in `e[cur]` that has not been processed yet. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `dep` is a list of length `n+1`.
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`.
- `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
- `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element.
- `e[cur]` is an empty list.
- `to` is the first element of `e[cur]` before it was processed.

Since `e[cur]` is currently an empty list, there are no elements left to process in this iteration. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again as there are no more elements in `e[cur]`.

However, if we assume there was a non-empty list `e[cur]` before processing `to`, the states would be adjusted as follows:

- After processing `to`, `to` would no longer be in `e[cur]`.
- The state `dep[to]` would be updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if it was `-1`.

Given that `e[cur]` is empty, no such adjustment can be made, and the loop cannot continue.

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1`, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing its first element, `e[cur]` is an empty list, and there are no more elements to process.**

In summary, the loop cannot execute again because `e[cur]` is empty.
