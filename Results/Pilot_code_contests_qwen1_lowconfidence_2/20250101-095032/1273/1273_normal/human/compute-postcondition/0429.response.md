The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given that `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root, the new value of `dep[to]` will be the depth of `cur` plus one. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q`, `q` is `q` with the first neighbor of the first element of the updated `q` appended to it, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[cur]` is the depth of `cur` from the root.**
