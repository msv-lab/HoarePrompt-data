To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the loop continues to run. The given loop is:

```python
while q:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `q` (a deque) is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the shortest path distance from the starting node `cur` or `end`.
- `pred` is a list indicating the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is the last node processed.
- `end` is equal to `cur`.

Since `q` is currently an empty deque, the condition `q` (being non-empty) is not satisfied, meaning the loop will not execute another iteration based on the current state.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to modify the state such that `q` is not empty. One way to achieve this is by adding an element to `q`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to add an element to the deque `q`.

State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the shortest path distance from the starting node `cur` or `end`, `pred` is a list indicating the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree, `q` contains at least one element (non-empty), `cur` is the last node processed, and `end` is equal to `cur`**.
