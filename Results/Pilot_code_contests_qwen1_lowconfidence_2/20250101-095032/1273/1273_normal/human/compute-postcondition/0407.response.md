Postcondition: ***`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is now \([cur, to]\), `dep` is the depth of each node from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1, assuming `dep[to] == -1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
