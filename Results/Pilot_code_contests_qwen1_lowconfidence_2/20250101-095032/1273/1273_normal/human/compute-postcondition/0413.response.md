The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. Given the initial state where `dep[new_to]` is `-1` if `dep[new_to] == -1`, and `dep[to]` needs to be set to `dep[cur] + 1`, the value of `dep[to]` will be updated accordingly.

The initial state is:
- `deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\)
- `cur` is the first element of `q`
- `q` is \([to, new_to]\)
- `dep` is the depth of each node from the root
- `top` is the same as `dep`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `bad` is `False`
- `dep[new_to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[new_to] == -1`

After executing the code, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is \([to, new_to]\), `dep` is the depth of each node from the root with `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is the same as `dep`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[new_to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[new_to] == -1`.**
