The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program. Since the program is terminated, no further operations are performed on the variables, and the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state includes all the initial conditions since no changes are made.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])` based on the condition `deg[dep[i]] != -1`, `bad` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `cur` is printed.**
