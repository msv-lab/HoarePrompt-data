According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to` and the structure of the iterable `e[cur]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (making the right end of `q` `to`), `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` since `dep[to] == -1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`.
- `q` has another element appended to it, making the right end of `q` `to`.
- `e[cur]` is an iterable and contains at least one element.
- `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` since `dep[to] == -1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The variable `to` will be the next element from the iterable `e[cur]`.
- `e[cur]` must still be an iterable and contain at least one element (since we just removed one element from it).
- `dep[to]` will be set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (the right end of `q` is now `to`), `e[cur]` is an iterable and contains at least one element, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` since `dep[to] == -1`.** 

However, to reflect the changes and prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `cur` remains the same because it's the starting point of the new iteration.
- `q` will have its right end updated to the next element processed in the loop.
- `to` will be the next element from `e[cur]`.
- `e[cur]` will still be an iterable containing at least one element.
- `dep[to]` will be updated based on the current value of `dep[cur]`.

So, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (the right end of `q` is now `to`), `e[cur]` is an iterable and contains at least one element, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` since `dep[to] == -1`.**

This state needs to be modified to:
State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has another element appended to it (the right end of `q` is now `to`), `e[cur]` is an iterable and contains at least one element, `to` is the next element from `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` since `dep[to] == -1`.**
