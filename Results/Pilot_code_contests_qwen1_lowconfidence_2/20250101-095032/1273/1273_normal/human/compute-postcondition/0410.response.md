The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Before the execution, `q` is `[cur, to]`. After appending `to` to `q`, `q` will become `[cur, to, to]`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `deg` is still \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `dep` is the depth of each node from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is \([cur, to, to]\), `dep` is the depth of each node from the root, `top` is the same, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
