The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `q` and assigns it to `cur`. Since `q` initially contains `[top]`, removing the leftmost element will leave `q` empty.

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. `q` initially contains `[top]`.
2. `q.popleft()` removes `top` from `q` and assigns it to `cur`.
3. After the operation, `q` is now empty.
4. The value of `cur` is now `top`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`deg` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\), `cur` is `top`, `q` is empty, `dep` is \([-1] * (n + 1)\) with `dep[top]` set to 0, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, and `i` is `n + 1**.
