The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program. This function does not return any value and does not affect any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `deg[dep[i]]` is either `-1` or `len(e[i])` for all valid `i`, `bad` is `False`, meaning there does not exist any `i` such that `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, `top` is printed**
