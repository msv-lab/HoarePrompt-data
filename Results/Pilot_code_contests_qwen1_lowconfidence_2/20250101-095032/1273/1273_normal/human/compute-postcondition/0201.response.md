Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the last element of `q` after all elements have been removed, `e[cur]` must contain no unprocessed nodes, and `q` is an empty deque.**
