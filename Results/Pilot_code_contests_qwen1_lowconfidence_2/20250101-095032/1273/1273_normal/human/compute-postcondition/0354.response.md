The code initializes a list `deg` with the value `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the indices `cur`, `q`, `dep`, `top`, and `bad`, only the list `deg` is affected.

Output State: **`deg` is `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `cur` is undefined or the last node processed, `q` is empty or contains remaining nodes, `dep` contains the correct depth for each node based on its parent's depth, `top` is the last leaf node found or undefined if no leaf node was found, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged.**
