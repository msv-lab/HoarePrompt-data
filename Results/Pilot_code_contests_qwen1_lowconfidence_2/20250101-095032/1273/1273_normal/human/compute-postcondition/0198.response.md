`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the shortest distance from the starting node to node `to` is updated to be one more than the shortest distance from the starting node to node `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the next element of `q` after removing the first element, `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing, `q` now contains its original elements plus the updated `to`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.**
