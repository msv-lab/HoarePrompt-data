Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is the queue containing all elements processed by the loop, `e[cur]` must be fully traversed, and for every `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is either `-1` (indicating unvisited nodes) or set to `dep[cur] + 1` (indicating the depth from the starting node).**

Explanation:
- Initially, `cur` is the first element of `q`, and `q` is a queue with its first element removed.
- The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]` (adjacent nodes of `cur`).
- If `dep[to]` is `-1` (indicating that `to` has not been visited yet), the loop sets `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1` and appends `to` to `q`.
- This process continues until all nodes reachable from the initial `cur` have been processed, and `q` contains all nodes in the order they were processed.
- For every `to` in `e[cur]`, if `to` was unvisited (`dep[to] == -1`), it will be marked with the correct depth. If `to` was already visited, `dep[to]` will retain its previous value, which could be any non-negative integer or still `-1` if it was never visited.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `q` becomes empty or `e[cur]` is empty), the values of the variables will remain as follows:
- `cur` is the first element of `q`, which would be the last element processed if the loop did execute.
- `q` is an empty queue since no further processing is done.
- `e[cur]` is empty, indicating no adjacent nodes left to process.
- `dep[to]` remains unchanged for all nodes `to` that were not visited during the traversal, either remaining `-1` or having a previously assigned value.
