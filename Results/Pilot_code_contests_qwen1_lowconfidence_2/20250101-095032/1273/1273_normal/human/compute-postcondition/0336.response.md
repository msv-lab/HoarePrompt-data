The code snippet appends `to` to the queue `q`. This changes the state of the variable `q` by adding `to` to it. The other variables (`cur`, `dep`, `top`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a queue with `cur` removed and `to` added, `dep` now has `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, `top` is set to `to` if `len(e[to]) == 1`**
