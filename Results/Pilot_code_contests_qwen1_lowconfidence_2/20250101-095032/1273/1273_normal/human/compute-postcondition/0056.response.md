The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`. After appending `to` to `q`, the new value of `q` will have `to` as its first element.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element (which was `cur`) appended with `to`, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
