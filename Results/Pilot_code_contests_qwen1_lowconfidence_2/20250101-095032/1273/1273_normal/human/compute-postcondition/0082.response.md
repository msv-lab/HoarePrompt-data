`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[end] + 1`. Given that `dep[end]` is either `0` or `1`, `dep[to]` will be either `1` or `2`. The values of the other elements in the `dep` list remain `-1` except for `dep[cur]`, which is either `0` or `1`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged, and `end` is still equal to `cur`. The condition that `e[end]` must contain at least one element is also still valid.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0` or `1`; `dep[to]` is `1` or `2`; `cur` is the last element processed; `end` is equal to `cur`; `e[end]` must contain at least one element.**
