The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[to]` was originally `dep[end] + 1`, so this update changes it to `dep[end] + 1 + 1` or simply `dep[end] + 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 2`, `dep[end]` retains its original value, `pred[to]` is `end`, and `q` contains `to`**
