The code initializes `dep` as a list containing `-1` repeated `n + 1` times. This overwrites the previous content of the lists at indices `u` and `v` in the `e` list, but does not affect the values of `i` and `n`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this new list `dep` while keeping the values of `i` and `n` unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `-1`, `e` contains `n + 1` empty lists except for the lists at indices `u` and `v` which each contain the sequence of each other repeated `i + 1` times.**
