Postcondition: ***`cur` is the second element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `dep[cur]` is `value_of_dep_cur`, `dep[to]` is `value_of_dep_cur + 1`, and `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `q` becomes an empty list and `top` is set to `to`. Otherwise, the original state of `q` and `to` remains unchanged.***
