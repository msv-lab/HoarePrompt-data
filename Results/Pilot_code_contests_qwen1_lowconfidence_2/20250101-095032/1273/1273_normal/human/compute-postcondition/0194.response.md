The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the current value of `dep[cur]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, with the value of `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`.
- `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
- `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element.
- `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing.
- `q` will have its first element updated to the next node in the processing sequence.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, with `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1`; `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`; `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`; `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element; `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing; `q` will have its first element updated to the next node in the processing sequence.**
