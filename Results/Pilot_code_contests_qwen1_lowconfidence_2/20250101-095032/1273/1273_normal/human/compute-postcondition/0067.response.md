Output State: **`q` is empty, `cur` is the last element processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node (1) to all other nodes, and for every node `to` in the graph, `dep[to]` is the distance from the starting node to `to` if it is reachable, otherwise it remains `-1`.**
