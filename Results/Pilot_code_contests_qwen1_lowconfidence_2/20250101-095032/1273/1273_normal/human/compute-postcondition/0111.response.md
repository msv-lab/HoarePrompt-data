Let's break down the given `while` loop and the current state to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- The `while` loop is defined as `while q:`.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is not explicitly provided in terms of variables. However, we know that the loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is `True`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `q`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is `True`.
2. **Current State**: Since no specific variables like `q` were mentioned in the "Output State" part, we assume that the loop has just finished one iteration. Therefore, `q` must have been `True` in the previous iteration.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still be `True` at the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion
Since the loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is `True`, the only thing that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `q` remains `True`.

### Final Answer
State: **`q` must be True**
