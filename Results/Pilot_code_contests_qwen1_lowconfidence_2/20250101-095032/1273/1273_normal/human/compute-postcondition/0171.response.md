`cur` is assigned the value of `q.popleft()`. This means `cur` is now the first element of the deque `q`. The value of `q` is updated such that it no longer contains the first element.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`, `q` does not contain its first element (which is now in `cur`), `cur` is the first element of the deque `q` before it was removed.**
