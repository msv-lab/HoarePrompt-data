`q.clear()` is a method that clears all elements from the list `q`. This operation does not affect the values of `e[cur]`, `dep[to]`, or `top`. After executing this line of code, the list `q` will be empty.

Output State: **`e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` must not be -1; `top` is `to`; `q` is an empty list.**
