Postcondition: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where `deg[dep[2]]` is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[2])`, `bad` is `False` if `deg[dep[2]] == len(e[2])`, and `i` is 2, with `n` being greater than 0. If `deg[dep[2]] != len(e[2])`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
