`q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged, `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`, and the length of `e[to]` is still equal to 2. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `to` to `q`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, the length of `e[to]` is equal to 2, and `q` now contains all its original elements plus `to`.**
