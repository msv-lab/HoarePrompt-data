The code `e[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list located at index `v` in the list `e`. Given the initial state, `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input, and `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input. The list `e` initially has `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which contains `[v]`.

After the execution of `e[v].append(u)`, the list at index `v` in `e` will now contain both `v` and `u`. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `e` is a list containing `n + 1` empty lists except for the list at index `u` which now contains `[v, u]`, `u` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the second part of the input.**
