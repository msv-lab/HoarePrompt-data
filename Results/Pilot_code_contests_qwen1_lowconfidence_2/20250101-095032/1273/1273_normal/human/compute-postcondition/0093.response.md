The code `end = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `end`. Since `end` was previously equal to `cur` and `cur` is the last node processed, removing the leftmost element from `q` means `end` now holds the value of the next node in the queue, which was the last node processed before `cur`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the shortest path distance from the starting node `cur` or `end`, `pred` is a list indicating the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree, `q` contains at least one less element than before (the leftmost element is removed), `cur` is the last node processed, and `end` is the node that was at the front of the queue `q` before it was removed.**
