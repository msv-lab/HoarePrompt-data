Let's analyze the loop step-by-step and determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element except `dep[cur]` is `-1` and `dep[cur]` is `0`.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is the last element processed.
- `end` is equal to `cur`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for to in e[end]:
    if dep[to] == -1:
        dep[to] = dep[end] + 1
        pred[to] = end
        q.append(to)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `dep[cur]` is `0` and all other elements in `dep` are `-1`.
   - `q` is empty.
   - `cur` is the starting node (`end`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each neighbor `to` of `end`:
     - If `dep[to]` is `-1`, it means `to` has not been visited yet.
     - Set `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`, indicating the distance from the starting node.
     - Set `pred[to]` to `end`, storing the predecessor of `to`.
     - Append `to` to `q` to process its neighbors next.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, every node in the graph reachable from `cur` (which is initially `end`) will have a value in `dep` representing its shortest path distance from `cur`.
   - `pred` will store the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree.
   - `q` will eventually be an empty deque since all nodes reachable from `cur` will have been processed.

### Conclusion:
- All nodes reachable from the starting node (`cur` or `end`) will have their distances from the starting node stored in `dep`.
- `pred` will contain the predecessors for these nodes in the shortest path tree.
- `q` will be an empty deque since all nodes have been processed.
- `cur` will be the last node processed, which will be the same as `end` when the loop terminates.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element represents the shortest path distance from the starting node `cur` or `end`, `pred` is a list indicating the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is the last node processed, and `end` is equal to `cur`.**
