The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`. Given the initial state:

- `q` is an empty deque
- `end` is the last node processed
- `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node
- `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree
- `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where `deg[dep[i]]` is either `-1` or updated to `len(e[i])`
- `bad` is `True` if `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing the code, the value of `deg[dep[2]]` will be updated to `len(e[2])`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last node processed, `dep` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node, `pred` contains the predecessor for each node in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` where `deg[dep[2]]` is updated to `len(e[2])`, `bad` is `True` if `deg[dep[2]] != len(e[2])`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
