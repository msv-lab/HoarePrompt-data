Postcondition: ***`cur` is the first element of `q` (after removing its first element), `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[top]` is equal to -1, and the length of `e[top]` is not equal to 2. If `len(e[top]) == 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
