Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is the first element of `q`.
   - `q` is the queue with its first element (`cur`) appended with `to`.
   - `e[cur]` must have at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `to` in the list `e[cur]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element in `e[cur]`.

4. **Current State:**
   - Since `e[cur]` must have at least one element, it currently does.

5. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the current iteration, `to` is one of the elements from `e[cur]`.
   - The next value of `cur` will be the next element from `q` after `to` is processed.
   - The queue `q` will now be the remaining elements of `q` after removing the first element (which is `cur`).

6. **Updated States:**
   - `cur` will now be the next element from `q`.
   - `q` will be the remaining elements of `q`.
   - `e[cur]` must still have at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is already set to `dep[cur] + 1`, so no change is needed for this variable.

7. **Final State:**
   - `cur` will be the next element in `q`.
   - `q` will be the remaining elements of `q` after removing the first element.
   - `e[cur]` must have at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` remains unchanged.

**State:**
- `cur` is the next element in `q`.
- `q` is the remaining elements of `q` after removing the first element.
- `e[cur]` must have at least one element.
- `dep[to]` remains set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`cur` is the next element in `q`, `q` is the remaining elements of `q` after removing the first element, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`**.
