According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over the elements in `e[cur]`. Let's analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `dep` is a list of length `n+1` representing the shortest distances from the starting node.
- `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times.
- `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
- `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element.
- `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing.
- `q` now contains its original elements plus `to`.

To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration, we need to consider what changes occur within the loop body and how these changes affect the state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Before Loop Execution:**
   - `dep` is a list of length `n+1`.
   - `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times.
   - `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`.
   - `cur` is the first element of `q` after removing the first element.
   - `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing.
   - `q` now contains its original elements plus `to`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - For each `to`, the condition `dep[to] == -1` is checked.
   - If `dep[to]` is `-1`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

3. **State Adjustments After Loop Execution:**
   - Since `to` is added to `q` after processing, `q` will contain its original elements plus the updated `to`.
   - The `dep` list will have been updated such that `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if it was initially `-1`.

### Updated States:
- `dep` remains the same as before the loop, but with possibly updated values for `dep[to]` where `dep[to]` was `-1`.
- `cur` will be the next element in `q` after the first element (which was `to`).
- `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing.
- `q` now contains its original elements plus the updated `to`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`dep` is a list of length `n+1` where each element represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the corresponding node, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times, `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from the starting node to node `end`, `cur` is the next element of `q` after removing the first element, `e[cur]` must still contain all the reachable nodes from `cur` for further processing, `q` now contains its original elements plus the updated `to`.**
