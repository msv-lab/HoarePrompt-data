The `exit()` function call does not affect any variable values; it simply terminates the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False` if all `deg[dep[i]]` are equal to `len(e[i])` for all `i` in the range `1` to `n`, otherwise `bad` is `True`.**
