The code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to `top`. This updates the value of `top` to `to`. The other variables (`cur`, `q`, and `dep`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the next value of `to` from `e[cur]`, `q` is a non-empty queue with `cur` removed and potentially new nodes added, `dep` remains the same, `top` is set to `to`.**
