`dep[end]` is set to 0. The initial condition that `dep[end]` is at least `2 * (number_of_iterations + 1)` and less than `2 * (number_of_iterations + 2)` is no longer valid since `dep[end]` is now explicitly set to 0. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep[end]` is 0, `center` is the node reached after updating it `number_of_iterations` times using `pred`, `dep` is a list of length `n+1` where every element is `-1`.**
