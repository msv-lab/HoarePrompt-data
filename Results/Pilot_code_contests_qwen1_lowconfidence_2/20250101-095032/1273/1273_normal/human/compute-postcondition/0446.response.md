The code updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to be `len(e[i])`. However, without knowing the specific values of `dep[i]` and `e[i]`, we cannot provide concrete values for `deg[dep[i]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `deg[dep[i]]` is updated to `len(e[i])`**
