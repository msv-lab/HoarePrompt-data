The code sets `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[cur]` is `-1` because it is stated that the current value of `dep[to]` is `-1`. Therefore, `dep[to]` will be updated to `-1 + 1`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`cur` is the element that was removed from the left end of `q`, `q` has had its leftmost element removed, `e[cur]` must be an iterable and contain at least one element, the current value of `dep[to]` is 0**
