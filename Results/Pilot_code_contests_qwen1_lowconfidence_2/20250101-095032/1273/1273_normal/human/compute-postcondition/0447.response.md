The code `bad = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `bad`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `True` to `bad`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `bad` is True**
