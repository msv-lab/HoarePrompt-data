The code `s = sorted(map(int, raw_input().split()))` impacts the following:

1. `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user.
2. `.split()` splits the line into a list of strings.
3. `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer.
4. `sorted(...)` sorts the list of integers in ascending order.

Since the initial state of `n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and no specific value for `n` is given, let's denote the input as a sequence of integers `a1, a2, ..., an`.

After executing the code, `s` will be a sorted list of these integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `s` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**
