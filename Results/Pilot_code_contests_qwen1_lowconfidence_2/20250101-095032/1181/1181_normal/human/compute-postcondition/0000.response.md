The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the exact input is not specified, we can only state that `n` is now an integer input from the user, within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5**
