Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` must be greater than 3
   - `i` is 3
   - `s` is a sorted list of integers
   - `r` is `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   r += s[i] * (2 ** (n - 1 - i) - 1 - (2 ** i - 1)) % (1000000000 + 7)
   ```

3. Given `i` is 3, we substitute `i` in the equation:
   ```python
   r += s[3] * (2 ** (n - 1 - 3) - 1 - (2 ** 3 - 1)) % (1000000000 + 7)
   ```

4. Simplify the expression:
   ```python
   r += s[3] * (2 ** (n - 4) - 1 - (8 - 1)) % (1000000000 + 7)
   r += s[3] * (2 ** (n - 4) - 8) % (1000000000 + 7)
   ```

5. Since `n` must be greater than 3 and `i` is 3, `n - 4` will be a non-negative integer. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can't simplify further. But we know that the operation will be performed on the sorted list `s`.

6. The output state will include the updated value of `r` and the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, and `s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2 + s[3] * (2 ** (n - 4) - 8) % 1000000007`**
