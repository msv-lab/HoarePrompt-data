Functionality: **The function accepts an input integer `n` representing the length of a list `x` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a list `x` of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^9). It first reads `n` and the list `x` from standard input, then sorts the list `x`. Next, it computes the sum of each element in the sorted list `x` multiplied by a term derived from the loop index, specifically \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x[i] \cdot 2^i \cdot (2^{(n - 2i - 1)} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7) \). Finally, it prints the negative of this computed value. Potential edge cases include the input list violating the constraints on `n` or the elements of `x`. If these constraints are violated, the function's behavior is undefined based on the provided code.**
