Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the formula used in the summation is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the value of \( F(a) \) is defined as the maximum distance between any two computers in the subset \( a \), and the required sum is the sum of \( F(a) \) over all non-empty subsets \( a \) of the set of hacked computers.

The code attempts to compute a sum using a formula that does not match the problem requirements. Instead of calculating the maximum distance for each subset and summing those values, the code appears to be performing a different type of calculation involving powers of 2, which is not aligned with the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Compute the maximum distance for each possible subset of computers.
2. Sum these maximum distances modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

The given code does not achieve this and hence fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
