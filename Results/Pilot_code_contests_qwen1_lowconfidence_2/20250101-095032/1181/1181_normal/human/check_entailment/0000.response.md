Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of \(F(a)\) for all non-empty subsets \(a\) of the set of hacked computers. The program attempts to calculate the contribution of each computer to the sum but does not account for the maximum distance between pairs of computers within each subset.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
4 3 1
```

The correct output should be 9, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided program will not produce the correct result.

Let's break down the calculation for the given input:
- Subsets of \(\{1, 3, 4\}\):
  - \(\{1\}\): \(F(\{1\}) = 0\)
  - \(\{3\}\): \(F(\{3\}) = 0\)
  - \(\{4\}\): \(F(\{4\}) = 0\)
  - \(\{1, 3\}\): \(F(\{1, 3\}) = |3 - 1| = 2\)
  - \(\{1, 4\}\): \(F(\{1, 4\}) = |4 - 1| = 3\)
  - \(\{3, 4\}\): \(F(\{3, 4\}) = |4 - 3| = 1\)
  - \(\{1, 3, 4\}\): \(F(\{1, 3, 4\}) = |4 - 1| = 3\)

Summing these values: \(0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 9\).

However, the provided program will not correctly compute these values. It attempts to calculate contributions based on powers of 2, which does not accurately represent the maximum distances between pairs of computers in each subset.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this input and hence the correctness is **False**.
