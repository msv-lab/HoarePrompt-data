You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Leha decided to move to a quiet town Vičkopolis, because he was tired by living in Bankopolis. Upon arrival he immediately began to expand his network of hacked computers. During the week Leha managed to get access to n computers throughout the town. Incidentally all the computers, which were hacked by Leha, lie on the same straight line, due to the reason that there is the only one straight street in Vičkopolis.

Let's denote the coordinate system on this street. Besides let's number all the hacked computers with integers from 1 to n. So the i-th hacked computer is located at the point xi. Moreover the coordinates of all computers are distinct. 

Leha is determined to have a little rest after a hard week. Therefore he is going to invite his friend Noora to a restaurant. However the girl agrees to go on a date with the only one condition: Leha have to solve a simple task.

Leha should calculate a sum of F(a) for all a, where a is a non-empty subset of the set, that consists of all hacked computers. Formally, let's denote A the set of all integers from 1 to n. Noora asks the hacker to find value of the expression <image>. Here F(a) is calculated as the maximum among the distances between all pairs of computers from the set a. Formally, <image>. Since the required sum can be quite large Noora asks to find it modulo 109 + 7.

Though, Leha is too tired. Consequently he is not able to solve this task. Help the hacker to attend a date.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·105) denoting the number of hacked computers.

The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 109) denoting the coordinates of hacked computers. It is guaranteed that all xi are distinct.

Output

Print a single integer — the required sum modulo 109 + 7.

Examples

Input

4 7


Output

3


Input

3
4 3 1


Output

9

Note

There are three non-empty subsets in the first sample test:<image>, <image> and <image>. The first and the second subset increase the sum by 0 and the third subset increases the sum by 7 - 4 = 3. In total the answer is 0 + 0 + 3 = 3.

There are seven non-empty subsets in the second sample test. Among them only the following subsets increase the answer: <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>. In total the sum is (4 - 3) + (4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (4 - 1) = 9.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and x1, x2, ..., xn are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = sorted(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    r = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        r += s[i] * (2 ** (n - 1 - i) - 1 - (2 ** i - 1)) % (1000000000 + 7)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \), `s` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the sum of each element in the list \( s \) multiplied by its corresponding term derived from the loop \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \cdot 2^i \cdot (2^{(n - 2i - 1)} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7)\).
    print - r

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
