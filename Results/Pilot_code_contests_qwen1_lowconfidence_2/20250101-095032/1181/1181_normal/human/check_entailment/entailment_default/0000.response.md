Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the code calculates a sum based on a formula that does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the sum of \( F(a) \) for all non-empty subsets \( a \) of the set of hacked computers, where \( F(a) \) is defined as the maximum distance between any two computers in subset \( a \).

The code instead performs a different calculation involving powers of 2 and subtracts values, which does not align with the problem requirements. For instance, consider the first example provided:

**Example 1:**
- Input:
  ```
  2
  4 7
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The code calculates a value that does not match the expected result. The correct implementation would consider all non-empty subsets and compute the maximum distance for each subset, but the given code does not do this.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to generate all possible non-empty subsets of the hacked computers, compute the maximum distance for each subset, and sum these values modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The current implementation does not achieve this.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
