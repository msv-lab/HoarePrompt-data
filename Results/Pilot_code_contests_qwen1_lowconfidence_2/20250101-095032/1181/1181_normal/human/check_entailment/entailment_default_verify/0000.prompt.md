You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Leha decided to move to a quiet town Vičkopolis, because he was tired by living in Bankopolis. Upon arrival he immediately began to expand his network of hacked computers. During the week Leha managed to get access to n computers throughout the town. Incidentally all the computers, which were hacked by Leha, lie on the same straight line, due to the reason that there is the only one straight street in Vičkopolis.

Let's denote the coordinate system on this street. Besides let's number all the hacked computers with integers from 1 to n. So the i-th hacked computer is located at the point xi. Moreover the coordinates of all computers are distinct. 

Leha is determined to have a little rest after a hard week. Therefore he is going to invite his friend Noora to a restaurant. However the girl agrees to go on a date with the only one condition: Leha have to solve a simple task.

Leha should calculate a sum of F(a) for all a, where a is a non-empty subset of the set, that consists of all hacked computers. Formally, let's denote A the set of all integers from 1 to n. Noora asks the hacker to find value of the expression <image>. Here F(a) is calculated as the maximum among the distances between all pairs of computers from the set a. Formally, <image>. Since the required sum can be quite large Noora asks to find it modulo 109 + 7.

Though, Leha is too tired. Consequently he is not able to solve this task. Help the hacker to attend a date.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·105) denoting the number of hacked computers.

The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 109) denoting the coordinates of hacked computers. It is guaranteed that all xi are distinct.

Output

Print a single integer — the required sum modulo 109 + 7.

Examples

Input

2
4 7


Output

3


Input

3
4 3 1


Output

9

Note

There are three non-empty subsets in the first sample test:<image>, <image> and <image>. The first and the second subset increase the sum by 0 and the third subset increases the sum by 7 - 4 = 3. In total the answer is 0 + 0 + 3 = 3.

There are seven non-empty subsets in the second sample test. Among them only the following subsets increase the answer: <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>. In total the sum is (4 - 3) + (4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (4 - 1) = 9.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = sorted(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    r = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        r += s[i] * (2 ** (n - 1 - i) - 1 - (2 ** i - 1)) % (1000000000 + 7)
    print - r


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of \(F(a)\) for all non-empty subsets \(a\) of the set of hacked computers. The program attempts to calculate the contribution of each computer to the sum but does not account for the maximum distance between pairs of computers within each subset.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
4 3 1
```

The correct output should be 9, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided program will not produce the correct result.

Let's break down the calculation for the given input:
- Subsets of \(\{1, 3, 4\}\):
  - \(\{1\}\): \(F(\{1\}) = 0\)
  - \(\{3\}\): \(F(\{3\}) = 0\)
  - \(\{4\}\): \(F(\{4\}) = 0\)
  - \(\{1, 3\}\): \(F(\{1, 3\}) = |3 - 1| = 2\)
  - \(\{1, 4\}\): \(F(\{1, 4\}) = |4 - 1| = 3\)
  - \(\{3, 4\}\): \(F(\{3, 4\}) = |4 - 3| = 1\)
  - \(\{1, 3, 4\}\): \(F(\{1, 3, 4\}) = |4 - 1| = 3\)

Summing these values: \(0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 9\).

However, the provided program will not correctly compute these values. It attempts to calculate contributions based on powers of 2, which does not accurately represent the maximum distances between pairs of computers in each subset.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this input and hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an input integer `n` representing the length of a list `x` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a list `x` of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^9). It first reads `n` and the list `x` from standard input, then sorts the list `x`. Next, it computes the sum of each element in the sorted list `x` multiplied by a term derived from the loop index, specifically \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x[i] \cdot 2^i \cdot (2^{(n - 2i - 1)} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7) \). Finally, it prints the negative of this computed value. Potential edge cases include the input list violating the constraints on `n` or the elements of `x`. If these constraints are violated, the function's behavior is undefined based on the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
