The code `n = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `n`. The previous value of `n` was `k + 1`, but now it is replaced by the user's input. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`1 + cot(pi / (2 * (k + 1)))` is its original value, `n` is the user's input, and the printed value is `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * (k + 1))) / sin(pi / (2 * (k + 1))) * sqrt(2)` with `iterations` decreased by 1.**
