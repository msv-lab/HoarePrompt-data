Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer \(T\) within the range 1 ≤ \(T\) ≤ 200 and an even integer \(n\) within the range 2 ≤ \(n\) ≤ 200. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the value \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\). The loop runs for \(T\) iterations, and for each iteration, it reads an input \(n\) and prints the calculated value. After completing all iterations, the function ends without returning any value. There is no validation for the input values other than checking if they fall within the specified ranges, and the loop will run exactly \(T\) times regardless of the value of \(n\).**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the input \(n\) is always an even integer within the specified range. If an odd integer or a value outside the range is provided, the function will still proceed, which might lead to incorrect results.
- The code does not handle invalid inputs for \(T\) (e.g., non-integer values or values outside the range 1 ≤ \(T\) ≤ 200).
- The code does not perform any error handling for potential issues like invalid input types or exceptions during the calculation.
- The code does not store the results; it only prints them, so no information is retained after the function execution.
