Output State: **T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 200, for each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200, and the printed value for each iteration is \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\), where n starts from the first input and increases by 2 for each subsequent iteration until the loop stops executing.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each test case specified by the value of `T`.
- For each test case, `n` is an even integer starting from the first user input and increases by 2 for each subsequent iteration.
- The expression `\(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\)` is printed for each iteration.
- Once the loop completes for a test case, `n` will be the last even integer input for that test case, and the printed value will be the result of the expression evaluated for that `n`.

If the loop does not execute, the values of `T` and `n` will remain as specified in the initial state, and no printed value will be produced.
