`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which is specified to be `k+1`. The value of `1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` is not directly affected by this input operation, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` is its original value, `n` is `k+1`.

Output State: **`1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` is its original value, `n` is `k+1`**
