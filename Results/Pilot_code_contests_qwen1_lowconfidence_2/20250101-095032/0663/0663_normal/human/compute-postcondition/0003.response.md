State at the end of the previous iteration: `1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))`

The given loop statement is:
```
for _ in range(input()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To analyze this, we need to understand what happens inside the loop and how it affects the state. However, since the loop body is omitted, we focus on the loop condition itself.

The loop runs for a number of times specified by `input()`. Let's denote the number of iterations as `k`. The state at the end of the previous iteration implies that the loop has run `k-1` times.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `input()` times.
   - Since `_` is used instead of a variable, it is an implicit loop variable that increments with each iteration.

2. **Identify the Current Iteration:**
   - If the loop has run `k-1` times, then the current iteration is the `k`-th iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to run the `(k+1)`-th iteration.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The value of the loop variable (which is implicitly incremented each time) would now be `k`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `input()` should be `k+1`.

Since the loop condition is specified by `input()`, and assuming `input()` is set to the number of iterations, the state adjustment would reflect the requirement for the next iteration to run.

### Final State:
State: **`1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` for the `k+1`-th iteration, where `input()` must be `k+1`**.

However, without loss of generality and based on the format requested, we can simplify this to:

State: **`1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))`, `input()` must be `k+1`**.

Given that `k` is the number of iterations completed, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))`, `input()` must be `k+1`**.
