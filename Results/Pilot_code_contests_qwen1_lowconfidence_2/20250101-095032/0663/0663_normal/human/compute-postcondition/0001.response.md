`n` is assigned the value returned by `input()`. The value returned by `input()` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive. The initial value of `T` and `n` being an even integer between 2 and 200 inclusive remains unchanged unless the value entered via `input()` falls within these constraints. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\); `n` is assigned the value of `input()` (an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive); `n` must still be an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\).

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\); `n` is assigned the value of `input()` (an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive); `n` must still be an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\)**
