The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly from the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints, it seems the function is expected to handle a series of test cases where each test case has an integer `T` such that \(1 \leq T \leq 200\), and for each test case, there is an even integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200\).

Given the output cases are not specified directly but inferred from the constraints, we can deduce that the function processes these test cases and returns some form of result for each. Since the output cases are not detailed, we can only state the input parameters' constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `T` within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 200\) and an even integer `n` within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 200\).

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer T within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 200 and an even integer n within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 200.**
