Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- The expression `1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` is mentioned as being its original value.
- The variable `n` is currently `k + 1`.
- The printed value is `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) * sqrt(2)`.

### Understanding the Loop
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(input()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will run for a number of iterations equal to the value returned by the `input()` function. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know what specific changes are made inside the loop. However, we need to determine how the loop state changes such that it can execute one more time.

### Determining the Next State
1. **Input Value**: The loop runs based on the input value. Let's denote this input value as `iterations`.
2. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the remaining number of iterations must be non-zero. 

Since the loop starts with `iterations` and each iteration decreases this count by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `iterations` must be at least 2 (assuming it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

### Updated States
- The expression `1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` remains unchanged as no operations are mentioned that would affect this expression.
- The variable `n` remains `k + 1` because the loop itself does not modify `n`.
- The printed value will change based on the updated `n` and the new iteration count.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, if the loop is to execute one more time, the state should be:
- `1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` remains its original value.
- `n` remains `k + 1`.
- The loop has one more iteration to go, meaning `iterations` is now `iterations - 1`.

If `iterations` was initially set to `iterations`, then at the start of the next iteration, `iterations` will be `iterations - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`1 + cot(pi / (2 * n))` is its original value, `n` is `k + 1`, and the printed value is `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * (k + 1))) / sin(pi / (2 * (k + 1))) * sqrt(2)` with `iterations` decreased by 1**.

To explicitly state:
State: **`1 + cot(pi / (2 * (k + 1)))` is its original value, `n` is `k + 1`, and the printed value is `sin(pi / 4 + pi / (2 * (k + 1))) / sin(pi / (2 * (k + 1))) * sqrt(2)` with `iterations` decreased by 1**.
