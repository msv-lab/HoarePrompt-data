Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly handles the input by reading an integer \( T \) (the number of test cases) and then reading \( T \) test cases, each containing an even integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 200 \)).
   - The program ensures that \( n \) is even as required, although the problem description mentions that \( n \) is always even, this check is implicit in the loop that only processes even \( n \).

2. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates and prints the value \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\) for each \( n \). This formula correctly computes the side length of the smallest square that can contain the \( 2n \)-gon, as derived from geometric properties of regular polygons and their inscribed circles.
   - The use of trigonometric functions and the constant \(\sqrt{2}\) is consistent with the mathematical derivation needed to solve the problem.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case with a precision that meets the requirement of having an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-6}\).

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs exactly \( T \) times, as specified in the problem description, ensuring that each test case is processed exactly once.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, and thus is correct according to the problem specification.
