Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon. The formula used in the code is:

\[
\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}
\]

This formula is derived from geometric properties of the 2n-gon and the square. However, the problem description requires finding the square of the minimum size that can embed the 2n-gon, not just the side length of the square.

To verify the correctness, let's consider a few cases:

1. **Case \( n = 2 \)**:
   - A 2n-gon with \( n = 2 \) is a square itself, so the minimum side length of the square is 1.
   - Using the formula: \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \times \sqrt{2} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \times \sqrt{2} = \frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \times \sqrt{2} = 2\).
   - The expected result is 1, but the code gives 2. This indicates that the formula is incorrect for \( n = 2 \).

2. **Case \( n = 4 \)**:
   - A 2n-gon with \( n = 4 \) is an octagon. The minimum side length of the square that can embed it is approximately 2.414.
   - Using the formula: \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{8}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\).
   - The exact value can be computed, but the formula does not yield the correct result.

Given these examples, the code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
