Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square needed to embed a 2n-gon. The formula used in the program is incorrect. 

For a 2n-gon inscribed in a circle of radius \( r \), the minimum side length of the square required to fully contain it can be derived from the geometry of the polygon. Specifically, the distance from the center of the 2n-gon to the midpoint of one of its sides (the apothem) is relevant. However, the formula used in the program does not correctly compute this value.

A correct approach would involve calculating the circumradius \( R \) of the 2n-gon and then using geometric properties to find the side length of the containing square. The correct formula for the side length \( s \) of the square is related to the circumradius \( R \) of the 2n-gon and the angle subtended by each side.

Given the complexity of the correct formula, the provided program fails to accurately compute the minimum side length of the square for various values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
