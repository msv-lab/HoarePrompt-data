Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is even correctly. The formula used in the program is designed for odd values of `n`, but since the problem specifies that `n` is always even, the formula will not yield the correct result. 

For example, consider `n = 2`. The correct minimum side length of the square should be `1` because a 4-gon (square) can perfectly fit into a square with side length `1`. However, the program will not return `1` for `n = 2` because the formula used is not appropriate for even `n`.

The correct approach for even `n` would involve a different formula or handling. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
