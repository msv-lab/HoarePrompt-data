Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program calculates and prints the value \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\) for each test case, which does not correctly represent the minimum side length of the square needed to embed a 2n-gon. The formula used in the program is incorrect for determining the minimum side length of the square. A correct approach involves calculating the circumradius \(R\) of the 2n-gon and then using geometric properties to find the side length of the containing square. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment remains accurate.
