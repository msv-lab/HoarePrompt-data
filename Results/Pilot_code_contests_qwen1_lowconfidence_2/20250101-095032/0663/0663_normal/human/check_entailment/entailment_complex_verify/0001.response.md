Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program uses a formula designed for odd values of \(n\), specifically \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\). This formula is derived for odd \(n\) and does not correctly handle even \(n\). The problem description explicitly states that \(n\) is always even, and the provided code and annotations do not account for this constraint. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for even \(n\), making it incorrect based on the problem description.
