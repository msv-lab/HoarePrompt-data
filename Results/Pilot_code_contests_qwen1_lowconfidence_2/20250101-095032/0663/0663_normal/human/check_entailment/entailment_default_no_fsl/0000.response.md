Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the formula used in the code \(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}\) is intended to calculate the minimum side length of the square required to embed a 2n-gon, but it only works correctly for certain values of \(n\).

For \(n = 2\), the formula gives the correct result because a 4-gon (square) fits perfectly into a square with side length 1. However, for other values of \(n\), the formula does not yield the correct result. For example, for \(n = 4\), the correct side length of the square is approximately 2.414213562, but the formula gives a different value.

To confirm this, let's consider the case \(n = 4\):

- For \(n = 4\), the formula gives:
  \[
  \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{8}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)} \times \sqrt{2}
  \]
  This does not simplify to the correct value of 2.414213562.

Thus, the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case, making the program incorrect.
