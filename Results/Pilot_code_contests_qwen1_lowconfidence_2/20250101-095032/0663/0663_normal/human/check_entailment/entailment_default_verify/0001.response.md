Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program uses a formula that is designed for odd values of \(n\), but the problem specifies that \(n\) is always even. This means the formula will not yield the correct result for even values of \(n\). For example, for \(n = 2\), the correct minimum side length of the square is \(1\), but the program will not return this value due to the inappropriate formula. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
