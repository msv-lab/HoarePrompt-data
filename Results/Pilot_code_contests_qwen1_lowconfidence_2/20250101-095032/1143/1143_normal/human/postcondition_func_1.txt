The function `func_2` initializes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) with all elements set to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the global list `l` is populated with zeros, and no other variables are modified or returned. There are no actions performed beyond initializing this list.
