Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains only two empty functions `func_2` and `func_3`, which do not contribute to solving the problem. The actual logic for finding the minimum cost path is implemented in `func_1`, but it is incomplete. Specifically, the function `read()` is used to read input, but its implementation is missing. Additionally, the loop in `func_1` starts from `i` and goes up to `n`, which is incorrect because the frog can jump to stones `i+1` to `i+k`, not `i` to `n`. This means the loop should start from 0 and go up to `n-k-1`.

To fix this, the loop should be adjusted to:

```python
for i in range(n - k):
```

Moreover, the input reading function `read()` needs to be defined. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

# Function to read input
def read():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

# Main function to calculate minimum cost
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n - k):  # Adjusted loop range
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i + j < n:
                tem = dp[i] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i + j])
                if dp[i + j] == -1:
                    dp[i + j] = tem
                elif dp[i + j] > tem:
                    dp[i + j] = tem
    print(dp[n - 1])

# Run the main function
func_1()
```

With these corrections, the program should work as expected according to the problem description.
