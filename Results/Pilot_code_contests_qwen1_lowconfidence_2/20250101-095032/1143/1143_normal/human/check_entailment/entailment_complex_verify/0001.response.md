Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible total cost for the frog to jump from Stone 1 to Stone N. The loop in `func_1` now correctly iterates from 0 to `n-k-1`, ensuring that the frog only jumps to stones within the allowed range. The use of dynamic programming with the `dp` array ensures that the minimum cost to reach each stone is calculated correctly. 

The annotations describe the state of the program accurately and confirm that the program follows the problem description. The function `func_2` and `func_3` are indeed not relevant to the problem, but their presence does not affect the correctness of `func_1`. Since the program reads input correctly, processes it, and calculates the minimum cost as required, the original assessment of correctness being **False** was likely due to the incomplete and missing implementations of the functions `func_2` and `func_3`. Given the annotated version and the corrected logic, the program now meets the requirements of the problem description.
