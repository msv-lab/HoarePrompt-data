Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input, which are the number of stones and the maximum jump distance, respectively.
   - It then reads a list of integers representing the heights of the stones.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - A `dp` array is initialized with `-1` values. This array is used to store the minimum cost to reach each stone.
   - The initial value `dp[0]` is set to `0` because the frog starts at the first stone without any cost.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The nested loops iterate through each stone and calculate the minimum cost to reach that stone from any of the previous stones within the allowed jump distance `k`.
   - For each stone `i`, the program checks all possible jumps (`j` from `1` to `k`) and updates the `dp[i]` value if the new cost is lower than the current stored cost.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost to jump from stone `i-j` to stone `i` is calculated as `abs(arr[i-j] - arr[i])`, which matches the requirement to minimize the absolute difference in heights.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the minimum cost to reach the last stone (`dp[n-1]`).

### Key Points Addressed:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and input/output format specified in the problem description.
- It uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the minimum cost path.
- The logic accurately reflects the problem's requirements for calculating the minimum cost to jump from one stone to another.

Given that the annotated program follows the problem description and implements the necessary logic to solve the problem, the program is correct.
