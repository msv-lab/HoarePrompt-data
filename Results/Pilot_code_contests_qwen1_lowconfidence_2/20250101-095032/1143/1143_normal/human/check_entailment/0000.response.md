Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_1` is implemented, but the functions `func_2` and `func_3` are present but not used in the solution. This suggests incomplete logic or unnecessary functions.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to `-1` except for the first element, which is set to `0`. However, this initialization might lead to incorrect results because it does not handle the base case properly. A more appropriate initialization would be to fill the array with a value that indicates no path has been calculated yet, such as `float('inf')`.

3. **Loop Logic**: The inner loop iterates from `1` to `k`, but it should start from `1` and go up to `min(k, n-i)`. The current implementation might skip some valid jumps.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation inside the loop is correct, but the logic to update the `dp` array might miss the optimal path due to the way the minimum is being determined.

To fix these issues, the code should be revised as follows:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, min(k, n - i)):
            if dp[i] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i + j]) < dp[i + j]:
                dp[i + j] = dp[i] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i + j])
    print(dp[-1])
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints.
