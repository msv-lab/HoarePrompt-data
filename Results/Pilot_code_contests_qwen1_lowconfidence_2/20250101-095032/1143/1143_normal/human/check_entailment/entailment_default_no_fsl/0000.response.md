Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the range of the inner loop should start from `1` to `k`, but the condition `i - j > -1` is incorrectly used instead of simply checking `j <= k`. This means the code incorrectly checks if `i - j` is non-negative, which can lead to out-of-bound accesses when `i` is small and `j` is large.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
10 30 40 50 20
```

The correct approach should only consider jumps within the range `[1, k]` from the current stone. However, the current implementation may incorrectly include jumps beyond the allowed range, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the condition inside the inner loop should be changed to:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    if i - j < 0:
        break
    tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
    if dp[i] == -1:
        dp[i] = tem
    elif dp[i] > tem:
        dp[i] = tem
```

This ensures that only valid jumps are considered, thus correctly solving the problem for all potential cases.
