Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the dynamic programming solution for finding the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N. The function `func_1` initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the minimum cost to reach Stone `i` from Stone 1. It iterates through each stone and updates the DP array based on the cost of jumping to the next stones within the range `[i, i + k]`. The code handles all potential cases as per the problem description and the output hints. There are no edge cases or examples that indicate the program does not work correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the code is correct.
