Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code provided follows the problem description for every potential case. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `arr`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost to transform the first element of `arr` into each subsequent element.
   - The cost of jumping from stone `i` to stone `j` is `abs(arr[i] - arr[j])` where `j` ranges from `i+1` to `i+k`.
   - The function initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach stone `i` from stone 1.
   - The function iterates through each stone and updates the DP array accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost to reach the last stone, which is `dp[n-1]`.

2. **Function `func_2` and Function `func_3`**:
   - These functions are not used in the main logic of the program. They initialize large lists filled with zeros, which are not utilized in the main function `func_1`.
   - Since these functions do not affect the logic of `func_1`, they do not impact the correctness of the program in terms of the problem description.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations in the code correctly describe the state of the program before and after each function call.
   - The annotations match the logic implemented in the code.

4. **Problem Description Matching**:
   - The code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to reach the last stone from the first stone by considering jumps of size 1 to `k`.
   - The code handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description (e.g., `2 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= 100`, `1 <= h_i <= 10^4`).

Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case and there are no examples where the program does not work as expected, the code is correct.
