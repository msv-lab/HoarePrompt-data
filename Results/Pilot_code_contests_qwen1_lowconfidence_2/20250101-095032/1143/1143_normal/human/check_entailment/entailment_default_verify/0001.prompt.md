You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
h_1 h_2 \ldots h_N


Output

Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.

Program:

import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
    print(dp[-1])

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    l = [0 for i in range(10 ** 7)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains only two empty functions `func_2` and `func_3`, which do not contribute to solving the problem. The actual logic for finding the minimum cost path is implemented in `func_1`, but it is incomplete. Specifically, the function `read()` is used to read input, but its implementation is missing. Additionally, the loop in `func_1` starts from `i` and goes up to `n`, which is incorrect because the frog can jump to stones `i+1` to `i+k`, not `i` to `n`. This means the loop should start from 0 and go up to `n-k-1`.

To fix this, the loop should be adjusted to:

```python
for i in range(n - k):
```

Moreover, the input reading function `read()` needs to be defined. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

# Function to read input
def read():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

# Main function to calculate minimum cost
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n - k):  # Adjusted loop range
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i + j < n:
                tem = dp[i] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i + j])
                if dp[i + j] == -1:
                    dp[i + j] = tem
                elif dp[i + j] > tem:
                    dp[i + j] = tem
    print(dp[n - 1])

# Run the main function
func_1()
```

With these corrections, the program should work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : This function creates a list `l` containing 10,000,000 elements, each initialized to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, the program state includes a list `l` of length 10,000,000 where every element is 0. There are no edge cases to consider since the code simply initializes the list as described.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
