Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program as provided contains two empty functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) that do not contribute to solving the problem. The logic for calculating the minimum cost path is implemented in `func_1`, but it has several issues:
1. The loop in `func_1` starts from `i` and goes up to `n`, which is incorrect. It should start from 0 and go up to `n - k - 1`.
2. The `read()` function, used to read input, is missing its implementation.
3. The `dp` array is initialized incorrectly; it should be of size `n` instead of being initialized to `-1`.

The output hints provided do not affect the core correctness of the program, as they refer to functions that are not used in solving the problem. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect due to these issues remains valid.
