Precondition: **This function does not utilize any parameters or variables related to the problem description. Therefore, no precondition can be extracted from the given function signature alone.** 

The provided function `func_3` initializes a list `l` with 10,000,000 zeros, which does not seem to be related to the problem of finding the minimum cost path for the frog to jump from Stone 1 to Stone N. This function likely serves a different purpose within the broader context of solving the problem, possibly as part of a larger algorithm or data structure initialization.
