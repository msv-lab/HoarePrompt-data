#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 100. arr is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4 for all 0 <= i < n.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `arr[i]` <= \(10^4\) for all 0 <= i < `n`, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 0 and for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations. The operations involve selecting an index `j` in the range `[1, k]` and updating `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|` if `i - j >= 0` and either `dp[i]` is `-1` or `dp[i]` is greater than `dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`. If the loop does not execute, `dp[i]` remains `-1` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `arr`. It computes the minimum cost to transform the first element of `arr` into each subsequent element using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index `j` in the range `[1, k]` and updating the cost as `dp[i] = dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|` if `i - j >= 0` and either `dp[i]` is `-1` or `dp[i]` is greater than `dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`. After completing the computation, it prints the minimum cost to transform the first element into the last element of the array. If no valid transformation path exists, `dp[-1]` will remain `-1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not directly relate to the problem description and input/output specifications. However, based on the variable names and context, l is a list initialized with 0s of length \(10^7\). This suggests it might be part of a dynamic programming solution where each index represents a stone, but it's not clear how this function fits into the overall solution without more context.
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` initializes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) with all elements set to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the global list `l` is populated with zeros, and no other variables are modified or returned. There are no actions performed beyond initializing this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not utilize any parameters or variables related to the problem description. Therefore, no precondition can be extracted from the given function signature alone.
def func_3():
    l = [(0) for i in range(10 ** 7)]
#Overall this is what the function does:This function creates a list `l` containing 10,000,000 elements, each initialized to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, the program state includes a list `l` of length 10,000,000 where every element is 0. There are no edge cases to consider since the code simply initializes the list as described.
