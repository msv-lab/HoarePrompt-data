`tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The value of `i - j` is greater than -1, which means `i - j` is a non-negative integer. However, the specific values of `dp[i - j]`, `arr[i - j]`, and `arr[i]` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
