The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given that `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, this value is now assigned to `dp[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp[i]` is `tem`.**
