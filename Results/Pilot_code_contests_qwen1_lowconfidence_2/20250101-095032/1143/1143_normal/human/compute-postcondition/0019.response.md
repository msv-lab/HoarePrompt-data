The code `dp[i] = tem` updates the value of `dp[i]` to the value of `tem`. Based on the given conditions, `tem` is calculated as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if `j` is between 1 and `k`, and `tem` is updated to `dp[i]` only if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is at least 1
- For the current value of `j`, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`; otherwise, it remains unchanged
- `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`

After executing `dp[i] = tem`, the value of `dp[i]` is now `tem`. The value of `tem` is dependent on the values of `dp[i - j]` and `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, but these specific values are not provided. Therefore, the exact value of `tem` cannot be specified without knowing the exact values of `dp[i - j]` and `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]`.

The output state will reflect that `dp[i]` has been updated to `tem`, while the values of `n`, `k`, and the condition for updating `dp[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, for the current value of `j`, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]); `dp[i]` is now `tem`**
