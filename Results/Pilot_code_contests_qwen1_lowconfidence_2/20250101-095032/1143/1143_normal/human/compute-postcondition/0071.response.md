The code updates `tem` with the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. This means that `tem` now holds the new calculated value, but `dp[i]` itself may or may not be updated based on its current value. 

Given the initial condition:
- If `i - (j + 1)` is greater than -1, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - (j + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (j + 1)] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` was initially -1 or if this value is greater than `dp[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

Since the code does not directly update `dp[i]` but assigns a value to `tem`, `dp[i]` may remain unchanged unless the condition for updating `dp[i]` is met. However, `tem` is set to the new calculated value regardless of whether `dp[i]` gets updated.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` and `j + 1` are integers, `dp[i]` is an integer, `tem` = `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless it meets the specified conditions.**
