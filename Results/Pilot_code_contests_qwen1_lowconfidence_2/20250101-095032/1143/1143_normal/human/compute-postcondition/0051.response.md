The given code snippet does not form a complete and executable piece of Python code because it is not within a function or a full statement. It appears to be a part of a larger context where `dp`, `arr`, `i`, and `j` are defined and used. However, based on the information provided, let's assume that the code is meant to assign a value to the variable `tem`.

Given the initial state:
- `tem` is defined in terms of `dp[i - j]` and `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

After running the code snippet:
- `tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Since the code snippet does not include the full context and we cannot determine the exact values of `dp`, `arr`, `i`, and `j`, we will represent the final state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp`, `arr`, `i`, and `j` retain their original values.**
