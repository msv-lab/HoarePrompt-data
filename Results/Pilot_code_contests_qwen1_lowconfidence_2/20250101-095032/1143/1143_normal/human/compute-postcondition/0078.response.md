Let's go through the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `i` and `j + 2` are integers.
   - `dp[i]` is an integer.
   - If `i - (j + 1) > -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - (j + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (j + 1)] - arr[i])` if this value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
   ```

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The code assigns the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` to a temporary variable `tem`.
   - The value of `dp[i]` is not immediately changed here; it only updates `dp[i]` if the condition `i - (j + 1) > -1` is met and the new value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1.

4. Updating the Values:
   - The value of `tem` is now `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.
   - The value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless the condition `i - (j + 1) > -1` is met and the new value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1.

5. Output State:
   - The value of `tem` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.
   - The value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless the specified conditions are met.

Output State: **`i` and `j + 2` are integers, `dp[i]` is an integer, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]),` and `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless `i - (j + 1) > -1` and the new value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1.**
