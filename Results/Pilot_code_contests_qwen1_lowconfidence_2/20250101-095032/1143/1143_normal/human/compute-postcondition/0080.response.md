The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given that `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, this assignment updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the expression provided.

- The initial value of `dp[i]` is unchanged unless `i - (j + 1) > -1` and the new value (`tem`) is greater than the current value of `dp[i]`, or if `dp[i]` was initially -1.
- After the assignment, `dp[i]` will be updated to `tem`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i]` is now `tem`, which is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `i` and `j + 2` are integers, and `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]).`**
