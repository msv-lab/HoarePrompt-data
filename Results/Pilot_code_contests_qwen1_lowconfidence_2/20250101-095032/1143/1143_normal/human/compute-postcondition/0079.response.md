`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. According to the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The condition for updating `dp[i]` is that `i - (j + 1) > -1` and the new value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1.

Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, `dp[i]`, `dp[i - j]`, `arr[i - j]`, and `arr[i]` are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical value for `dp[i]`. However, we can express the updated value of `dp[i]` in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` and `j + 2` are integers, `dp[i]` is an integer, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if the condition `i - (j + 1) > -1` and the new value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1.

Output State: **`i` and `j + 2` are integers, `dp[i]` is an integer, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if the condition `i - (j + 1) > -1` and the new value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1.**
