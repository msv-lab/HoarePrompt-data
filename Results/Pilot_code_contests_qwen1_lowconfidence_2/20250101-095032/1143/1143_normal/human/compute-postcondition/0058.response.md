According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The key points to consider are the conditions under which `dp[i]` might be updated during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations.

For every `j` in the range from `1` to `k`, if `i - j > -1`, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` was initially `-1` or `dp[i]` is not greater than `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**: Initially, `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`.
2. **Update Condition**: During each iteration, `dp[i]` can be updated if `i - j > -1` and either `dp[i]` was `-1` or the new value is smaller than the current value of `dp[i]`.

At the end of the last iteration, let's assume `i` was the last valid index processed, say `i = m`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `m+1`.

For the next iteration to proceed, the following conditions must hold:
- `i` (which is now `m+1`) must satisfy \(0 \leq i < n\). This condition will always be true as long as `m+1 < n`.
- The update condition for `dp[m+1]` will be checked based on values of `j` from `1` to `k`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `i` will be `m+1`.
- `dp[i]` (which is `dp[m+1]`) will be initialized to `-1` and will be updated according to the given condition.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\) and equals `m+1`, and `dp[i]` is `-1` (initial state)**.

However, since `i` is incremented and the exact value of `dp[i]` is not specified without knowing the specific operations performed in the loop body, we generally state the initial condition for `dp[i]` before any updates.

Final State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\) and equals `i+1`, and `dp[i]` is `-1` (initial state)**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\) and equals `i+1`, and `dp[i]` is `-1` (initial state)**.
