The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. The value of `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `j` are not directly affected by this line of code, so their initial conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `dp[i]` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
