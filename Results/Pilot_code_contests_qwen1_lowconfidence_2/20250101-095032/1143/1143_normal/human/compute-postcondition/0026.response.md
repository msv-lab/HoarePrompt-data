The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. The value of `tem` is given as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `j` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `dp[i]` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
