Let's break down the given problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\) and equals `i+1`.
   - `dp[i]` is `-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Structure:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
   - The loop variable `j` is not used within the problem context other than as an index.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` ranges from 1 to `k`.
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `k`, we need to ensure that `k` is a non-negative integer and greater than 0.
   - The initial state of `i` is given as `i+1`, but since the loop doesn't directly use `i`, and considering the condition \(0 \leq i < n\), we need to ensure that `i` is valid for the loop to proceed.
   - The state of `dp[i]` is already set to `-1`, so no adjustment is needed for this part.

4. **Combine the Necessary Conditions:**
   - `k` must be a non-negative integer and greater than 0.
   - `i` must satisfy the condition \(0 \leq i < n\) and be initialized as `i+1`.
   - `dp[i]` should remain `-1` for the loop to proceed correctly.

Therefore, the required state adjustments are:
- `k` must be a non-negative integer and greater than 0.
- `i` must be a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\) and equals `i+1`.
- `dp[i]` is already `-1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer and greater than 0, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\) and equals `i+1`, `dp[i]` is -1**
