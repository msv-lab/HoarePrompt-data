Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are integers.
   - The state of `dp[i]` is determined based on the condition `i - j > -1`.
     - If `i - j` is greater than -1, then `dp[i]` is updated to either `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` was initially -1 or if this value is greater than `dp[i]`.
     - Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.
   - This means that the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `k`.

2. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next value of `j` which would be `j + 1`.
   - The condition `i - j > -1` must still hold true for the next iteration.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `j` increases by 1 each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that the condition `i - (j + 1) > -1` holds true for the next iteration.
   - If the condition holds, then `dp[i]` will be updated based on the same rule as before.

Given these points, let's write the state at the start of the next iteration:

- The condition `i - j > -1` must still hold true.
- The new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
- The state of `dp[i]` will be adjusted based on the same logic as before, but now for `j + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` and `j + 1` are integers, and `dp[i]` is an integer. If `i - (j + 1)` is greater than -1, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - (j + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (j + 1)] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` was initially -1 or if this value is greater than `dp[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
