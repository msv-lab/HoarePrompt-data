`tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp`, and `arr` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain in their initial or pre-existing states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, and the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, and the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
