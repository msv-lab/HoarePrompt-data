The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of `n` integers. The constraints are that `2 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= k <= 100`, and `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4` for all `0 <= i < n`. 

The output consists of two cases:
- Case_1: If `k` is less than the length of `arr`, the function returns a sublist of `arr` starting from the first element up to the `k`-th element.
- Case_2: If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, the function returns the entire list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr` where `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, and `arr` is a list of integers. If `k` is less than the length of `arr`, it returns a sublist of `arr` from the first element to the `k`-th element. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, it returns the entire list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer), `k` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of integers). If `k` is less than the length of `arr`, it returns a sublist of `arr` from the first element to the `k`-th element. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, it returns the entire list `arr`.**
