Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` is -1, otherwise `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `dp[i] > tem`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
