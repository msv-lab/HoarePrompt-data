The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given that `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, this means `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j + 1` are integers, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `tem` = `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless it meets the specified conditions.**
