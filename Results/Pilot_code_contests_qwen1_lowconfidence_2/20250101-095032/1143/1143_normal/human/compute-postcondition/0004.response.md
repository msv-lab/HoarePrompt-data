According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^5\)
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `arr[i]` <= \(10^4\) for all 0 <= i < `n`
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other integers are -1

For the loop to execute, the key state to adjust is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0. All other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `dp`) are already correctly initialized based on their constraints.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.
2. `k` and `arr` do not affect the loop's execution directly; they just need to meet their respective constraints.
3. `dp` is correctly initialized as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
