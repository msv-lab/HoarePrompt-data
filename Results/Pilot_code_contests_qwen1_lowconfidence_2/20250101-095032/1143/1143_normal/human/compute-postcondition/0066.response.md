The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` was previously not equal to -1 and was greater than `tem`. After the assignment, `dp[i]` will now be equal to `tem`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp[i]` is equal to `tem`.**
