Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, and `dp[i]` is an integer. If `i - j` is greater than -1, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` was initially -1 or if `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` is greater than `dp[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged. No changes occur if the condition `i - j > -1` is not met.***
