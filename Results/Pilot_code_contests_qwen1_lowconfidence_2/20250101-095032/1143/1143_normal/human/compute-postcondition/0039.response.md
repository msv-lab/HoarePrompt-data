The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, we know that `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` was previously greater than `tem` because the if condition `dp[i] > tem` evaluated to true. Now, this condition no longer holds as `dp[i]` is updated to `tem`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, the value of `i` is greater than `j` (i.e., \(i - j > -1\)), `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
