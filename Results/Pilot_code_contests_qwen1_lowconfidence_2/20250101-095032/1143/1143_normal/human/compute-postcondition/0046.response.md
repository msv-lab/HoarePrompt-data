The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`. Therefore, `dp[i]` is updated to this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`, `tem` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])**
