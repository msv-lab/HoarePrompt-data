Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If `i - j` is greater than -1, then `tem` is updated as follows: if `dp[i]` equals `-1`, then `tem` is set to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, if `dp[i]` is greater than `tem`, `tem` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tem` retains its original value. There is no change to the postcondition if `i - j` is not greater than -1.***
