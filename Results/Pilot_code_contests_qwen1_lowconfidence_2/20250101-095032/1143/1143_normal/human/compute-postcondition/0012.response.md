The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. According to the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. This value replaces the existing value of `dp[i]`, which was initially greater than `tem`. However, since the new value of `dp[i]` is `tem`, we now know that `dp[i]` is equal to `tem`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, and the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `dp[i]` is equal to `tem`, and `dp[i]` is not equal to -1**
