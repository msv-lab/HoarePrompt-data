`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. Given that `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, the value of `dp[i]` changes to this new computed value. The values of `i`, `j`, `dp[i]`, `tem`, and `arr` are updated accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` and `j + 1` are integers, `dp[i]` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `tem` = `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless it meets the specified conditions.**
