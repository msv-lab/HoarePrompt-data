Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `arr`. It computes the minimum cost to transform the first element of `arr` into each subsequent element using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index `j` in the range `[1, k]` and updating the cost as `dp[i] = dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|` if `i - j >= 0` and either `dp[i]` is `-1` or `dp[i]` is greater than `dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`. After completing the computation, it prints the minimum cost to transform the first element into the last element of the array. If no valid transformation path exists, `dp[-1]` will remain `-1`.**
