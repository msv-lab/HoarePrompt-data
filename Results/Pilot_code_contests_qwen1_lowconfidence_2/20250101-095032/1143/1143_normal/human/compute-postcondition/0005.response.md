Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop is iterating using `j` in the range from 1 to `k + 1`.
   - The loop condition depends on the value of `k`.

2. **Determine Initial Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to start executing, the range `1 to k + 1` must include at least one value. This means `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - We already know that `n` must be greater than 0 (from the given initial state).
   - To ensure the loop can start, we need `k` to be at least 1.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` is already given as greater than 0.
- `k` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop can start.

Therefore, the state should be modified to reflect this requirement.

**State**: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` must be at least 1**
