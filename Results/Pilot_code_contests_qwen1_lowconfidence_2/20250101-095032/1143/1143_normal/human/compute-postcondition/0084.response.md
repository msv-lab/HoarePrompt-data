Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to reach index `i` starting from the beginning of the array, `tem` is an integer, and `arr` is a list of integers. After the loop completes, `dp[i]` is updated according to the given rule for each valid `j` in the range `[1, k]`. If no valid `j` exists such that `i - j > -1`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged and is still -1.**
