Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= i < n`, and `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations, where each operation involves selecting an index `j` in the range `[1, k]` and updating `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|` if `i - j >= 0` and either `dp[i]` is `-1` or `dp[i] > dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`. If the loop does not execute, `dp[i]` remains `-1`.**
