Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, for the current value of `j`, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]); `dp[i]` is now either `tem` if the condition `dp[i] > tem` is true, or it remains unchanged if the condition is false.***
