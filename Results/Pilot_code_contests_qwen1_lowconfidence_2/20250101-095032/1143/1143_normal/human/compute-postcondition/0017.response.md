The code updates the value of `tem` to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given the conditions, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem` is greater than `dp[i]` and not equal to -1. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.

Let's break down the steps:

1. `tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.
2. If `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `tem`.

Since `tem` is a new temporary variable holding the computed value, `dp[i]` might be updated based on the condition. However, without knowing the exact values of `dp[i - j]`, `arr[i - j]`, and `arr[i]`, we can only express `tem` in terms of these values.

Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, the output state is:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is at least 1
- For the current value of `j`, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem` is greater than `dp[i]` and not equal to -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, for the current value of `j`, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
