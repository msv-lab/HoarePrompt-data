`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. From the initial state, we know that `tem` is equal to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The values of `i`, `j`, `tem`, and the condition `i - j > -1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]); `dp[i]` is equal to `tem`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]); `dp[i]` is equal to `tem`.**
