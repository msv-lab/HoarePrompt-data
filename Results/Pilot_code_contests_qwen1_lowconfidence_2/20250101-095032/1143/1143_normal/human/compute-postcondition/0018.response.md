`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. According to the condition given in the initial state, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Since the exact values of `tem` and `dp[i]` before this line of code cannot be determined from the initial state alone, we can only say that `dp[i]` will be set to `tem` under the specified conditions. The values of `n`, `k`, `j`, `arr`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
