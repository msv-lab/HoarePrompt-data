`tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given that `j` is 2, this means `tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`. The values of the other variables (`dp`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `arr`) are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations, `tem` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])**, and the precondition that `dp[i]` is updated if `i - 2 > -1` and `dp[i]` was initially `-1` or `dp[i]` is not greater than `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])` remains valid.
