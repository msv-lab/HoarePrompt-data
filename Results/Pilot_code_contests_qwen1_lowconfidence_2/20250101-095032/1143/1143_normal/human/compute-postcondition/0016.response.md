To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the logic of the loop.

### Given Information
- State at the end of the previous iteration: 
  - `n` is greater than 0.
  - `k` is at least 1.
  - For the current value of `i - j`, if `i - j` is greater than -1, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem` is greater than `dp[i]` and not equal to -1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- The loop condition is `for j in range(1, k + 1)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
2. **Previous Iteration**: We know the state at the end of the previous iteration.
3. **Current Value of `j`**: In the previous iteration, `j` was some value (let's call it `j_prev`).

### Current State Before the Loop Starts Again
- Since the loop starts again, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (`j_prev`).
- Therefore, `j` is now `j_prev + 1`.

### State Adjustments Needed
- `n` and `k` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop.
- `dp[i]` may have been updated based on the previous value of `j` (`j_prev`), but since the loop is starting again, we don't know the exact update yet. However, the condition for updating `dp[i]` is based on the current value of `j` (`j_prev + 1`).

Given the above analysis, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, and for the current value of `j`, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem` is greater than `dp[i]` and not equal to -1, otherwise it remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change in the state.**
