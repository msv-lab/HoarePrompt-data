Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `arr[i]` <= \(10^4\) for all 0 <= i < `n`, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 0 and for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations. The operations involve selecting an index `j` in the range `[1, k]` and updating `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|` if `i - j >= 0` and either `dp[i]` is `-1` or `dp[i]` is greater than `dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`. If the loop does not execute, `dp[i]` remains `-1` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**
