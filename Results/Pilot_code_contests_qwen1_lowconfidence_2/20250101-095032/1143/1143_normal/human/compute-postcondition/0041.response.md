Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), and `dp[i]` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The value of `i` is greater than `j`, and `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. If `dp[i]` was initially `-1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if it is not greater than `tem`.***
