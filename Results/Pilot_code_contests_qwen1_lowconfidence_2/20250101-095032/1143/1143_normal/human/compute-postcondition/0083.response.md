Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` and `tem` are integers. If the condition `i - (j + 1) > -1` and the new value `tem` (which is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]))` is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1, then `dp[i]` is updated to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged. `i` and `j + 2` are integers.***
