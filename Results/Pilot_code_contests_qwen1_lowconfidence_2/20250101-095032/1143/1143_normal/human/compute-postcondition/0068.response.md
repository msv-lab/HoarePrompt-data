Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i - j` is greater than -1. `dp[i]` is updated such that if `dp[i]` was initially -1, it is set to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.***
