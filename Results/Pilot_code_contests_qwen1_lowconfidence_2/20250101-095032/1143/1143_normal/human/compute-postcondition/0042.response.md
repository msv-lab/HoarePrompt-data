Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), and `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations. If `i - j > -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` was initially `-1` or `dp[i]` is not greater than `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
