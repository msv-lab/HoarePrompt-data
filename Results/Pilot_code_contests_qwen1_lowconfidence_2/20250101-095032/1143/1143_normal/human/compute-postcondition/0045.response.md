The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`. This means that `dp[i]` now holds this value.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `dp[i]` is now equal to `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`
- `tem` remains `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i]), `tem` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])**
