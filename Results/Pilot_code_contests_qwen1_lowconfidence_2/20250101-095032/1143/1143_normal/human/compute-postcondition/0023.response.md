Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - \( n \) is greater than 0.
   - \( k \) is at least 1.
   - For the current value of \( j \), if \( j \) is between 1 and \( k \):
     - \( dp[i] \) is updated to \( tem \) if \( tem > dp[i] \) and \( tem \neq -1 \).
     - \( tem = dp[i - j] + \text{abs}(arr[i - j] - arr[i]) \).
     - If \( dp[i] \) was initially \(-1\), it is updated to \( tem \).
     - Otherwise, \( dp[i] \) remains unchanged if \( dp[i] \) is not greater than \( tem \).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over \( j \) from 1 to \( k \). For the next iteration, \( j \) should be incremented by 1.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on \( j \) being within the range 1 to \( k \), the loop can continue if \( j < k \).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume \( j \) is the current value. For the next iteration, \( j \) should be \( j + 1 \).

Given the above points, the state adjustments needed are:

- The variable \( j \) should be incremented by 1.
- The rest of the state (including \( n \) and \( k \)) remains unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself but rather by the range of \( j \).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1**.
