Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `k` is at least 1. For the current value of `j`, if `j` is between 1 and `k`, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `tem > dp[i]` and `tem != -1`, otherwise it remains unchanged. Specifically, `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. If `dp[i]` was initially `-1`, it is updated to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `dp[i]` is not greater than `tem`. No change in the state if the condition `i - j > -1` is not met.***
