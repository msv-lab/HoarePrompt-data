Postcondition: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), and `dp[i]` is updated as follows: if `i - 2 > -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` was initially `-1` or `dp[i]` is not greater than `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
