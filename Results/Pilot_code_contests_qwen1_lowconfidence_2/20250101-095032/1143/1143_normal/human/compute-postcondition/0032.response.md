Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations.

### For Loop:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable Initialization:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `k`.
   - There is no explicit initialization or assignment of `j` in the provided code snippet. However, we need to ensure that the loop starts with `j = 1`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[1, k]`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `j` must be 1, and each subsequent increment of `j` should keep it within this range.

3. **States to Adjust:**
   - Since `j` is not initialized within the loop, it needs to be set to 1 before the loop starts.
   - We don't need to adjust `n`, `k`, `i`, or `dp[i]` for the loop to execute, as they are already provided and do not directly influence the loop condition based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be explicitly set for the loop to execute is `j` to 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), and `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations**.
