The code `print(dp[-1])` prints the last element of the `dp` list. Since the `dp` list is initialized with `dp[0] = 0` and for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is updated based on the given operations, the value of `dp[-1]` is determined by the final state of the `dp` list after executing the operations. However, the exact value of `dp[-1]` depends on the specific values of `arr` and the operations performed during the loop.

Given the initial conditions and the operations, the `dp` list is updated in a way that `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]`. The operations involve selecting an index `j` in the range `[1, k]` and updating `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|` if `i - j >= 0` and either `dp[i]` is `-1` or `dp[i]` is greater than `dp[i - j] + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`.

Since the code simply prints the last element of the `dp` list, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[-1]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` based on the given operations.**
