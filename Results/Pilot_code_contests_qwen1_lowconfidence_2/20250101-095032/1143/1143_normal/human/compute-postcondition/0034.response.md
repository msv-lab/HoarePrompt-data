The code assigns the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` to the variable `tem`. The variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `k`, and `dp` are unchanged from their initial states. The only new variable created is `tem`, which holds the computed value.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to transform `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` using the given operations, the value of `i` is greater than `j` (i.e., \(i - j > -1\)), and `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.**
