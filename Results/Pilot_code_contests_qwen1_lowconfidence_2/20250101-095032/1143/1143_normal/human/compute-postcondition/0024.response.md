The code snippet provided does not include the initialization or usage of `dp`, `arr`, or `i`. However, from the given context, we can infer that `dp` and `arr` are likely arrays or lists, and `i` is an index used in the array. The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is at least 1
- `j` is incremented by 1 (implying `j` is now `j + 1`)

Since the code assigns a value to `tem`, the variable `tem` will be updated, but the values of `n`, `k`, and the initial value of `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
