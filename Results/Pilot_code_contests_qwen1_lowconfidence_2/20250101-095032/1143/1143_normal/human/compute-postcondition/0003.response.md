`dp[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` and `k` remains unchanged, and the list `arr` remains the same. The state of the `dp` list is updated such that `dp[0]` is now `0`, while the rest of the elements remain `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^5\), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `arr[i]` <= \(10^4\) for all 0 <= i < `n`, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other integers are -1.**
