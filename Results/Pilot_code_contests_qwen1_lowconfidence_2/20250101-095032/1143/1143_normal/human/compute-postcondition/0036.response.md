`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`, which is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `tem`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, the value of `i` is greater than `j`, and `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.**
