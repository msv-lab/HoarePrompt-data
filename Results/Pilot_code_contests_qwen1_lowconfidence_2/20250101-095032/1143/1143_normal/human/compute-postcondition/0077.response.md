Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- \( i \) and \( j + 1 \) are integers.
- \( dp[i] \) is an integer.
- If \( i - j > -1 \), then \( dp[i] \) is updated to \( dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]) \) if this value is greater than the current value of \( dp[i] \) or if \( dp[i] \) was initially -1. Otherwise, \( dp[i] \) remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from \( j = 1 \) to \( j = k \).
2. **Effect of the Loop**: The loop iterates over \( j \) and updates \( dp[i] \) based on the condition given.

### State Adjustments
- At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the following state:
  - \( i \) and \( j + 1 \) are integers (specific values will be determined).
  - \( dp[i] \) is an integer with a specific value.
  - The condition \( i - j > -1 \) is checked for the current value of \( j \).

For the next iteration, \( j \) will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state will be:
- \( i \) remains the same.
- \( j \) becomes \( j + 1 \).
- The condition \( i - (j + 1) > -1 \) must be checked for the updated value of \( j \).

### New State
- \( i \) and \( j + 2 \) are integers.
- \( dp[i] \) will be updated according to the condition in the loop body, but since we don't know the exact value of \( dp[i] \) after the previous iteration, we keep it as \( dp[i] \) (the value after the previous update).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` and `j + 2` are integers, and `dp[i]` is an integer. If `i - (j + 1) > -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - (j + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (j + 1)] - arr[i])` if this value is greater than the current value of `dp[i]` or if `dp[i]` was initially -1. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
