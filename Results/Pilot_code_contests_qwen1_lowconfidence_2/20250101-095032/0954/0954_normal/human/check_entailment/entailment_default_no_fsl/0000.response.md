Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_3` does not correctly simulate the shuffling of cards and calculate the probabilities of `R > B` and `R < B` for all permutations of the cards. Instead, it only compares the digits of the red and blue strings directly, which does not account for the randomness introduced by the shuffling of cards.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider all possible permutations of the cards and count the number of permutations where `R > B` and `R < B`. However, `func_3` only checks a single comparison between the red and blue digits without generating and evaluating all permutations.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
123
321
```
The function `func_3` would simply compare the digits at each position and count the differences, but it does not consider the permutations of the cards. There are 6 possible permutations of the cards, and for each permutation, we need to construct `R` and `B` and then compare them. Only by considering all permutations can we accurately determine the probability of `R > B` and `R < B`.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
