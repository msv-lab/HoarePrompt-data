Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle leading zeros in the digits. As per the problem description, leading zeros should be ignored when forming the numbers R and B. The current implementation of `func_3` compares the digits directly, which does not account for leading zeros. For example, in the input:

```
3
007
111
```

Ignoring leading zeros, both R and B would be `7` and `1`, making R > B. However, the current implementation would incorrectly compare the full strings `"007"` and `"111"`, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
