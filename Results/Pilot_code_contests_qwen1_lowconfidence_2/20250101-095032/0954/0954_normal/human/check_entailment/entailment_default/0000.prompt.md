You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cards numbered 1, …, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.

We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, …, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.

<image>

Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.

Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Descriptions of T test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards.

The following line contains a string of n digits r_1, …, r_n — red digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

The following line contains a string of n digits b_1, …, b_n — blue digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.

Output

Print T answers for the test cases in order, one per line.

If Red has a strictly higher change to win, print "RED".

If Blue has a strictly higher change to win, print "BLUE".

If both players are equally likely to win, print "EQUAL".

Note that all answers are case-sensitive.

Example

Input


3
3
777
111
3
314
159
5
09281
09281


Output


RED
BLUE
EQUAL

Note

Formally, let n_R be the number of permutations of cards 1, …, n such that the resulting numbers R and B satisfy R > B. Similarly, let n_B be the number of permutations such that R < B. If n_R > n_B, you should print "RED". If n_R < n_B, you should print "BLUE". If n_R = n_B, print "EQUAL".

In the first sample case, R = 777 and B = 111 regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.

In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:

  * order 1, 2, 3: 314 > 159;
  * order 1, 3, 2: 341 > 195;
  * order 2, 1, 3: 134 < 519;
  * order 2, 3, 1: 143 < 591;
  * order 3, 1, 2: 431 < 915;
  * order 3, 2, 1: 413 < 951.



Since R < B is more frequent, the answer is "BLUE".

In the third sample case, R = B regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.
Functions with output description for each function:
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys, math, bisect, itertools

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_4()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads a single line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each element into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not use any input arguments and relies solely on user input. It handles the case where the input is provided correctly as a space-separated sequence of integers. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer inputs or empty input lines. If the input is not a valid sequence of integers (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function reads a space-separated sequence of integers from standard input (stdin), which can represent either red or blue digits, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not accept any parameters. The map object will contain the integers as keys, with their default integer type. Potential edge cases include empty input or non-integer values in the input sequence, which will result in a `ValueError`. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty map object.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
    if first > second:
        print('RED')
    elif second > first:
        print('BLUE')
    else:
        print('EQUAL')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts three parameters: an integer `a`, a string `b`, and a string `c`. It compares the digits in the strings `b` and `c` corresponding to each card index. For each index `i`, if the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c`, it increments `first`. If the digit in `b` is less than the digit in `c`, it increments `second`. After the loop, the function compares `first` and `second` to determine the winner based on the following conditions:
- If `first` is greater than `second`, it prints 'RED'.
- If `second` is greater than `first`, it prints 'BLUE'.
- If `first` equals `second`, it prints 'EQUAL'.

The function handles the case where the number of cards `a` is within the specified range (1 <= a <= 1000). If `b` and `c` do not contain exactly `a` digits, the loop will raise an error since the comparison relies on both strings having the same length. There is no explicit handling for invalid input types, so non-integer values for `a` or non-string values for `b` and `c` would result in errors.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts no explicit parameters but reads an integer `T` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of these `T` test cases, it calls another function `func_3()`. After executing the loop, the function does not return anything, meaning its return value is `None`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `T` (which was initialized before the function call) may have been modified by `func_3()` during each iteration of the loop. No other variables are guaranteed to be in a specific state, and the function does not modify any global variables outside of the loop.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
