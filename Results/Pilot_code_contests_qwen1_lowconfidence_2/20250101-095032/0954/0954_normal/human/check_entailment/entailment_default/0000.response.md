Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to determine which player (Red or Blue) has a higher probability of winning the bet. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not correctly compare the digits from the red and blue strings across all possible permutations of the cards. Instead, it only makes a single comparison for each card based on their positions in the input strings. This means it does not account for the randomness introduced by the shuffling of the cards.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible permutations of the cards and count how many permutations result in \(R > B\), \(R < B\), or \(R = B\). The given code does not implement this logic, making it incorrect.
