You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cards numbered 1, …, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.

We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, …, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.

<image>

Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.

Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Descriptions of T test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards.

The following line contains a string of n digits r_1, …, r_n — red digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

The following line contains a string of n digits b_1, …, b_n — blue digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.

Output

Print T answers for the test cases in order, one per line.

If Red has a strictly higher change to win, print "RED".

If Blue has a strictly higher change to win, print "BLUE".

If both players are equally likely to win, print "EQUAL".

Note that all answers are case-sensitive.

Example

Input


3
3
777
111
3
314
159
5
09281
09281


Output


RED
BLUE
EQUAL

Note

Formally, let n_R be the number of permutations of cards 1, …, n such that the resulting numbers R and B satisfy R > B. Similarly, let n_B be the number of permutations such that R < B. If n_R > n_B, you should print "RED". If n_R < n_B, you should print "BLUE". If n_R = n_B, print "EQUAL".

In the first sample case, R = 777 and B = 111 regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.

In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:

  * order 1, 2, 3: 314 > 159;
  * order 1, 3, 2: 341 > 195;
  * order 2, 1, 3: 134 < 519;
  * order 2, 3, 1: 143 < 591;
  * order 3, 1, 2: 431 < 915;
  * order 3, 2, 1: 413 < 951.



Since R < B is more frequent, the answer is "BLUE".

In the third sample case, R = B regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.

        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
    if first > second:
        print('RED')

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_3` only considers the first digit of each card to determine the outcome of the bet. This approach fails to account for the fact that leading zeros should be ignored when forming the numbers R and B. As a result, the program does not correctly evaluate the relative values of R and B for all possible permutations of the cards.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
077
011
```

The program would incorrectly determine that `RED` wins because the first digit comparison shows `7 > 1`. However, if the cards are arranged such that the first card is `07` and the second card is `01`, the resulting numbers would be `R = 7` and `B = 1`, and thus `RED` should win. Since the program does not correctly handle this scenario, it is not fully correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys, math, bisect, itertools

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function signature are used within the function. Instead, the function reads input using `input()` and processes it internally. However, based on the context, `func_1` is expected to return a list of integers representing the red and blue digits from the input. Therefore, the precondition can be described as follows:
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers generated by converting each element in the space-separated input into an integer using `map(int, input().split())`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, expecting a space-separated sequence of integers representing either red digits or blue digits, and returns a map object containing those integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers entered as input, split based on the space-separated sequence

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), b is a string representing the red digits on the cards, and c is a string representing the blue digits on the cards. Both b and c contain exactly a digits.
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ```
    #Output State:
    if (first > second) :
        print('RED')
    else :
        if (second > first) :
            print('BLUE')
        else :
            print('EQUAL')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`first` is an integer, `second` is an integer. If `second` is greater than `first`, the program prints 'BLUE'. If `first` is greater than or equal to `second`, the program prints 'EQUAL'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`first` is an integer, `second` is an integer. If `first` is greater than `second`, the program prints 'EQUAL'. If `second` is greater than `first`, the program prints 'BLUE'.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and two strings r and b follow, each consisting of n digits representing the red and blue digits on the cards respectively.
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and `T` may have changed after calling `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
