Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_3` only compares the first digit of each corresponding pair of cards from the red and blue digit strings. This approach fails to account for the correct formation of the numbers R and B by ignoring leading zeros. 

The annotated version confirms that the program reads the input as a sequence of digits without handling leading zeros appropriately. Therefore, the logic inside `func_3` does not correctly determine the values of R and B for all possible permutations of the cards, leading to incorrect outcomes. 

Given the problem description requires considering all digits in the numbers formed by the cards, the current implementation is insufficient. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
