Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the full problem correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that leading zeros can be ignored when forming the numbers R and B. This means that the comparison of the digits directly, as done in `func_3`, does not accurately reflect the intended behavior of the problem. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
007
111
```

In this case, ignoring leading zeros, both R and B would effectively be `7` and `1`, making R > B. However, the current implementation compares the strings directly, which does not correctly handle leading zeros and thus may produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
