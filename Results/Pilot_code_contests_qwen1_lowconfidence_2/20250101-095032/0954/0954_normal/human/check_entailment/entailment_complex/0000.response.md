Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input strings `b` and `c` do not contain exactly `a` digits. According to the problem description, both `b` and `c` should contain exactly `a` digits, but the code does not check this condition. If the lengths of `b` and `c` are not equal to `a`, the loop will raise an error because it attempts to access indices that do not exist. This is not handled anywhere in the code, and the annotations do not mention this edge case either. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
