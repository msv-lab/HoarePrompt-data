Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_3` only considers the first digit of each card to determine the outcome of the bet. This approach fails to account for the fact that leading zeros should be ignored when forming the numbers R and B. As a result, the program does not correctly evaluate the relative values of R and B for all possible permutations of the cards.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
077
011
```

The program would incorrectly determine that `RED` wins because the first digit comparison shows `7 > 1`. However, if the cards are arranged such that the first card is `07` and the second card is `01`, the resulting numbers would be `R = 7` and `B = 1`, and thus `RED` should win. Since the program does not correctly handle this scenario, it is not fully correct.
