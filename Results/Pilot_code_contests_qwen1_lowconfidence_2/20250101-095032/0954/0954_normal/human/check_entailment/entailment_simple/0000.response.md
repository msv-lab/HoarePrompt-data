Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the `func_3` function does not correctly calculate the probabilities of Red and Blue winning the bet for each test case. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The current logic in `func_3` simply compares the digits at corresponding positions in the red and blue digit strings (`b` and `c`). It counts how many times the red digit is greater than the blue digit (`first`) and how many times it is less than the blue digit (`second`). However, this approach does not account for the permutations of the cards, which is necessary to determine the probabilities.

2. **Permutations Consideration**: The problem requires considering all possible permutations of the cards, which would involve generating and evaluating all permutations of the card positions. The provided function does not generate or evaluate these permutations.

3. **Probability Calculation**: To determine which player has a higher probability of winning, the program needs to consider all permutations of the cards and count the number of permutations where `R > B` versus `R < B`. The current implementation only checks the first comparison for each pair of digits and does not account for the permutations' effects on the final values of `R` and `B`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider all permutations of the cards and compare the resulting `R` and `B` values for each permutation. This can be achieved through combinatorial methods or by generating all permutations and counting the favorable outcomes.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_3` function that considers all permutations:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    
    red_wins = 0
    blue_wins = 0
    
    # Generate all permutations of the card positions
    for perm in permutations(range(a)):
        # Create the red and blue numbers based on the current permutation
        red_number = int(''.join(str(b[i]) for i in perm))
        blue_number = int(''.join(str(c[i]) for i in perm))
        
        # Compare the numbers
        if red_number > blue_number:
            red_wins += 1
        elif red_number < blue_number:
            blue_wins += 1
    
    # Determine the result based on the counts
    if red_wins > blue_wins:
        print('RED')
    elif blue_wins > red_wins:
        print('BLUE')
    else:
        print('EQUAL')

# Function 4 remains unchanged
def func_4():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        func_3()
```

This corrected version generates all permutations of the card positions, creates the corresponding `R` and `B` values, and counts the number of permutations where `R > B` and `R < B`. It then determines the result based on these counts. This approach correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.
