#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function signature are used within the function. Instead, the function reads input using `input()` and processes it internally. However, based on the context, `func_1` is expected to return a list of integers representing the red and blue digits from the input. Therefore, the precondition can be described as follows:
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers generated by converting each element in the space-separated input into an integer using `map(int, input().split())`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a single line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each element into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not use any input arguments and relies solely on user input. It handles the case where the input is provided correctly as a space-separated sequence of integers. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer inputs or empty input lines. If the input is not a valid sequence of integers (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, expecting a space-separated sequence of integers representing either red digits or blue digits, and returns a map object containing those integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers entered as input, split based on the space-separated sequence
#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a space-separated sequence of integers from standard input (stdin), which can represent either red or blue digits, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not accept any parameters. The map object will contain the integers as keys, with their default integer type. Potential edge cases include empty input or non-integer values in the input sequence, which will result in a `ValueError`. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty map object.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), b is a string representing the red digits on the cards, and c is a string representing the blue digits on the cards. Both b and c contain exactly a digits.
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ```
    #Output State:
    if (first > second) :
        print('RED')
    else :
        if (second > first) :
            print('BLUE')
        else :
            print('EQUAL')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`first` is an integer, `second` is an integer. If `second` is greater than `first`, the program prints 'BLUE'. If `first` is greater than or equal to `second`, the program prints 'EQUAL'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`first` is an integer, `second` is an integer. If `first` is greater than `second`, the program prints 'EQUAL'. If `second` is greater than `first`, the program prints 'BLUE'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `a`, a string `b`, and a string `c`. It compares the digits in the strings `b` and `c` corresponding to each card index. For each index `i`, if the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c`, it increments `first`. If the digit in `b` is less than the digit in `c`, it increments `second`. After the loop, the function compares `first` and `second` to determine the winner based on the following conditions:
- If `first` is greater than `second`, it prints 'RED'.
- If `second` is greater than `first`, it prints 'BLUE'.
- If `first` equals `second`, it prints 'EQUAL'.

The function handles the case where the number of cards `a` is within the specified range (1 <= a <= 1000). If `b` and `c` do not contain exactly `a` digits, the loop will raise an error since the comparison relies on both strings having the same length. There is no explicit handling for invalid input types, so non-integer values for `a` or non-string values for `b` and `c` would result in errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and two strings r and b follow, each consisting of n digits representing the red and blue digits on the cards respectively.
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and `T` may have changed after calling `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no explicit parameters but reads an integer `T` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of these `T` test cases, it calls another function `func_3()`. After executing the loop, the function does not return anything, meaning its return value is `None`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `T` (which was initialized before the function call) may have been modified by `func_3()` during each iteration of the loop. No other variables are guaranteed to be in a specific state, and the function does not modify any global variables outside of the loop.
