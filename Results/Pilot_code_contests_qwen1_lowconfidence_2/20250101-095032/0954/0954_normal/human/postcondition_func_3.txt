The function `func_4` accepts no explicit parameters but reads an integer `T` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of these `T` test cases, it calls another function `func_3()`. After executing the loop, the function does not return anything, meaning its return value is `None`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `T` (which was initialized before the function call) may have been modified by `func_3()` during each iteration of the loop. No other variables are guaranteed to be in a specific state, and the function does not modify any global variables outside of the loop.
