This function reads a space-separated sequence of integers from standard input (stdin), which can represent either red or blue digits, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not accept any parameters. The map object will contain the integers as keys, with their default integer type. Potential edge cases include empty input or non-integer values in the input sequence, which will result in a `ValueError`. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty map object.
