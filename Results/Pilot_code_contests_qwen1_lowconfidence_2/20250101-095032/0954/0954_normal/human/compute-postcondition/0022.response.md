Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string. If the character at index `i` of `b` is greater than the character at the same index of `c`, then `first` is 2 and `second` is 0. Otherwise, `first` is 1 and `second` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `b` is less than the character at the same index of `c`, otherwise `second` remains 0.***
