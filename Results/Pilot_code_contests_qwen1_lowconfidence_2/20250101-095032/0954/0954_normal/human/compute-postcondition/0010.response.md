The code `second += 1` increments the value of `second` by 1. Since `second` was initially set to 0, it will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `b` is a string equal to the input string, `c` is a string equal to the input string, `first` is 0, `second` is 1, the integer at index `i` of `b` is less than the integer at index `i` of `c`, and the integer at index `i` of `b` is less than the integer at index `i` of `c` after the if condition.**
