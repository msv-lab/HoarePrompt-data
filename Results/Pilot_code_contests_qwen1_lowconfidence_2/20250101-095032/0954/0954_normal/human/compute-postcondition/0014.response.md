`first` is initially set to 1. The code increments `first` by 1. Since `first` was 1, after the increment, `first` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 2, `second` is 0 if the integer at index `i+1` of `b` is greater than the integer at index `i+1` of `c`. Otherwise, `second` is 1, and the integer at index `i+1` of `b` is less than or equal to the integer at index `i+1` of `c`.**
