Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and `T` may have changed after calling `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates based on the input `T`, which is the number of test cases.
- Each iteration calls the function `func_3()`, which could potentially modify the value of `T`.
- After executing the loop for all test cases, `T` will still be within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) because the loop terminates once `T` test cases have been processed.
- Since the value of `T` can change with each call to `func_3()`, we must account for the possibility that `T` may differ from its original value after all iterations.

Given that the loop iterates exactly `T` times and `T` is constrained between 1 and 100, the final value of `T` after all iterations will still be within this range, but its exact value depends on the behavior of `func_3()`. Therefore, the output state reflects the possibility of `T` changing during each iteration.
