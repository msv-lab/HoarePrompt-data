The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `T`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. For each test case, it also accepts an integer `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and two strings `r` and `b` that follow, each consisting of `n` digits representing the red and blue digits on the cards respectively.

Based on the given information, the function does not return a specific value directly but processes `T` test cases, each involving `n` red and blue card digits. However, since the exact return value is not specified in the problem statement, we can infer that the function might return some result after processing all test cases, but without more details, we cannot specify what that result is.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept an integer `T` and, for each of the `T` test cases, an integer `n` and two strings `r` and `b` consisting of `n` digits each, representing red and blue digits on the cards respectively.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `T`, and for each of the `T` test cases, it accepts an integer `n` and two strings `r` and `b` consisting of `n` digits each, representing red and blue digits on the cards respectively.**
