The code `func_3()` is called, but the function `func_3` is not defined in the provided initial state or within the given code snippet. Since there is no definition of `func_3`, the only thing we can conclude is that `func_3` has been called, and its effect on the variables is unknown without knowing what operations `func_3` performs.

Given the initial state where `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), and since `func_3` is called but does not modify the value of `T` (or any other variable), the value of `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\)**
