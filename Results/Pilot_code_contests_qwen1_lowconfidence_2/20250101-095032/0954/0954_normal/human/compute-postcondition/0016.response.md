Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 1, and `second` is 1. If the integer at index `i+1` of `b` is less than the integer at index `i+1` of `c`, the postcondition remains as described. There is no else part in the code, so the conditions for `first` and `second` do not change if the condition in the if statement is not met.***
