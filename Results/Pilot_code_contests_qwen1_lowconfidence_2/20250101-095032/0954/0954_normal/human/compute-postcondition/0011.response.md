Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, `b` is a string equal to the input string, `c` is a string equal to the input string, `first` is 0, `second` is 1, the integer at index `i` of `b` is less than the integer at index `i` of `c`. This holds true whether the if condition `int(b[i]) < int(c[i])` is met or not.***
