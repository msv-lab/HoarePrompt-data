The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

- `a` is an integer representing the number of cards, and it satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq a \leq 1000\).
- `b` is a string representing the red digits on the cards, and it contains exactly `a` digits.
- `c` is a string representing the blue digits on the cards, and it also contains exactly `a` digits.

Based on the given output cases, the function does not directly return a value but rather describes different conditions under which it operates. However, for the purpose of describing the functionality, we focus on the parameters accepted.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `a`, a string `b`, and a string `c`.**
