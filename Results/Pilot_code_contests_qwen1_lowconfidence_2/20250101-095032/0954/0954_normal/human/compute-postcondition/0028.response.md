The code `print('BLUE')` does not affect the values of `first` or `second`. It only prints 'BLUE' to the console. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`first` is an integer, `second` is an integer, `first` is less than or equal to `second`, and the current value of `second` is greater than `first`; prints 'BLUE'**
