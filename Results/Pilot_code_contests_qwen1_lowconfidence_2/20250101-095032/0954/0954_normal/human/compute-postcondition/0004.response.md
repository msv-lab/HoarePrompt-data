According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value read from `input()`. The variable `T` has changed after calling `func_3()`, but we don't know the exact new value of `T`. The loop will execute again if the value read from `input()` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100 (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\). For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the value read from `input()` is also within this range.

Let's denote the value read from `input()` as `new_T`. For the loop to execute again, `new_T` must satisfy \(1 \leq new_T \leq 100\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the condition that `new_T` is a valid input within the specified range.

State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), and the value of `T` may have changed after calling `func_3()`. For the loop to execute again, the value read from `input()` must be an integer \(1 \leq new_T \leq 100\)**.
