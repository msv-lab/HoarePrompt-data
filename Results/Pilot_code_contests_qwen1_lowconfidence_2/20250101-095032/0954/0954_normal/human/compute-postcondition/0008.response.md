Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts no explicit parameters but reads an integer `T` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of these `T` test cases, it calls another function `func_3()`. After executing the loop, the function does not return anything, meaning its return value is `None`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `T` (which was initialized before the function call) may have been modified by `func_3()` during each iteration of the loop. No other variables are guaranteed to be in a specific state, and the function does not modify any global variables outside of the loop.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `T` is less than 1 or greater than 100, the behavior is undefined because the loop will not execute correctly.
- The function assumes that `func_3()` will handle the input values `n`, `r`, and `b` correctly. If `func_3()` is not implemented to handle invalid inputs or edge cases, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
- There is no check to ensure that the strings `r` and `b` are of length `n` for each test case. If they are not, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not provide any output or return any results after processing all test cases, so the user would need to rely on the side effects within `func_3()` to know the outcome.
