The code snippet `print('EQUAL')` simply prints the string 'EQUAL' to the console. This does not change the values of the variables `first` and `second`. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'EQUAL' is printed.

Output State: **`first` is an integer, `second` is an integer, and `first` is greater than or equal to `second`; 'EQUAL' is printed to the console**
