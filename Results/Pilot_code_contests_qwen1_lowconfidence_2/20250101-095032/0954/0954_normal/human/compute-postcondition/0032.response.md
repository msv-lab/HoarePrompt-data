Postcondition: ***`first` is an integer, `second` is an integer. If `first` is greater than `second`, the program prints 'EQUAL'. If `second` is greater than `first`, the program prints 'BLUE'.***

This postcondition covers both cases of the if and else parts, summarizing the overall state of the program variables after the if-else block executes.
