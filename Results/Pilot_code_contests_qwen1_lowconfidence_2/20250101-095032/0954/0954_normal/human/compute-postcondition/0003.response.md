The function `func_3()` is called, but its implementation is not provided. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables. However, we know that `T` is initially an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and the input value is 1. Calling `func_3()` could potentially modify `T` or introduce new variables, but without knowing the function's implementation, we can only state that `T` may have been modified by the function.

Given the initial state and the fact that `func_3()` could modify `T`, the most accurate representation of the output state is that `T` may now have a value between 1 and 100, inclusive, which could be different from its original value.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), and the value of `T` may have changed after calling `func_3()`.**
