`second` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 or 1 (depending on the initial state) to 1 or 2. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `first`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 1, `second` is 1 or 2**
