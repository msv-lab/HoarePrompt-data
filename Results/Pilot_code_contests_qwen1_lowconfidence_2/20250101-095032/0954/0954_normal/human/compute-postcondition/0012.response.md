Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 1, `second` is 0 if the integer at index `i` of `b` is greater than the integer at index `i` of `c`. Otherwise, `first` is 0, `second` is 1, and the integer at index `i` of `b` is less than or equal to the integer at index `i` of `c`.***
