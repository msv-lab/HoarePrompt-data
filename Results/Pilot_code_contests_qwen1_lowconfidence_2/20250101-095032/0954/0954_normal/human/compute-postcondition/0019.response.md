`first` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `first` is 1, so it becomes 2. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `a` must be greater than 1, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 2, and `second` is 0.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 1, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 2, and `second` is 0**
