The value of `second` is incremented by 1. Initially, `second` is 0, so it becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `first`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must be greater than 1, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 1, and `second` is 1.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 1, `b` and `c` are strings equal to the input string, `first` is 1, and `second` is 1**
