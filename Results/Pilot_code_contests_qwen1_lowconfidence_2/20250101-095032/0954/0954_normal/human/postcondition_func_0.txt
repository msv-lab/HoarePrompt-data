The function `func_1` reads a single line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each element into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not use any input arguments and relies solely on user input. It handles the case where the input is provided correctly as a space-separated sequence of integers. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer inputs or empty input lines. If the input is not a valid sequence of integers (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`.
