Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initial Assumptions and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the inputs `s` and `t` as lists of characters.
   - It calculates the character counts in both `s` and `t`.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `s` is lexicographically greater than `t`. If `s` is already lexicographically greater, it directly returns `s` if `len(s) != len(t)`, which is incorrect because `s` should be the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t`.

3. **Finding the First Character to Swap:**
   - The program tries to find the first character in `s` that is smaller than the corresponding character in `t`. However, this approach is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that changing just one character to the next available character is sufficient to make `s` lexicographically greater than `t`. 

4. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The program constructs the result string by ensuring that the new string is the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where rearranging the entire string might be necessary to ensure it is lexicographically greater than `t`.

### Specific Issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Character to Change:**
   - The logic to find the first character in `s` that is smaller than the corresponding character in `t` and then replacing it with the next available character does not guarantee that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest one that is greater than `t`. 

2. **Handling Different Lengths:**
   - The program does not handle cases where `s` is shorter than `t`. In such cases, it incorrectly returns `-1` even though a valid solution might exist by appending characters to `s`.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when `s` and `t` have different lengths or when `s` needs to be extended by adding characters to meet the lexicographical requirement.

### Example Cases:

- **Case 1: `s = "abc"` and `t = "defg"`**
  - The program should return `-1` because no permutation of `s` can be lexicographically greater than `t`.

- **Case 2: `s = "abad"` and `t = "bob"`**
  - The program should return `daab` because `daab` is the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
