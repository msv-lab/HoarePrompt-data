Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to generate the lexicographically minimum string that is strictly greater than `t` in some scenarios.

Consider the following example:
Input:
```
abc
cba
```

Expected Output:
```
acb
```

However, the program outputs:
```
abc
```

This happens because the program does not correctly find the smallest possible permutation of `s` that is lexicographically greater than `t`. The program attempts to find the smallest index `i` where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, but it fails to handle cases where no such index exists, or where the required permutation involves rearranging characters to form the lexicographically smallest string greater than `t`.

To illustrate, the program does not consider the scenario where the smallest valid permutation starts after the point where `s` and `t` match character-wise. For instance, in the input "abc" and "cba", the program should swap 'a' and 'b' to get "acb", which is the smallest permutation of "abc" that is lexicographically greater than "cba".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
