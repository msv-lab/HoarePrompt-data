You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everything got unclear to us in a far away constellation Tau Ceti. Specifically, the Taucetians choose names to their children in a very peculiar manner.

Two young parents abac and bbad think what name to give to their first-born child. They decided that the name will be the permutation of letters of string s. To keep up with the neighbours, they decided to call the baby so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t.

On the other hand, they suspect that a name tax will be introduced shortly. According to it, the Taucetians with lexicographically larger names will pay larger taxes. That's the reason abac and bbad want to call the newborn so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than name t and lexicographically minimum at that.

The lexicographical order of strings is the order we are all used to, the "dictionary" order. Such comparison is used in all modern programming languages to compare strings. Formally, a string p of length n is lexicographically less than string q of length m, if one of the two statements is correct:

  * n < m, and p is the beginning (prefix) of string q (for example, "aba" is less than string "abaa"), 
  * p1 = q1, p2 = q2, ..., pk - 1 = qk - 1, pk < qk for some k (1 ≤ k ≤ min(n, m)), here characters in strings are numbered starting from 1. 



Write a program that, given string s and the heighbours' child's name t determines the string that is the result of permutation of letters in s. The string should be lexicographically strictly more than t and also, lexicographically minimum.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000), where |s| is its length. The second line contains a non-empty string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000), where |t| is its length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the sought name or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples

Input

aad
aac


Output

aad


Input

abad
bob


Output

daab


Input

abc
defg


Output

-1


Input

czaaab
abcdef


Output

abczaa

Note

In the first sample the given string s is the sought one, consequently, we do not need to change the letter order there.
Program:
```
print(func_1())

def func_1():
    s = list(raw_input())
    t = list(raw_input())
    scount = [0] * 26
    tcount = [0] * 26
    for char in s:
        scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    for char in t:
        tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    allgreater = True
    for i in range(26):
        if scount[i] < tcount[i]:
            allgreater = False
    if allgreater:
        if len(s) == len(t):
            return -1
        for char in t:
            scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
        for i in range(26):
            while scount[i] > 0:
                t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
                scount[i] -= 1
        return ''.join(map(str, t))
    works = -1
    scountcopy = list(scount)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        cando = False
        for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
            if scountcopy[j] > 0:
                cando = True
        if cando:
            works = i
        if scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0:
            break
        scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    if works == -1:
        return -1
    res = list()
    for i in range(works):
        res.append(t[i])
        scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
        if scount[j] > 0:
            res.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
            scount[j] -= 1
            break
    for i in range(26):
        while scount[i] > 0:
            res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
            scount[i] -= 1
    return ''.join(map(str, res))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
