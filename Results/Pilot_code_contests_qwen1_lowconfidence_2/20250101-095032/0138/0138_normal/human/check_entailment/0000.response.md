Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string `s` cannot be permuted to be lexicographically strictly greater than `t`. Specifically, the program does not check if it's possible to make a permutation of `s` that is lexicographically greater than `t`. Here's an example to illustrate this:

Given:
```
s = "abc"
t = "cba"
```

Expected output: `-1` because no permutation of `s` can be lexicographically greater than `t`.

However, the current implementation does not check for this condition. It assumes that if it can place a character greater than the corresponding character in `t`, then the permutation is valid. This assumption is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that the resulting permutation will be the smallest one that is still lexicographically greater than `t`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after finding the first position where it can place a character greater than the corresponding character in `t`, it checks if the remaining characters in `s` can still form a lexicographically minimum string that is greater than `t`.
