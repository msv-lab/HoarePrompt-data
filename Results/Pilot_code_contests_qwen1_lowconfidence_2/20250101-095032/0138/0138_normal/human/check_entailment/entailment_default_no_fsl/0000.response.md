Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the resulting string is lexicographically minimum among all strings that are lexicographically greater than `t`. Here are the issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not properly handle the case where no valid permutation exists that is lexicographically greater than `t`. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   Input:
   czaaab
   abcdef
   ```
   The code incorrectly returns `abczaa` instead of `-1` because no permutation of `czaaab` is lexicographically greater than `abcdef`.

2. **Minimum Lexicographic Permutation**: The code attempts to construct a string that meets the criteria but does not guarantee that it is the lexicographically minimum such string. For instance, in the input:
   ```
   Input:
   abad
   bob
   ```
   The correct output should be `daab`, but the code outputs `daab` which is correct, but this does not cover all edge cases.

3. **Character Count Mismatch**: The code does not properly handle cases where the character counts in `s` and `t` are mismatched in a way that prevents forming a valid result. For example, consider:
   ```
   Input:
   abc
   defg
   ```
   The correct output should be `-1` since no permutation of `abc` can be lexicographically greater than `defg`, but the code does not handle this case correctly.

To fix these issues, the code needs to ensure that it finds the lexicographically minimum string that is greater than `t`. This requires a more sophisticated approach, such as constructing the string character by character while ensuring the lexicographical order is maintained and the resulting string is the smallest possible.
