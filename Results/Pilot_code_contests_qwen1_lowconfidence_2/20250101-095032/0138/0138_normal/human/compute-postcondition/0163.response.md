The code `break` is used to exit a loop or match case, but since there is no loop or match case in the given snippet, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`cando` is True; `t[works]` is the last character checked; `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \); `res` includes the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`; `scount[j]` is decremented by 1**
