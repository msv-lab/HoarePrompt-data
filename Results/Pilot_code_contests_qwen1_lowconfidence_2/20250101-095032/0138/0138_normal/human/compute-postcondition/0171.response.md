Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `cando` is True.
   - `t[works]` is the last character checked.
   - `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions.
   - `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are either zero or decreased by one during the loop executions.
   - `works` remains the same.
   - `j` is the last value assigned within the loop.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(26)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to 25.
   - For each iteration, `i` will be compared against the length of the alphabet (26).

3. **Key Variables and Their Constraints:**
   - Since `i` ranges from 0 to 25, the loop will always execute as long as the condition `i < 26` holds true.
   - There are no direct constraints on `cando`, `t[works]`, `res`, `scount`, or `works` that prevent the loop from executing; they are more related to what happens inside the loop rather than the loop itself.
   - The variable `j` is mentioned to be the last value assigned within the loop, but its specific value doesn't directly affect the loopâ€™s execution as long as the loop iterates correctly.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop will always execute for `i` in `range(26)`, the initial states do not need to be modified to ensure the loop starts.
   - However, we should ensure that the loop will iterate correctly without assumptions about internal changes to variables like `j`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes are minimal and only focus on ensuring the loop's condition is met, which it inherently is since it iterates from 0 to 25.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions, `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are either zero or decreased by one during the loop executions, `works` remains the same, and `j` is the last value assigned within the loop.**
