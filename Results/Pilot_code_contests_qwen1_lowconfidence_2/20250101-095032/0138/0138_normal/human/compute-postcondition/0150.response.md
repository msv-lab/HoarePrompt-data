According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `works`. The loop will continue as long as `i < works`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `len(s) > 0`
- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-2`
- `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`
- `works` is `2`

The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = works - 1`. Since `works` is currently `2`, the loop will run for `i = 0` and `i = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `1` and the loop will then run for `i = 2`.

So, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as it was part of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `len(s) > 0`
- `cando` remains `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` remains `-2`
- `res` remains `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`
- `works` remains `2`
- `i` will be `2`

State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-2`, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`, `works` is `2`, `i` is `2`**
