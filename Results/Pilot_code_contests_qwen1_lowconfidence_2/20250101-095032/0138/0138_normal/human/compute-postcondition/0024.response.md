The variable `allgreater` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is to the `allgreater` variable.

Output State: **`t` is a list of characters, `char` is the last character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 elements where the index corresponding to `char` is now the length of `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `i` is 0, and `scount[0]` is either less than `tcount[0]` or does not exist**
