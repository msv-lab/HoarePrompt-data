Functionality: The function `func_1` takes two non-empty strings `s` and `t` as input and returns a string based on specific conditions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the function's behavior and its final state:

1. The function converts the input strings `s` and `t` into lists of characters.
2. It then counts the occurrences of each character in both strings `s` and `t` using the arrays `scount` and `tcount`, respectively.
3. It checks if the character count in `s` is less than or equal to the character count in `t` for every character from 'a' to 'z'. If this condition is met and the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal, it returns `-1`.
4. If the above condition fails, it decrements the `scount` array by the values in `tcount`.
5. It appends characters from 'a' to 'z' to the list `t` based on the remaining counts in `scount`, resulting in the list `t` being filled with the required characters to match the character counts in `s`.
6. It then attempts to find the smallest index `works` in `s` where a character can still be replaced by another character from `t` without violating the character count constraints. If no such index is found, it returns `-1`.
7. If an index `works` is found, it constructs the resulting string `res` by taking the first `works` characters from `t` and appending characters from 'a' to 'z' as necessary to meet the character count requirements.
8. Finally, it returns the constructed string `res`.

The function handles several edge cases:
- If the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal and the character counts do not satisfy the condition, it returns `-1`.
- If no valid replacement can be made, it also returns `-1`.
- In a special case, if the function constructs an empty string `t` and fills it with the character 'z', it returns the string `'z'`.

Thus, the final state of the program after executing `func_1` depends on the input strings `s` and `t` and the internal character count conditions, potentially returning `-1`, the string `'z'`, or a custom string `res` that meets the specified character count criteria.
