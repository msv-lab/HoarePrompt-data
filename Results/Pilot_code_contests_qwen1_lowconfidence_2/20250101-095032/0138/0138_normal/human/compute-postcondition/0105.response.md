Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `len(s) > 0`: The string `s` is non-empty.
   - `cando` is `True`: The condition `cando` is satisfied.
   - `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter: The character `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter.
   - `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0: The count of the character `t[i + 1]` in `scountcopy` is zero.
   - `works` is equal to `i + 1`: The variable `works` holds the value `i + 1`.
   - There exists at least one index `j` such that `scountcopy[j] > 0`: There is at least one character in `s` that appears more than once.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (since `range(start, stop)` stops before `stop`).
   - Each iteration of the loop checks the count of each character from `t[i]` onwards in the alphabet (`'a'` to `'z'`).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the specified range and `scountcopy[j] == 0`. Once `scountcopy[j]` becomes greater than 0, the loop will terminate.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be in the range and `scountcopy[j]` must still be 0.

Given these points, let's determine the necessary adjustments:

- Since `j` starts from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` and goes up to 25, the initial value of `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `scountcopy[j] == 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be in the range and `scountcopy[j]` must still be 0.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be set to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` (or the next valid value if the current value has already been checked).
- `scountcopy[j]` must still be 0.

**State:**
**`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is equal to `i + 1`, and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1]` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute one more time with `j` starting from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` and checking the next character until it finds a character with a count greater than 0 or reaches the end of the alphabet.
