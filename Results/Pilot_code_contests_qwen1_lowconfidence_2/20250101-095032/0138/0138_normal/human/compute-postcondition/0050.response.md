`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, `scount[0]` is decreased by 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `scount[0]` is one less than its original value (still greater than 0); `t` is a list containing ['a', 'a'].

Output State: **`i` is 0; `scount[0]` is one less than its original value (still greater than 0); `t` is a list containing ['a', 'a']**
