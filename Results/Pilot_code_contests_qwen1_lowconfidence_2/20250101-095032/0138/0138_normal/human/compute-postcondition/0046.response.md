The code appends a character to the list `t`. The character appended is calculated as `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the character appended will be `'a'`. The variables `scount` and its initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `scount[0]` is greater than 1, `t` is a list containing ['a']**
