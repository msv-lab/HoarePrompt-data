The line `cando = True` simply reassigns the variable `cando` to the boolean value `True`. Since the initial state already had `cando` as `True`, this assignment does not change the value of `cando`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(s)` is greater than 0; `cando` is True; `t[i]` is a lowercase letter; `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 3]` is greater than 0**
