`scount[i]` is decremented by 1, which means `scount[i]` becomes `scount[i] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `prev_i + 1`, `scount[i]` is `scount[i] - 1`, `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0, `t` contains all the characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each positive `scount[i]` where the loop executed plus the new character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`**
