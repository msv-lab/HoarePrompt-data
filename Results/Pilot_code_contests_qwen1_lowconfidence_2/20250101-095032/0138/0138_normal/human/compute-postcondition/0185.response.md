`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is equal to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `'d'`, `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, `works` remains the same, `j` is 1 more than `j_last`, `scount[3]` is 1, `scount[i]` is decreased by 1 where `i` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`**
