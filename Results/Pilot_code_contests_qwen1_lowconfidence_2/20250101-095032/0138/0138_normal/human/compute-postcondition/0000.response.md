`s` is a list containing the characters of the original string `s` (since `list(raw_input())` converts the input string into a list of characters). The variable `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with lengths satisfying 1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with lengths satisfying 1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000.**
