The code appends a character to the list `res`. The character appended is determined by converting the value of `i` to a character in the alphabet starting from 'a'. Since `i` is not specified directly in the code, we infer that `i` is updated to the next character in the sequence based on the previous state.

From the initial state:
- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero
- `works` remains the same
- `j` is incremented from its last value `j_last`
- `scount[2]` is `1`

Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the code but is inferred to be the next character in the alphabet, we can deduce that `i` was previously `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and now it is incremented to the next value, which would be `i + 1`.

Let's denote the character corresponding to `i` as `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given that `scount[2]` was `1` and now it is `0` (since it is incremented by 1 in the range calculation), we can infer that `i` was `2` and is now `3`.

Therefore, the character appended to `res` is `chr(3 + ord('a'))`, which is `'d'`.

Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `'d'`, `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, `works` remains the same, `j` is 1 more than `j_last`, `scount[3]` is 1**
