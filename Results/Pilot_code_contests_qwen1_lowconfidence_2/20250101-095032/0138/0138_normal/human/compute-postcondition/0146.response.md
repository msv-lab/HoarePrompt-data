`scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is equal to `works`, the variable `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is updated. According to the initial state, `scountcopy[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `0`. Since `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is being updated from `0` (as per the initial state of `scountcopy`), the new value of `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` will be `-1`.

All other variables remain unchanged based on the given code snippet.

Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-1`, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`, `works` must be at least 1**
