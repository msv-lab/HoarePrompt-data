The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \) and \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 < 26 \). This means `j` is a value between 1 and 25 (inclusive).

The value of `res` is updated by appending the character calculated from `j`. Since `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \), the character appended will be the next letter in the alphabet after `j_{\text{prev}}`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `cando` remains `True`
- `t[works]` remains the last character checked
- `j` remains \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \)
- `res` now includes the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`

Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \), and `res` includes the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`.**
