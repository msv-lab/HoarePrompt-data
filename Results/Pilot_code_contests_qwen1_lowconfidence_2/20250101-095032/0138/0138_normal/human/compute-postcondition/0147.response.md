Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `len(s) > 0`: This means the string `s` is non-empty.
   - `cando` is `True`: This means the condition to continue the loop is met.
   - `t[works]` is the last character checked: This means we know the value of the character at position `works` in the string `t`.
   - `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-1`: This means the count of the character `t[works]` in the string `s` is not yet determined.
   - `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`: This means the result list `res` contains characters from `t` up to the position `works-1`.
   - `works` must be at least 1: This means `works` is currently 1 or more.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(works)`. This means it will run from `0` to `works-1`.

3. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` ranges from `0` to `works-1`, after each iteration, `i` increases by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i+1`.
   - The condition `cando` must remain `True` for the loop to continue.
   - The character `t[works]` remains the same since it is outside the loop.
   - The count `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` remains `-1` because the loop does not affect this count directly.
   - The result list `res` will include the character `t[i]` in each iteration. After the loop, `res` will be `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[i]]`.
   - `works` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.

4. **Next Iteration Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `cando` must still be `True`.
   - `works` must be at least 2 (since it starts from 1 and increases by 1 each iteration).

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be `0` in the first iteration, then `1` in the next iteration, and so on.
- We need to check if `i` reaches `works-1` before the loop can terminate.
- `works` will be `2` in the next iteration since it must be at least 2.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `0` (or whatever it was in the previous iteration).
- `cando` remains `True`.
- `t[works]` remains the same.
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` remains `-1`.
- `res` will contain one more character from `t` at each step.
- `works` will be `2`.

Final Answer:
State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-1`, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`, `works` is `2`**
