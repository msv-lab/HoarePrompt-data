Output State: **`i` is 26, `scount[26]` is 0, `t` is a list containing all characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each positive `scount[i]` where the loop executed for `i` from 0 to 25.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 25 (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, the `while` loop runs as long as `scount[i]` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the `while` loop, the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` is appended to the list `t` `scount[i]` times.
   - After appending, `scount[i]` is decremented by 1.

2. **Final State Analysis**:
   - By the end of the loop, `i` will have reached 26 because the loop exits when `i` is 26.
   - `scount[26]` will be 0 because the loop does not increment `i` beyond 25 and stops.
   - The list `t` will contain all characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each `i` where `scount[i]` was initially greater than 0. This means `t` will contain the characters `'a'` to `'z'` repeated according to their respective counts in `scount`.

3. **Non-Execution Case**:
   - If `scount[i]` is always 0 for all `i` from 0 to 25, the loop will not execute at all.
   - In this case, `i` will still be 26, `scount[26]` will be 0, and `t` will be an empty list.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished is as described above.
