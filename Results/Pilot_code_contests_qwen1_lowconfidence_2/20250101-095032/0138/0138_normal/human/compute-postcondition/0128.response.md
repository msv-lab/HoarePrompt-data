Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( t[i + 2] \) is a lowercase letter.
- \( scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')] \) remains 0.
- \( ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1 \) is less than or equal to 25.
- \( cando \) is True.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The loop starts with \( j \) set to \( ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1 \).
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as \( j \) is less than 26.
3. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - \( j \) is incremented by 1 at each iteration of the loop.
   - No other variables (\( t[i+2] \), \( scountcopy[ord(t[i+2]) - ord('a')] \), \( ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1 \), or \( cando \)) are modified within the loop.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- Since the loop increments \( j \) by 1, the new value of \( j \) will be \( ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2 \).
- All other conditions remain unchanged.

### Final State:

- \( t[i + 2] \) is still a lowercase letter.
- \( scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')] \) is still 0.
- \( ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1 \) is still less than or equal to 25 (since it doesn't change within the loop).
- \( cando \) is still True (since it doesn't change within the loop).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` remains 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `cando` is True.**
