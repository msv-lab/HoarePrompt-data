The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the `break` statement will simply exit the most internal loop or conditional structure it was inside. However, based on the initial state and the provided code snippet, it seems like the `break` statement does not affect the variables directly but rather breaks out of the implied loop or conditional block.

Given the initial state and the nature of the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `scountcopy[j] > 0` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25, `cando` is `False` otherwise, `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `works` is equal to `i + 1`. If `cando` is `True`, `works` is updated to `i` and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0. If `cando` is `False`, the state remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
