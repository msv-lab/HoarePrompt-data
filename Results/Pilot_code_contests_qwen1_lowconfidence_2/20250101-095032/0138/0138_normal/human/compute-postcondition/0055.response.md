`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` corresponds to the index of the additional element in the list `t`, which is a lowercase letter. Since `t` has one additional element, which is `chr(i + ord('a'))`, the value of `i` is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive). The value of `scount[i]` was initially greater than 0, so after decrementing it by 1, it will still be a positive number, but reduced by 1.

Output State: **`scount[i]` is a positive value less than the original value, `scount[26]` is a value greater than 0; `t` is a list with one additional element, which is a lowercase letter represented as `chr(i + ord('a'))`.**
