The code snippet `t = list(raw_input())` will take an input from the user and convert it into a list of characters. In the initial state, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, and `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

After executing the code, `t` will now be a list of characters from the input string provided by the user, while `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, `t` is a list of characters from the input string**
