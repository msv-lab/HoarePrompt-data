Postcondition: ***`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` remains 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `cando` is True. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if condition where `scountcopy[j] > 0` is checked and does not change any of the mentioned variables' states.***
