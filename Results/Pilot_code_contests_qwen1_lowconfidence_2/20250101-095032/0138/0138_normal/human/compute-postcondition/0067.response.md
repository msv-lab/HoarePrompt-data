Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- **Initial State After Previous Iteration:**
  - `i` is `prev_i + 1`
  - `scount[prev_i + 1]` is `scount[prev_i + 1] - 1`
  - `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0
  - `t` contains all the characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each positive `scount[i]` where the loop executed plus the new character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`

- **Loop Condition:** `while scount[i] > 0:`

### Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `scount[i] > 0`.

2. **Current State of `scount[i]`:**
   - From the given state, we know that `scount[prev_i + 1]` has already been decremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[i]` (which is `scount[prev_i + 1]` here) must be greater than 0 after the decrement.

3. **Initial State Constraints:**
   - `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0, which means there are no more 'z' characters left to consider (since `scount[26]` represents the count of 'z').
   - The current `i` is `prev_i + 1`.

4. **Character String `t`:**
   - `t` contains characters corresponding to positive values in `scount` and includes the character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`.
   - This means the character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))` was added to `t` in the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[prev_i + 1]` must be greater than 0 after the decrement. Since `scount[prev_i + 1]` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it must have been greater than 1 before the decrement.

### Adjusted State
- `scount[prev_i + 1]` must be greater than 1 to ensure it is still greater than 0 after the decrement.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `prev_i + 1`, `scount[prev_i + 1]` must be greater than 1, `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0, `t` contains all the characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each positive `scount[i]` where the loop executed plus the new character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`**
