In the provided code snippet, `res.append(t[i])` is executed within the loop. Let's analyze the impact of this line of code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `len(s) > 0`: The string `s` is non-empty.
   - `cando` is `True`.
   - `t[works]` is the last character checked.
   - `scountcopy[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `0`.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `works` must be at least `1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `res.append(t[i])` appends the character `t[i]` to the list `res` during each iteration of the loop.
   - Since `i` ranges from `0` to `works-1`, `t[i]` is appended to `res` `works` times.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `res` will contain the characters `t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]` after the loop completes.
   - All other variables remain unchanged: `len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scountcopy[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `0`, and `works` remains `works`.

4. **Final State**:
   - `res` is updated to include the characters `t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]`.
   - All other variables retain their initial states.

**Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scountcopy[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `0`, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`, `works` must be at least 1**
