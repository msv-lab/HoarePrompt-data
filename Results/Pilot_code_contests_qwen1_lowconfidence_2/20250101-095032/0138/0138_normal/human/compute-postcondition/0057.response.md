`t` is a list with one additional element, which is a lowercase letter represented as `chr(i + ord('a'))`. This means that the element added to `t` is `chr(i + ord('a'))`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

After executing the line of code, `t` will have one more element than before, and the new element will be `chr(i + ord('a'))`.

Output State: **`scount[i]` must be greater than or equal to 1, `scount[26]` is a value greater than 0, and `t` is a list with one additional element, which is a lowercase letter represented as `chr(i + ord('a'))`**
