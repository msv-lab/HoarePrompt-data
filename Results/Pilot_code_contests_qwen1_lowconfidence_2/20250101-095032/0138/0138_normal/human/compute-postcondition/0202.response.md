`scount[i]` is decremented by 1, reducing its value by 1 from its initial state where it was greater than 1. The value of `res` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect it.

Output State: **`scount[i]` is now `scount[i] - 1`; `res` contains the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` three times**
