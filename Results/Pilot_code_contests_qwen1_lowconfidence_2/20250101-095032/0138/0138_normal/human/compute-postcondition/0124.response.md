Postcondition: ***`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25. If `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `cando` is True. There is no change to the state of the program if there is no corresponding condition in the else part.***
