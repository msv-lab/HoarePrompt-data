Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes.

### Initial State:
- `len(s) > 0`: The length of string `s` is greater than 0.
- `cando` is `False`: The variable `cando` is initially set to `False`.
- `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter: The character `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter.
- `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0: The count of the character `t[i + 1]` in `scountcopy` is 0.
- `works` is equal to `i + 1`: The variable `works` is set to `i + 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    if scountcopy[j] > 0:
        cando = True
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop iterates over the range from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (since `range(start, end)` is exclusive of `end`).
- For each `j` in this range, the loop checks if `scountcopy[j] > 0`.
- If any `scountcopy[j] > 0` is found, `cando` is set to `True`.
- If `scountcopy[j]` is never greater than 0 for all `j` in the range, `cando` remains `False`.

### Final State:
- After the loop, `cando` will be `True` if any `scountcopy[j] > 0` was found, otherwise `False`.
- The other variables (`len(s)`, `t[i + 1]`, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]`, and `works`) do not change within the loop.

### Output State:
- The loop will check the `scountcopy` array starting from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` up to 25.
- If any element in `scountcopy` from this range is greater than 0, `cando` will be set to `True`.
- Otherwise, `cando` will remain `False`.

Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `scountcopy[j] > 0` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25, `cando` is `False` otherwise, `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `works` is equal to `i + 1`.**
