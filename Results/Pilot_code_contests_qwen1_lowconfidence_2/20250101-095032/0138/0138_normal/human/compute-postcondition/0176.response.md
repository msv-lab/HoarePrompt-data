The code snippet appends the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` to the list `res`. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it does not affect the variables that are explicitly mentioned. The only variable that changes is `res`.

Given the initial state:
- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `chr(i + ord('a'))`
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are either zero or decreased by one during the loop executions
- `works` remains the same
- `j` is the last value assigned within the loop
- `scount[i]` is `1`

After executing the line `res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))`, the list `res` will contain all its previous elements plus the new element `chr(i + ord('a'))`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `res` now contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `chr(i + ord('a'))` and `chr(i + ord('a'))`
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are either zero or decreased by one during the loop executions
- `works` remains the same
- `j` is the last value assigned within the loop
- `scount[i]` is `2` (since `scount[i]` was initially `1` and no decrement operation is mentioned)

Output State: **`cando` is True; `t[works]` is the last character checked; `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `chr(i + ord('a'))` and `chr(i + ord('a'))`; `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are either zero or decreased by one during the loop executions; `works` remains the same; `j` is the last value assigned within the loop; `scount[i]` is 2**
