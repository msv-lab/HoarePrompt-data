According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 26. At the end of the previous iteration, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is initialized to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and is less than 26. If `scount[j]` is greater than 0, the character corresponding to `j` is added to `res` and the loop or if statement is exited. This means that if `scount[j]` is not greater than 0, `j` will be incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 26 after it is incremented. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's determine the new value of `j`:

- Let's assume the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration was \( j_{\text{prev}} \).
- Since the loop continues as long as \( j < 26 \), we increment \( j \) by 1 to get the new value \( j_{\text{new}} = j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is initialized to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and is equal to \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \), and this new value is less than 26.**

In a more formal format:

State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is initialized to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and is equal to \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \), and \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 < 26 \)**
