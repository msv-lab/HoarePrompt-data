The code `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1` decrements the value of `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` by 1. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `len(s) > 0`
- `cando` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `scountcopy[j] > 0` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25, and `cando` is `False` otherwise.
- `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter.
- `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0.
- `works` is equal to `i + 1`.
- If `cando` is `True`, `works` is updated to `i` and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0. If `cando` is `False`, the state remains unchanged.

Since `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0 and `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')` gives us the index in `scountcopy` which is 0. Therefore, decrementing `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` will only affect the value at the same index if `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')` is also 0.

If `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` was previously greater than 0 (which would make `cando` True), decrementing it will now set it to 0. This means `cando` will become `False`.

Given this, the new state is:
- `len(s) > 0`
- `cando` is `False` (since `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is now 0)
- `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter.
- `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0.
- Since `cando` is now `False`, `works` remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `False`, `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `works` is `i + 1`.**
