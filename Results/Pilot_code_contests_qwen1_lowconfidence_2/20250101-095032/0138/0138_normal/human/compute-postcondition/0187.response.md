The code snippet appends a character to the list `res`. The character being appended is `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given the initial state, `i` is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred from the condition that `scount[3]` must be 1 or more and `scount[i]` is decreased by 1 where `i` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`.

Since `t[works]` is the last character checked, let's assume `t[works]` corresponds to the character 'd', which is the 4th letter in the alphabet (index 3). Thus, `i` would be 3.

So, `res` will append the character `chr(3 + ord('a'))`, which is 'd'.

Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus 'd' and now includes another 'd', `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, `works` remains the same, `j` is 1 more than `j_last`, `scount[3]` is 0, `scount[i]` is decreased by 1 where `i` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`**
