To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0
  - `cando` is True
  - If `scountcopy[j]` is not greater than 0, the state of the program remains unchanged.

- **For Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` starting from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` up to 25 (inclusive).

2. **Previous Iteration Details**:
   - `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0
   - `cando` is True

3. **Next Iteration Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range specified by the loop condition.
   - Since `j` starts from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` and goes up to 25, we need to ensure that `j` is still within this range.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through values of `j` until it reaches 25, the next value of `j` should be such that `j` is still within the valid range and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.
   - Given that `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, and assuming no changes to `scountcopy` or `cando` (since `cando` is True and does not change unless explicitly mentioned), the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

5. **Next Value of `j`**:
   - If `j` was previously `k` (where `k` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` or some subsequent value within the range), the next value of `j` should be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` should now be `k + 1`.

### Final Answer

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0
- `cando` is True
- `j` is `j + 1`

So, the final state is:
**`scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, and `j` is incremented by 1.**

State: **`scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, and `j` is incremented by 1**
