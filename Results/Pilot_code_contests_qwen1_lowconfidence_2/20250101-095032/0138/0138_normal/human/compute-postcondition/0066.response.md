`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is `prev_i + 1`, the specific value of `i` is `prev_i + 1`. Also, since `scount[prev_i + 1]` must be greater than 0, decrementing it by 1 means it is now `scount[prev_i + 1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `prev_i + 1`; `scount[prev_i + 1]` is `scount[prev_i + 1] - 1`; `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0; `t` contains all the characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each positive `scount[i]` where the loop executed plus the new character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`**
