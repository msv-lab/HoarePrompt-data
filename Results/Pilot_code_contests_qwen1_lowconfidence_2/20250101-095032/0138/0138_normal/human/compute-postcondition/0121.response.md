To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `cando` is `False`
- `t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter
- `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is `0`
- `works` is `i + 2`

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for values of `j` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `25` (inclusive).

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts when `j` is set to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `25`.

2. **Initialization and Range Check:**
   - The initial value of `j` is dependent on `t[i]`, specifically `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, this value must be valid and within the specified range (1 to 25).

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop will continue until `j` exceeds `25`.
   - Since `j` is initialized to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`, we need to ensure that this value is at most `25`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `cando`, `t[i + 2]`, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]`, and `works` are not directly involved in the loop condition but might affect the loop's behavior inside the loop body.

### Adjusted States:
- To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that the initial value of `j` is within the valid range.
- We also need to ensure that `t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter and `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is `0` because these conditions might be checked inside the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `t[i + 2]` must be a lowercase letter.
- `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` must be `0`.
- `j = ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` must be a valid value such that it is less than or equal to `25`.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
**`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25.**

Final answer:
State: **`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25**
