Let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop can execute:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `len(s) > 0`: This ensures that the string `s` is non-empty.
   - `cando` is `False`: This indicates some initial condition that might need to be adjusted.
   - `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter: This ensures that the character at index `i + 1` in the string `t` is a lowercase letter.
   - `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0: This ensures that the count of the character `t[i + 1]` in the array `scountcopy` is zero.
   - `works` is equal to `i + 1`: This sets the initial value of the variable `works`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `25` (inclusive).
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is within this range.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will only run if `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to `25`.
- Since `t[i + 1]` is already a lowercase letter and its count in `scountcopy` is zero, the loop should be able to iterate over the specified range without issues related to these conditions.

The main conditions to check for the loop to execute are:
- `cando` should be set to `True` to allow the loop to proceed.
- The range defined by `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `25` should be valid.

Given the conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is equal to `i + 1`**
