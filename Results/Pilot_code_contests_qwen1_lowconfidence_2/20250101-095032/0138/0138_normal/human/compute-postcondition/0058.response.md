`scount[i]` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `scount[i] - 1`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`scount[i]` is `scount[i] - 1`, `scount[26]` is a value greater than 0, and `t` is a list with one additional element, which is a lowercase letter represented as `chr(i + ord('a'))`**
