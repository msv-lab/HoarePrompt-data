`tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` is incremented by 1. Given that `char` is the third character in `t`, `ord(char) - ord('a')` calculates the index in the `tcount` list which corresponds to the position of `char` in the alphabet. Since `char` is the third character in `t`, and assuming `t` starts from 'a', the character `char` would be 'c', and its index in the alphabet is 2 (since 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, and 'c' is 2). Therefore, the value at `tcount[2]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 elements, where the index corresponding to `char` is now 4**
