`t` is updated by appending the character `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given the initial state, `i` is `prev_i + 1`, and the character to append is determined by the current value of `i`. Since `i` is `prev_i + 1`, the character appended to `t` is `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `scount[i]` must still be at least 2, `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0, and `t` now includes all the characters specified in the initial state plus the newly appended character.

Output State: **`i` is `prev_i + 1`, `scount[i]` must be at least 2, `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0, `t` contains all the characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each positive `scount[i]` where the loop executed plus the new character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`**
