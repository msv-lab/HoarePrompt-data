The code `t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends a character to the list `t`. Given that `i` is 0 and `ord('a')` is 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), the character appended to `t` will be 'a'. 

- The initial state is: `i` is 0, `scount[0]` must be greater than 0, `t` is a list containing ['a'].
- After the code execution, `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- `scount[0]` remains greater than 0.
- `t` will now contain two elements: `['a', 'a']`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `scount[0]` is greater than 0, `t` is a list containing ['a', 'a']**.
