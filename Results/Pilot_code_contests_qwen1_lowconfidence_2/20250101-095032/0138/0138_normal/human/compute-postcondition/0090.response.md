Postcondition: ***`len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, `t[i]` is a lowercase letter, and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 3]` is greater than 0. If `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, then the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.***
