Output State: **`t` is a list of characters, `char` is the last character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 elements where the index corresponding to `char` is now the length of `t`, `allgreater` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `t` is a list of characters, `char` is the last character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 elements where the index corresponding to `char` is now the length of `t`, and `allgreater` is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if `scount[i]` is less than `tcount[i]`.
   - If `scount[i] < tcount[i]` is true, `allgreater` is set to `False`.
   - The loop does not modify `t`, `char`, or `tcount` within its body. It only modifies `allgreater`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `allgreater` will be `False` because the loop sets it to `False` if any `scount[i] < tcount[i]` is true.
   - `t`, `char`, and `tcount` retain their original values from the initial state because the loop does not modify them.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the initial conditions), `allgreater` remains `True`. However, since the problem statement specifies the loop's behavior, we consider the loop always executing at least once.

Thus, after the loop completes, the final state of the variables is as described in the Output State.
