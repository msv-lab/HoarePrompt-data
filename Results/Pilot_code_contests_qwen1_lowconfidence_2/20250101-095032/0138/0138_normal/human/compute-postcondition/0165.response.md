Let's break down the given state and the for loop step by step to determine the necessary adjustments.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cando` is True
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \)
- `j` is less than 26
- `res` includes the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`
- `scount[j]` is decremented by 1

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The loop starts with `j` set to \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \).
   - The loop iterates over values of `j` from \( \text{ord}(t[\text{works}]) - \text{ord}('a') + 1 \) to 25 (inclusive).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \).
   - Since `j` is less than 26, the loop will continue as long as `j` remains within this range.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be \( j_{\text{prev}} + 2 \).

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `cando` remains unchanged unless there's a condition in the loop body that modifies it.
   - `t[works]` remains the same as it is part of the range calculation.
   - `res` will include the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` for the new value of `j`.
   - `scount[j]` will be decremented by 1 for the new value of `j`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `cando` is still True
- `t[works]` remains the same
- `j` becomes \( j_{\text{prev}} + 2 \)
- `res` includes the character `chr((j_{\text{prev}} + 2) + ord('a'))`
- `scount[j_{\text{prev}} + 2]` is decremented by 1

### Final Answer:
State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 2 \), `res` includes the character `chr((j_{\text{prev}} + 2) + ord('a'))`, and `scount[j_{\text{prev}} + 2]` is decremented by 1.**
