The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. However, no changes are made to the values of the variables within this context. The states of the variables remain the same as before the execution of the `break` statement.

Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is initialized to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and is less than 26, `scount[j]` is greater than 0 - 1, `res` contains the character corresponding to `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
