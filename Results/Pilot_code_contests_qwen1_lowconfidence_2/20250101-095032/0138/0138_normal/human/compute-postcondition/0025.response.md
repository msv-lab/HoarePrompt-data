Postcondition: ***`t` is a list of characters, `char` is the last character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 elements where the index corresponding to `char` is now the length of `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `i` is 0, and `scount[0]` is either less than `tcount[0]` or does not exist. If `scount[i] < tcount[i]`, this condition holds true. There is no change in the state since there is no else part provided in the code.***
