Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains the string formed by repeating each character `scount[i]` times where `i` is the index of the character, `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, `works` remains the same, `j` is 26, `scount[0]` is 0, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is the total number of times `t[works]` was added to `res`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution:** The loop iterates over all possible characters from 'a' to 'z' (26 iterations).
2. For each character `i` (where `i` is the index corresponding to a lowercase letter):
   - The `while` loop inside the `for` loop runs as long as `scount[i] > 0`.
   - Each time the `while` loop condition is true, `chr(i + ord('a'))` is appended to `res` and `scount[i]` is decremented by 1.
3. After all iterations, `scount[i]` for all `i` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 will be 0 because the loop ensures that each count is exhausted.
4. `works` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
5. The loop exits when all counts are exhausted (`j` reaches 26).
6. The final state of `res` is the string formed by repeating each character `scount[i]` times, where `i` is the index of the character.

In the case where the loop does not execute, the values of the variables would remain as follows:
- `cando` is True.
- `t[works]` is the last character checked.
- `res` is an empty string (or no characters added if `scount[i]` were initially zero for all `i`).
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero.
- `works` remains the same.
- `j` is 26.
- `scount[0]` is 0.
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is 0 if `t[works]` was not added to `res`.

This output state covers both the scenario where the loop executes fully and the scenario where the loop does not execute at all.
