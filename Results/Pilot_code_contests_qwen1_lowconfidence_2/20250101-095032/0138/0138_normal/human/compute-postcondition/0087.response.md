Postcondition: ***`len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, `t[i]` is a lowercase letter, and `scountcopy[j + 1]` is greater than 0. If `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, the conditions remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
