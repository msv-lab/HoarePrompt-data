`cando` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, `t[i]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, `t[i]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0**
