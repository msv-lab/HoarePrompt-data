Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `s` is a non-empty list of characters.
   - `t` is a list of characters.
   - `scount` is a list of 25 zeros followed by a single `1`, indicating that the first character in `s` (denoted as `char`) has been counted.
   - `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros, indicating no characters from `t` have been counted yet.
   - `char` is the first character in `s`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `s`.
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be another character in `s` to process.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was set to the first character in `s`.
   - `scount` now has a `1` at the index corresponding to `char`, indicating this character has been processed.
   - `tcount` remains unchanged as it only tracks characters from `t`.

4. **Next Iteration Preparation:**
   - To prepare for the next iteration, `char` should be set to the next character in `s`.
   - Since `scount` now indicates the first character has been processed, the next character in `s` should be considered.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `scount` will remain unchanged since we are not processing any new characters from `s` yet.
   - `tcount` will remain unchanged as we are not considering characters from `t` in this iteration.
   - `char` should be updated to the second character in `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty list of characters, `t` is a list of characters, `scount` is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `tcount` is [0] * 26, `char` is the second character in `s`**
