Postcondition: ***`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is initialized to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and is less than 26. If `scount[j]` is greater than 0, the character corresponding to `j` is added to `res` and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`.***
