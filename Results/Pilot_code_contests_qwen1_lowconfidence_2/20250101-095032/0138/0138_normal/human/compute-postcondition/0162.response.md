`scount[j]` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \), and the value of `scount[j]` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables (`cando`, `t[works]`, `res`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cando` is True; `t[works]` is the last character checked; `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 1 \); `res` includes the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`; `scount[j]` is decremented by 1.
