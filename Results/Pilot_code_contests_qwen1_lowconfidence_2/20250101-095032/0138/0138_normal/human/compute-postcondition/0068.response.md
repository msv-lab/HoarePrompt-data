`t` is updated by appending the character `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Since `i` is equal to `prev_i + 1`, the character appended to `t` is `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`. The values of the other variables (`scount`, `prev_i`, `scount[26]`, and `t`) remain unchanged except for the addition of the new character in `t`.

Output State: **`i` is `prev_i + 1`, `scount[prev_i + 1]` must be greater than 1, `scount[26]` is less than or equal to 0, `t` contains all the characters `chr(i + ord('a'))` for each positive `scount[i]` where the loop executed plus the new character `chr((prev_i + 1) + ord('a'))`**
