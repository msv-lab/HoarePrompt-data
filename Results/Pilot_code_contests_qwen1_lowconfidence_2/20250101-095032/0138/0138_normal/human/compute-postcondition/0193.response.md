Let's break down the given state and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions and is equal to the string formed by repeating each character `scount[i]` times where `i` is the index of the character
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero
- `works` remains the same
- `j` is 1 more than `j_last`
- `scount[0]` is 0
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is the total number of times `t[works]` was added to `res`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `25` inclusive. This means the loop will execute 26 times in total.
2. **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` is defined as `j = j_last + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. This implies that `j` starts from `j_last + 1` in the next iteration.
3. **Variable `scount[j]`**: The value of `scount[j]` for `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 is zero, and `scount[0]` is zero. Since `j` increases by 1 in each iteration, we need to check if `j` has reached or exceeded `25`.

### Determining the Next State:
- **`cando`**: Remains `True` unless the loop body changes it (which isn't mentioned).
- **`t[works]`**: Remains the same.
- **`res`**: Remains unchanged as long as the loop doesn't add new characters.
- **`scount[j]`**: We need to ensure that `j` does not exceed `25`. If `j` reaches `26`, the loop will terminate because `range(26)` stops at `25`.
- **`j`**: Needs to be `j_last + 1` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the key adjustment needed is to ensure `j` does not exceed `25`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_last + 1`, and `j` should not exceed `25`.

### Final State:
- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions and is equal to the string formed by repeating each character `scount[i]` times where `i` is the index of the character
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, and `scount[0]` is 0
- `works` remains the same
- `j` is `j_last + 1`
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is the total number of times `t[works]` was added to `res`

**State:**
**`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions and is equal to the string formed by repeating each character `scount[i]` times where `i` is the index of the character, `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, `works` remains the same, `j` is `j_last + 1`, `scount[0]` is 0, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is the total number of times `t[works]` was added to `res`**
