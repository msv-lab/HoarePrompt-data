`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is not specified in the code snippet, we cannot determine the exact index. However, we know that before this operation, `scount[3]` was -1 and `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` was 1. The code does not specify which `i` to decrement, but it does not affect the given indices.

Therefore, the only specific change is that `scount[3]` becomes -2, and `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cando` is True; `t[works]` is the last character checked; `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus 'd', another 'd', and the character corresponding to `ord(t[works])`; `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero; `works` remains the same; `j` is 1 more than `j_last`; `scount[3]` is -2; `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is 1**
