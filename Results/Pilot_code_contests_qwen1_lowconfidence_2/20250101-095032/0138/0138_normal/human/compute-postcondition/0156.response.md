The code appends the character corresponding to the value of `j` (which is an index in the alphabet) to the list `res`. Given the initial state:

- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `j` is initialized to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and is less than 26
- `scount[j]` is greater than 0

The value of `j` corresponds to the position of `t[works]` in the alphabet, and `chr(j + ord('a'))` will give the character at that position.

Since `j` is already computed and is less than 26, and `scount[j]` is greater than 0, the character corresponding to `j` can be appended to `res`.

Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is initialized to `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and is less than 26, `scount[j]` is greater than 0, `res` contains the character corresponding to `j`**
