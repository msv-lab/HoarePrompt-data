Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-works`, `res` is a list containing the first `works` characters of `t`, `works` is the length of `s`**.

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = works - 1`. This means the loop will execute exactly `works` times because `i` goes from `0` to `works - 1`.

2. **Variables Changes**:
   - **`res`**: Each iteration appends `t[i]` to `res`. After `works` iterations, `res` will contain the first `works` characters of `t`.
   - **`scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]`**: For each character `t[i]`, the count in `scount` is decremented by 1. After `works` iterations, this will be `-works`.
   - **`works`**: The loop runs until `i` reaches `works - 1`, so `works` will be set to the length of `s` after the loop completes.

3. **Conditions**:
   - The loop continues as long as `len(s) > 0` and `cando` is `True`.
   - The condition `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` being `-works` indicates that each character in `t` up to `works` has been decremented in `scount` exactly `works` times.

4. **Case Where Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `works` is 0), then `res` remains an empty list, `scount[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` remains 0, and no changes occur to other variables.

Thus, the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
