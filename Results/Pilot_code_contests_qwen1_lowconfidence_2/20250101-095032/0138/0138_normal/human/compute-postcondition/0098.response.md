`scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1. Given that `cando` is True and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0, the condition for setting `works` to `i` would be met only if `cando` was previously False or the value of `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` was already less than 0. However, since `cando` is True, the value of `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` must have been 1 before this operation (since it is now 0). This means `works` is set to `i`.

Output State: **`len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, `t[i]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is equal to `i`**
