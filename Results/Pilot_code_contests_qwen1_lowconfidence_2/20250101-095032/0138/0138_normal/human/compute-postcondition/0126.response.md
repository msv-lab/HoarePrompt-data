The code sets `cando` to `True`. However, since this does not affect the value of `cando` which was already `True`, and none of the other variables (`t[i + 2]`, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]`, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`) are changed, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `cando` is True**
