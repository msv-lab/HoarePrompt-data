The variable `works` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `cando` is True, and `works` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `cando` is True, `works` is equal to `i`**
