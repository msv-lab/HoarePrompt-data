The code appends the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` to the list `res`. Given the initial state:

- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 2 \)
- `res` includes the character `chr((j_{\text{prev}} + 2) + ord('a'))`
- `scount[j_{\text{prev}} + 2]` is decremented by 1

After the code runs, `j` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `j` directly. However, `res` will now include the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` instead of `chr((j_{\text{prev}} + 2) + ord('a'))`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `cando` is `True`
- `t[works]` is the last character checked
- `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 2 \)
- `res` now includes the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`
- `scount[j_{\text{prev}} + 2]` is decremented by 1

Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `j` is \( j_{\text{prev}} + 2 \), `res` now includes the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `scount[j_{\text{prev}} + 2]` is decremented by 1**
