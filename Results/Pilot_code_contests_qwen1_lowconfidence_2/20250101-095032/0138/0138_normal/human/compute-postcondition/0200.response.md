Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while scount[i] > 0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `scount[i]` is `scount[i] - 1`.
  - `res` contains the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` twice.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `scount[i] > 0`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `scount[i]` has already been decremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[i]` must be greater than 0 after the decrement.

### Determining the Adjustment:
- Since `scount[i]` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `scount[i]` must have been greater than 1 before the decrement (i.e., `scount[i]` must have been at least 2).
- Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `scount[i]` is greater than 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`scount[i]` must be greater than 1; `res` contains the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` twice**
