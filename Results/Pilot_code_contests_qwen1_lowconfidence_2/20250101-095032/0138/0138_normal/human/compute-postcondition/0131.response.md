Output State: **`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `cando` is True.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables `t[i + 2]` and `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]`:** These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop because the loop does not modify them. The initial state specifies that `t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter and `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0. These conditions are maintained throughout the loop.

- **Variable `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`:** This expression represents the starting index of the loop. The loop starts from this index and iterates up to 25 (inclusive). Therefore, the condition `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25 for the loop to execute.

- **Variable `cando`:** The variable `cando` is set to `True` if `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0 for any `j` in the range from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25. Since the loop checks each value in this range and sets `cando` to `True` if any `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `cando` will be `True` if there is any such `j`.

Given that the loop condition is based on the existence of a positive value in `scountcopy[j]` within the specified range, and there is no else part to reset `cando` if the condition fails, `cando` will be `True` as long as there is any positive value in `scountcopy[j]` within the range. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is greater than 25), `cando` will remain `False`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is that `t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `cando` is `True`.
