The code increments the count of the character `char` in the `scount` list, which is determined by the character's ASCII value. Since `char` is the third character in the list `s`, and `s` is a non-empty list of characters, let's denote the third character in `s` as `c`. 

Initially, `scount[ord(c) - ord('a')]` is 0 because `scount` is initialized with all zeros and only the count of the third character (`c`) is incremented by 1.

After executing the line `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1`, the count of `c` (which is `char`) in `scount` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `scount[ord(c) - ord('a')]` will now be 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of characters, `t` is a list of characters, `scount` is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], with the count of the third character in `s` incremented by 1, `tcount` is [0] * 26, `char` is the third character in `s`**
