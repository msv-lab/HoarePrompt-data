Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `cando` is True (this doesn't affect the loop condition)
- `t[works]` is the last character checked (this doesn't affect the loop condition)
- `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `'d'` (this doesn't directly affect the loop condition)
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero (this doesn't directly affect the loop condition)
- `works` remains the same (this doesn't affect the loop condition)
- `j` is 1 more than `j_last` (this indicates we've incremented `j`)
- `scount[3]` is 1 (this could be relevant as it may affect the loop condition)
- `scount[i]` is decreased by 1 where `i` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` (this could be relevant as it may affect the loop condition)

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `scount[i] > 0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `j` is 1 more than `j_last`.
   - `scount[3]` is 1.
   - `scount[i]` is decreased by 1 where `i` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `scount[i] > 0`.
   - We need to find out what `i` is, which is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`.

3. **Determine `i`**:
   - `t[works]` is the last character checked.
   - `ord('a') = 97` (assuming ASCII values).

4. **Possible Values of `i`**:
   - If `t[works] = 'a'`, then `i = 1`.
   - If `t[works] = 'b'`, then `i = 2`.
   - If `t[works] = 'c'`, then `i = 3`.
   - And so on...

5. **Check `scount[i]`**:
   - Since `scount[3]` is 1, `i` could be 3.
   - We need to ensure that `scount[3]` remains greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure `scount[3] > 0` for the loop to continue, `scount[3]` must remain 1 or more. Given the current state, `scount[3]` is already 1, so no additional adjustment is needed in this specific case.

However, since the loop condition is `scount[i] > 0`, and we don't know the exact value of `i` (it could be any value from 1 to 25), we should consider the general case where `scount[i]` could decrease.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `scount[i]` remains greater than 0. Since `scount[3]` is already 1 and no other specific `scount[i]` is mentioned, we can conclude that the only necessary adjustment is to ensure `scount[3]` remains 1 or more.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `'d'`, `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, `works` remains the same, `j` is 1 more than `j_last`, `scount[3]` must be 1 or more, `scount[i]` is decreased by 1 where `i` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`**.
