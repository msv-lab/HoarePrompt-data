According to the given for loop statement, the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 25`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `i` starting from 0 and going up to 25.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` needs to start at 0 to enter the loop. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   
2. **Loop Condition:** The loop will continue as long as `i < 26`. After `i` reaches 26, the condition fails, and the loop stops. Hence, `i` should be less than 26 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state "Output State" and based on the above points, we can determine the required state before the loop starts.

State: **`i` is 0 and `i` must be less than 26**
