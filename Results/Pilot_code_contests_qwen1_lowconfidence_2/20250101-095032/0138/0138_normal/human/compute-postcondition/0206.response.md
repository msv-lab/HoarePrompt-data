The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates directly on predefined variables `s` and `t`. 

Based on the provided cases:
- Case_1: The function returns `-1`.
- Case_2: The function returns `'z'`.
- Case_3: The function returns `-1`.
- Case_4: The function returns a string `'res'` which is formed by repeating each character `scount[i]` times, where `i` is the index of the character, under the condition that `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is the total number of times `t[works]` was added to `res`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return either `-1`, `'z'`, or a specific string `res` based on the conditions described.

Functionality: **The function returns `-1` in some cases, `'z'` in certain cases, and a string `res` which is formed by repeating characters based on counts from `scount` and matching characters from `t` under specific conditions.**
