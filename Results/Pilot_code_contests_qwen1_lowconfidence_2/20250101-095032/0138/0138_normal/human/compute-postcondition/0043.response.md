`t` is appended with the character `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given that `i` is 0, the character appended to `t` is `chr(0 + ord('a'))`, which is `'a'`. The value of `i` remains unchanged because the code only appends a value to `t` without modifying `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `i` must be less than 26, `scount[0]` must be greater than 0, and `t` contains the character `'a'`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `i` must be less than 26, `scount[0]` must be greater than 0, `t` is ['a']**
