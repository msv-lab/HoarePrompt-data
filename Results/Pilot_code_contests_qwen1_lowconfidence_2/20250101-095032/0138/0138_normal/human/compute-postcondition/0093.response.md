The variable `works` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of the other variables (`len(s)`, `cando`, and `t[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, and `t[i]` is a lowercase letter; `works` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, and `t[i]` is a lowercase letter; `works` is equal to `i`**
