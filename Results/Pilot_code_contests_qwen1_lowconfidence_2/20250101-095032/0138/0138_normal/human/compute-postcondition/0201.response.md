`res` appends the character `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Since `res` originally contains the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` twice, after appending it again, `res` will contain the character three times. The value of `scount[i]` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. 

Output State: **`scount[i]` must be greater than 1; `res` contains the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` three times**
