The code `tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1` updates the count of the character `char` in the `tcount` list. Given the initial state:
- `t` is a list of characters that must have at least one character.
- `char` is the first character in `t`.
- `tcount` is a list initialized to store counts of each lowercase English letter (26 elements, initially 0).

The impact of the code is to increment the count of the character `char` in the `tcount` list by 1. The `tcount` list is indexed using the ASCII value of `char` relative to `'a'`. 

Since `char` is the first character in `t`, and `tcount` is initialized to 0 for all indices, the value of `tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` will become 1 after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is a list of characters that must have at least one character; `char` is the first character in `t`; `tcount` is a list of 26 elements, where the index corresponding to `char` is now 1.**
