`cando` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `cando` is explicitly set to `True`, so it does not change from its initial state. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is equal to `i + 1`, there exists at least one index `j` such that `scountcopy[j] > 0`**
