`t` is a list, and `i` is an integer representing an index or value. The code appends a character to the list `t`. Specifically, it appends the character obtained by adding the ASCII value of 'a' to the value of `i`. This means that `t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends the character at position `i` in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.).

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we will denote it as `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a list with an additional element `chr(i + ord('a'))`, `i` is unchanged**
