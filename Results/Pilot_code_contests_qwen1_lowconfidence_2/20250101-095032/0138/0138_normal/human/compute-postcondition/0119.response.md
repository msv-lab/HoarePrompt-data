Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `len(s) > 0`: The length of the string `s` is greater than 0.
   - `cando` is `False`: The variable `cando` is currently `False`.
   - `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter: The character `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter.
   - `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0: The count of the character `t[i + 1]` in the `scountcopy` array is 0.
   - `works` is `i + 1`: The value of `works` is `i + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition for the for loop is `for i in range(len(s))`.

3. **Incrementing `i`**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`.
   - Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to determine the new value of `i` and check if it satisfies the loop condition.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `i + 1 < len(s)` for the loop to execute again.
   - All other conditions (`cando`, `t[i + 1]` being a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` being 0, and `works` being `i + 1`) remain the same for the next iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `len(s) > 0` remains the same.
   - `cando` remains `False`.
   - `t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter (since `i` is now `i + 1`, `t[i + 2]` becomes the character at position `i + 2`).
   - `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0 (the count of the character `t[i + 2]` in the `scountcopy` array is 0).
   - `works` is `i + 2` (since `i` is incremented by 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `False`, `t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `works` is `i + 2`**.
