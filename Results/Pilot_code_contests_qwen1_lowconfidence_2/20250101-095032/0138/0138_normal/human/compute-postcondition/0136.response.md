The code `break` is executed, which will exit the loop or control structure it is within. However, since no loop or conditional structure is explicitly shown in the code snippet, the impact of the `break` statement here is to indicate that the execution exits the current loop or conditional block. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `cando` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
