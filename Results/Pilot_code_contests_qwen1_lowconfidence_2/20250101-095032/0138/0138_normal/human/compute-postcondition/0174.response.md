`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. According to the precondition, `scount[i]` must be greater than 0, so after decrementing by 1, `scount[i]` will be exactly 1 (since it was originally some positive value and is now reduced by 1). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cando` is True; `t[works]` is the last character checked; `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus `chr(i + ord('a'))`; `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are either zero or decreased by one during the loop executions; `works` remains the same; `j` is the last value assigned within the loop; `scount[i]` is 1**
