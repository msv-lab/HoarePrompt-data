The code snippet appends a character to the list `res`. The character appended is calculated as `chr(i + ord('a'))`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 more than `j_last`, and `j_last` was previously `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')`. Since `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is `i`, the character being appended to `res` is the character corresponding to `i`.

Given that `i` is 1 more than `j_last`, and `j_last` was `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')`, `i` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`.

Therefore, the character being appended is `chr(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + ord('a'))`, which simplifies to `chr(ord(t[works]))`.

After appending, the updated state is:
- `cando` remains `True`.
- `t[works]` remains unchanged.
- `res` now includes `d`, another `d`, and the character corresponding to `ord(t[works])`.
- `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero.
- `works` remains the same.
- `j` is 1 more than `j_last`.
- `scount[3]` is -1.
- `scount[i]` (which is now `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`) is now 1.

Output State: **`cando` is True; `t[works]` is the last character checked; `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions plus 'd', another 'd', and the character corresponding to `ord(t[works])`; `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero; `works` remains the same; `j` is 1 more than `j_last`; `scount[3]` is -1; `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is 1**
