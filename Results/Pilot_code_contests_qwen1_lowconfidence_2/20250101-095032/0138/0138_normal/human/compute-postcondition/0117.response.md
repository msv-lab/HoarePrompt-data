Postcondition: ***`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `scountcopy[j] > 0` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25, `cando` is `False` otherwise, `t[i + 1]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and `works` is equal to `i + 1`. If `cando` is `True`, `works` is updated to `i` and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0. If `cando` is `False`, the state remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
