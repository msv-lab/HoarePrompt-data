Postcondition: ***`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `cando` is True. If `cando` is True, then `works` is equal to `i`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above.***
