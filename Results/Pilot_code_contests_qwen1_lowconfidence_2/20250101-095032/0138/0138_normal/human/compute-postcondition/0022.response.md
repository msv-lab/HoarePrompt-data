Postcondition: **`t` is a list of characters, `char` is the last character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 elements where the index corresponding to `char` is now the length of `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `i` must be between 0 and 25 inclusive, and `scount[i]` is either less than `tcount[i]` or does not exist (since there is no else part).**
