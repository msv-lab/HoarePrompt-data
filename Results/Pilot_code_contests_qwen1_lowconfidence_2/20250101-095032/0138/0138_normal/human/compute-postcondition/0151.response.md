`res` appends `t[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `t[i]` is `t[2]`, which is the third element in the list `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `res` now includes the element `t[2]`.

Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-2`, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], t[2]]`, `works` is `2`, `i` is `2`**
