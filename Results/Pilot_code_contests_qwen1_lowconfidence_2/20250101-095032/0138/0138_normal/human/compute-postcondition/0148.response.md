The code `res.append(t[i])` appends the value of `t[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `works` is 2, `i` would be `works - 1`, which means `i` is 1. So, `res.append(t[1])` is executed.

Before the execution, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`, which means `res` initially contains the first two elements of `t`. After appending `t[1]` (which is already in `res`), the list `res` remains unchanged.

The output state is:
Output State: **`len(s) > 0`, `cando` is `True`, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a')]` is `-1`, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], ..., t[works-1]]`, `works` is `2`**
