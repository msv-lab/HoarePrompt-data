The code increments the count of the character `char` in the `tcount` list. The character `char` is at index 1 in the list `t`, so its ASCII value is used to find the corresponding index in `tcount`. Since `tcount[char]` was initially set to 1, the new value will be 2.

Output State: **`t` is a list of characters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 elements, where the index corresponding to `char` is now 2**
