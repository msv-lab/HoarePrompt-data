`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is unchanged, and `t` is a list with an additional element `chr(i + ord('a'))`. The exact content of `scount` is not specified in the initial state, so we only know that `scount[i]` was initially some value which is now decreased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a list with an additional element `chr(i + ord('a'))`, `i` is unchanged, `scount[i]` is decreased by 1**
