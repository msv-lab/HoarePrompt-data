Output State: **`cando` is True, `t[works]` is the last character checked, `res` contains all characters added during the loop executions and is equal to the string formed by repeating each character `scount[i]` times where `i` is the index of the character, `scount[j]` for all `j` from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 are zero, `works` remains the same, `j` is 1 more than `j_last`, `scount[0]` is 0, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1]` is the total number of times `t[works]` was added to `res`.**
