The `break` statement does not modify any variables; it only breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(s)` is greater than 0, `cando` is True, and `t[i]` is a lowercase letter; `works` is equal to `i`, and `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is equal to 0**
