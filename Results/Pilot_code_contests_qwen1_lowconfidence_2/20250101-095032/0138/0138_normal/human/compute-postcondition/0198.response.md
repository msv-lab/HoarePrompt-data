`res` appends the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` to itself. The value of `scount[i]` is greater than 1, and `res` contains the character `chr(i + ord('a'))`. After appending, `res` will contain the character twice.

Output State: **`scount[i]` is greater than 1; `res` contains the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` twice**
