The variable `cando` is assigned the value `True`, which means it is now `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t[i + 2]` is a lowercase letter, `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 2]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0; `cando` is True.**
