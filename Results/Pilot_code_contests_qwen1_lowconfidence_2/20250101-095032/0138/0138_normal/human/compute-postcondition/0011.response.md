According to the given code, the loop will iterate over each character in the list `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must contain at least one character. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **List `t`:** The loop will not execute if `t` is empty. Therefore, `t` must have at least one character.
2. **Character `char`:** Inside the loop, `char` will take the value of each character in `t` one by one.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `t` contains at least one character and `char` (which is the current character being processed) is the first character in `t`.

**State:**
- `s` is a non-empty list of characters (though this doesn't directly affect the loop's execution).
- `t` is a list of characters that must have at least one character.
- `char` is the first character in `t`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty list of characters, `t` is a list of characters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `t`**
