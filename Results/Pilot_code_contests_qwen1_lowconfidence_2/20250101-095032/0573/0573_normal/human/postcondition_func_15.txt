The function `func_16` accepts no parameters and does not perform any operations within its body. Instead, it calls another function `func_19` with the argument 'YES'. The overall state of the program after the function concludes is that `func_19` has been called with the string 'YES' as its parameter. No changes are made to the global variables `x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6`.
