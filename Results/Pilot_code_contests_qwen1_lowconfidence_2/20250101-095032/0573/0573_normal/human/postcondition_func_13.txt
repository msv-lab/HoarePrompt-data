The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3 and even or divisible by 3, or if `n` is composite (not prime) up to the square root of `n`. It returns `True` if `n` is greater than 3, odd, not divisible by 3, and no number of the form \(6k + 5\) or \(6k + 1\) divides `n` up to the square root of `n`. The function covers all edge cases including when `n` is 0, 1, 2, 3, and checks for primality for numbers greater than 3.
