The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`. Since the definition of `func_3()` is not provided, the content of the returned list is undefined. There are no direct manipulations of the input variables (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6) within `func_4`, and it solely relies on the output of `func_3()`. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_4` concludes is that it returns an unspecified list produced by `func_3()`.
