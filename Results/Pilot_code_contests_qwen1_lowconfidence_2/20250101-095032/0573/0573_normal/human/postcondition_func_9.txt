The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` (which is derived from the initial states of `x` and `y` variables but its specific value is not defined in the provided code) and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. There are no defined `x` and `y` variables in the function, so the parameter `n` must be provided externally. The function directly converts the given integer to its binary representation using the built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code snippet.
