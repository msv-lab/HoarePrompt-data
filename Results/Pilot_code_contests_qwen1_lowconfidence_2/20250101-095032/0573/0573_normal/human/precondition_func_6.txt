l is a list of tuples or lists, where each tuple or list contains exactly two integers representing the coordinates (x, y) of points on the white sheet and black sheets. However, based on the context provided in the problem description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the function `func_7` does not directly relate to the problem statement. The function `func_7` sorts a list of coordinates, but the parameters and their relationships described do not align with the problem's requirements.
