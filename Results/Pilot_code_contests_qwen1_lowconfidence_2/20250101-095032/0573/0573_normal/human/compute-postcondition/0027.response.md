Postcondition: **`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet; `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet; `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `x6` being the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `one` remains `False`, `two` remains `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `a1` is `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, `a2` is `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`. The sum of `a1` and `a2` is less than `area`**
