According to the code, the loop is iterating over `args`, which means that `args` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Let's break down the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **`at_start`**: The value of `at_start` being `True` is irrelevant to the loop execution since the loop itself does not depend on this variable. It could be `True` or `False` without affecting the loop's ability to run.

2. **`args`**: The loop will execute if `args` contains at least one element. Therefore, `args` must have at least one element.

3. **Coordinates of Sheets**: The coordinates of the sheets (`(x_1, y_1)`, `(x_2, y_2)`, `(x_3, y_3)`, `(x_4, y_4)`, `(x_5, y_5)`, `(x_6, y_6)`) are not relevant to the loop's execution as they are not used within the loop body.

4. **Separator and File**: Similarly, the separator (`sep`) and file (`file`) are not relevant to the loop's execution.

Given these points, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is simply ensuring that `args` contains at least one element.

State: **`at_start` is `True`, `args` must contain at least one element**
