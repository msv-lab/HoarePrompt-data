Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a list containing all the elements that were passed to the loop, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key 'end' and its value is `\n` if 'end' was in `kwargs`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `kwargs` now also does not contain the key 'flush' and its value is `False`, standard output includes a newline character. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the buffer of `sys.stdout` has been flushed.***
