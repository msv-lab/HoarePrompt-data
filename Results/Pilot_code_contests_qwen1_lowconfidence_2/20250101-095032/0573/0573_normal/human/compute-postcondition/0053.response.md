Functionality: **The function `func_18` accepts six parameters representing the coordinates of two black sheets and a white sheet. It first checks if the black sheets overlap with the white sheet. If either black sheet completely overlaps or does not intersect the white sheet, it calls `func_16` and exits. Otherwise, it adjusts the coordinates of the black sheets to ensure they do not extend beyond the boundaries of the white sheet. Then, it calculates the areas of the intersections between the black sheets and the white sheet, and based on these areas, it calls either `func_16` or `func_17`. Specifically, if the combined area of the intersections between the black sheets and the white sheet is less than the area of the white sheet, it calls `func_16`; otherwise, it calls `func_17`. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the coordinates of the black sheets are exactly the same as those of the white sheet, leading to full overlap without the need for adjustments. The function also does not handle the case where the coordinates are invalid (e.g., negative values or exceeding the maximum limit).**
