`file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` function removes the 'end' key from the `kwargs` dictionary if it exists, and returns its value (which is `\n` by default), and writes this value to `file`. However, since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, it will print `\n` to the standard output. The variables `at_start`, `args`, and `file` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `args` is a list containing all the elements that were passed to the loop, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key 'end' and its value is `\n` if 'end' was in `kwargs`, otherwise it remains unchanged. Standard output includes a newline character.**
