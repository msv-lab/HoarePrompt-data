The function `func_18` accepts six parameters: `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, `(x4, y4)`, `(x5, y5)`, and `(x6, y6)`. These parameters represent the coordinates of two black sheets and one white sheet, all of which are tuples of integers.

- `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, respectively.
- `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet, respectively.
- `(x5, y5)` and `(x6, y6)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the second black sheet, respectively.

The coordinates are constrained such that \(0 \leq x1 < x2 \leq 10^6\), \(0 \leq y1 < y2 \leq 10^6\), \(0 \leq x3 < x4 \leq 10^6\), \(0 \leq y3 < y4 \leq 10^6\), \(0 \leq x5 < x6 \leq 10^6\), and \(0 \leq y5 < y6 \leq 10^6\).

Based on these coordinates, the function determines the relationship between the white sheet and the two black sheets. However, since the specific output is not detailed in the prompt, we can only state the parameters and their types.

Functionality: **The function accepts six parameters: `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, `(x4, y4)`, `(x5, y5)`, and `(x6, y6)`, and returns a value based on the relationship between the coordinates of the white sheet and the two black sheets.**
