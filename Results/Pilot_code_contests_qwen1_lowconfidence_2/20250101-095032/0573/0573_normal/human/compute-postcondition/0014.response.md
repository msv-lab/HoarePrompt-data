According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will continue as long as `args` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` contains at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element. Since the loop removes elements from `args` one by one, we know that after the last iteration, there is at least one element left in `args`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `args` should still contain at least one element.

The state remains the same because no other changes are specified or needed based on the given information.

State: **`at_start` is `False`; `args` contains at least one element**
