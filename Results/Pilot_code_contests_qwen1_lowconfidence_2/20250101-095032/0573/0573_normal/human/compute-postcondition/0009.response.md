According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute as long as `args` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `at_start` is `False`
- `args` must always contain at least one element

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element. However, since we are moving to the next iteration, the first element of `args` will be consumed, meaning `args` will now contain at least zero elements (but we need to ensure it still contains at least one element for the next iteration).

To maintain the invariant that `args` must always contain at least one element, we need to ensure that `args` is not empty before the next iteration. Since the loop condition only cares about the presence of at least one element, we can safely assume that if the loop continues, `args` will still meet this requirement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `args` must contain at least one element and `at_start` remains `False` because the loop has already started.

State: **`at_start` is `False`; `args` must contain at least one element**
