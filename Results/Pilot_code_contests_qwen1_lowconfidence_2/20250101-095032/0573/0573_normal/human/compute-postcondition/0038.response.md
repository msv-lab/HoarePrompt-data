`func_17()` is called, but the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without knowing what `func_17()` does, we cannot determine how it affects the variables. However, since no variables are directly assigned or modified within this line of code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`x3` is `max(x3, x1)`, `y4` is the minimum of its current value and `y2`, `x4` is the minimum of its current value and `x2`, `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet, `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a2` is `|max(x5, a) - x2| * |y5 - y6|`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `two and one` is `False`, and `a2` is greater than or equal to `area`.**
