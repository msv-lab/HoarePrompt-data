`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. However, the code does not modify any variables directly; it only performs an operation that would alter the content of a file. The initial state of `at_start` being `False` and `args` containing at least one element remains unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`; `args` contains at least one element**
