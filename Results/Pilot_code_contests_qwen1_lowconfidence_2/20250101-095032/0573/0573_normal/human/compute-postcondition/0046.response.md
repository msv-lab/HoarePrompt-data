The function `func_17()` is called, but without knowing the exact implementation of `func_17()`, we cannot determine the changes it makes to the variables. However, based on the initial state and the provided code snippet, we know the following:

- The area of the intersection `a1` is already calculated and is greater than or equal to another area.
- The values of `(x3, y3)` and `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are returned by `func_3()`.
- The value of `x6` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `x2`.
- The value of `x5` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x1`.
- `y3` is updated to be the maximum of `y3` and `y1`.
- `one` remains `False`.
- `two` remains `True`.

Since `func_17()` could potentially modify other variables or perform operations not specified in the initial conditions, we cannot assume any further changes without additional information. Therefore, the only updates we can definitively state are those mentioned.

Output State: **`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet, `a1` is the area of the intersection between the two rectangles calculated as `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `x6` being the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `one` remains `False`, `two` remains `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `a1` is greater than or equal to `area`, `func_17()` has been called.**
