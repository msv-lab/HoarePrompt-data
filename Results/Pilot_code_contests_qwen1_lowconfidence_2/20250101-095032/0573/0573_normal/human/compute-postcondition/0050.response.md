Postcondition: ***`x3` is `max(x3, x1)`, `y4` is the minimum of its current value and `y2`, `x4` is the minimum of its current value and `x2`, `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet, `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `x6` being the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`. If `two and one` is `True`, then `a1` is the area of the intersection between the two rectangles calculated as `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, and `a2` is `|max(x5, a) - x2| * |y5 - y6|`. If `a1 + a2` is less than `area`, both `a1` and `a2` are computed as described. If `a1 + a2` is greater than or equal to `area`, both `a1` and `a2` are computed as described. If `two and one` is `False`, then `a2` is `|max(x5, a) - x2| * |y5 - y6|`. If `a2` is less than `area`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `y3` is set to be the maximum of `y3` and `y1`. If `two` is `True`, then `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `y5` is the maximum of its current value and `y1`, `x6` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, and `func_17()` has been called. Otherwise, `a1` is the area of the intersection between the two rectangles calculated as `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `x6` being the minimum of its original value and `x2`, and `func_17()` has been called.***
