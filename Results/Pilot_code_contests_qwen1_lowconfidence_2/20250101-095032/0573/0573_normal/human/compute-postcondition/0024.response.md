The function `func_19` accepts four pairs of parameters: `(x_1, y_1)`, `(x_2, y_2)`, `(x_3, y_3)`, and `(x_4, y_4)` which represent the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of two black sheets, and `(x_5, y_5)`, `(x_6, y_6)` which represent the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the white sheet. The coordinates are integers within the range 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, and 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6.

Based on the given information, the function does not provide explicit return values or conditions. However, based on typical problem-solving scenarios involving coordinate systems and intersections, the function likely checks for overlap between the sheets.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_19` is to accept the coordinates of two black sheets and one white sheet and determine some relationship or outcome based on their positions, though the specific output is not detailed here.

Functionality: **The function accepts the coordinates of two black sheets and one white sheet and determines a relationship or outcome based on their positions.**
