`func_17()` is called, but without knowing the implementation details of `func_17()`, we cannot determine exactly what changes it makes to the variables. However, based on the initial state and the fact that `func_17()` is executed, the following inferences can be made:

- `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` remain the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the white sheet, respectively.
- `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` remain the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the first black sheet, respectively.
- `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`. According to the problem, `x6` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, one remains `False`, two remains `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`.
- `a1` is calculated as `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`.
- `a2` is calculated as `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`.
- `a1 + a2` is greater than or equal to `area`.

Since `func_17()` could potentially affect `a1` and `a2`, but we don't know the exact changes, we will assume the worst-case scenario where `func_17()` might alter the values of `x3`, `y3`, `x5`, and `y5` to potentially increase `a1` and `a2`.

Output State: **(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet; (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet; (x5, y5, x6, y6) are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `x6` being the minimum of its original value and `x2`, one remains `False`, two remains `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`; `a1` is `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, `a2` is `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`, and `a1 + a2` is greater than or equal to `area`.**
