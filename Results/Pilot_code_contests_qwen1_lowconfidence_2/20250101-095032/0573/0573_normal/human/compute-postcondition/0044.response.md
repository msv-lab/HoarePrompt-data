`func_16()` is called, but the specific implementation of `func_16()` is not provided. Without knowing the exact operations performed within `func_16()`, we cannot determine the exact changes in the values of the variables. However, we know that the function could potentially modify the values of `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, `(x4, y4)`, `a1`, `(x5, y5, x6, y6)`, `one`, `two`, and possibly other variables.

Given the constraints and postconditions, we can infer the following:

- `a1` is the area of the intersection between the two rectangles.
- The current value of `a1` is less than the area.
- `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `x6` being the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `one` remains `False`, `two` remains `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `x6` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`.

Since `func_16()` could modify these variables, we need to consider the possible impacts:

- `x5` and `y5` could be updated to be the maximum of their current values and `x1` and `y1`, respectively.
- `x6` could be updated to be the minimum of its original value and `x2`.
- `a1` could be recalculated based on the new positions of the rectangles.
- `one` and `two` remain `False` and `True`, respectively.
- The values of `y3` and `x5` are updated.

However, without the exact implementation of `func_16()`, we cannot determine the exact values of `x5`, `y5`, and `a1`. We can only state the conditions and constraints that apply.

Output State: **`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet, `a1` is the area of the intersection between the two rectangles (with the current value less than the area), `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `y5` is the maximum of its current value and `y1`, `x6` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, and the function `func_16()` may have modified the coordinates and areas of the rectangles.**
