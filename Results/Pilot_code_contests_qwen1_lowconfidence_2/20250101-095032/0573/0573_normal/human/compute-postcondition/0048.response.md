Postcondition: ***`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet. If `two` is `True`, then `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `y5` is the maximum of its current value and `y1`, `x6` is the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, and `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, `a1` is the area of the intersection between the two rectangles calculated as `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`, `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `x6` being the minimum of its original value and `x2`, `one` remains `False`, `two` remains `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, and `func_17()` has been called.***
