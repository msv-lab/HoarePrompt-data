The code `func_16()` is called, but no changes to the variables are shown in the provided code snippet. The function `func_16()` does not appear to modify any of the listed variables (`x3`, `y4`, `x4`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6`, `a2`, `one`, `two`, `y3`, `x5`, `two and one`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x3` is `max(x3, x1)`, `y4` is the minimum of its current value and `y2`, `x4` is the minimum of its current value and `x2`, `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet, `(x5, y5, x6, y6)` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a2` is `|max(x5, a) - x2| * |y5 - y6|`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, `y3` is the maximum of `y3` and `y1`, `x5` is the maximum of its current value and `x1`, `two and one` is `False`. The area is greater than `a2`**
