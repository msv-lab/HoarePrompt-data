The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected, so the values of `(x_1, y_1)`, `(x_2, y_2)`, `(x_3, y_3)`, `(x_4, y_4)`, `(x_5, y_5)`, `(x_6, y_6)`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `True`, `(x_1, y_1)` are the coordinates of the bottom left corner of the white sheet, `(x_2, y_2)` are the coordinates of the top right corner of the white sheet, `(x_3, y_3)` are the coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first black sheet, `(x_4, y_4)` are the coordinates of the top right corner of the first black sheet, `(x_5, y_5)` are the coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second black sheet, `(x_6, y_6)` are the coordinates of the top right corner of the second black sheet, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`**.
