Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the black sheets completely cover the white sheet. Let's analyze the code:

```python
(x1, y1, x2, y2) = func_3()
(x3, y3, x4, y4) = func_3()
(x5, y5, x6, y6) = func_3()
```

These lines read the coordinates of the white sheet and two black sheets. The subsequent logic checks for overlapping:

```python
one = two = True
if x5 > x2 or y6 < y1 or x6 < x1 or (y5 > y2):
    one = False
if y3 > y2 or y4 < y1 or x3 > x2 or (x4 < x1):
    two = False
```

If either black sheet does not overlap with the white sheet, it sets the corresponding flag to `False`. However, the code does not correctly handle the case where both black sheets completely cover the white sheet. In such a case, the flags `one` and `two` will still be `True`, and the program will incorrectly call `func_16()`.

To fix this, the code needs to check if either black sheet completely covers the white sheet and set the appropriate flag to `False` in that case. Here is an updated version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
one = two = True
if x5 >= x1 and x6 <= x2 and y5 >= y1 and y6 <= y2:
    one = False
if x3 >= x1 and x4 <= x2 and y3 >= y1 and y4 <= y2:
    two = False
if not one and not two:
    func_16()
    exit()
```

With this update, the program correctly identifies if the white sheet is completely covered by both black sheets and returns the correct output.
