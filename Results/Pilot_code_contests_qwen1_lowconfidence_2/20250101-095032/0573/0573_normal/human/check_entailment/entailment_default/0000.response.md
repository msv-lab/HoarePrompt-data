Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_18` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from above after the two black sheets are placed. Specifically, the function `func_18` does not properly check for partial overlap between the black sheets and the white sheet. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Area Calculation**: The function calculates the area of intersection between the black sheets and the white sheet but does not correctly account for partial overlap scenarios. The function should check if the black sheets partially cover the white sheet and if any part of the white sheet is still visible.

2. **Adjustment Logic**: The adjustment logic in `func_18` is flawed. It adjusts the coordinates of the black sheets to ensure they do not extend beyond the boundaries of the white sheet, but it does not correctly handle the case where the black sheets partially cover the white sheet.

3. **Overlap Check**: The function does not correctly check for overlap between the black sheets and the white sheet. It should use the coordinates to determine if the black sheets partially cover the white sheet and if any part of the white sheet is still visible.

To fix these issues, the function should:
- Properly check for partial overlap between the black sheets and the white sheet.
- Ensure the adjusted coordinates of the black sheets do not exceed the boundaries of the white sheet.
- Correctly calculate the area of the intersection and compare it with the area of the white sheet to determine if any part of the white sheet is still visible.

Since the provided implementation does not handle these cases correctly, the program is not fully correct.
