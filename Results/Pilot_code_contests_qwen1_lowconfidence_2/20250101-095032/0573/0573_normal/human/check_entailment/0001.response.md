Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly determine if the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets. Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - In the given program, the function `func_18` checks if the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets. It does this by checking if the bounding box of the white sheet is completely within the bounding boxes of the black sheets.
   - However, the program incorrectly assumes that if the bounding boxes overlap, then the white sheet is completely covered. This is not always true, especially when the black sheets cover only parts of the white sheet.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Overlapping Cases:**
   - The program checks if the bounding box of the white sheet is completely within the bounding boxes of the black sheets using conditions like `x5 > x2 or y6 < y1 or x6 < x1 or (y5 > y2)` and similar for the second black sheet.
   - If these conditions are not met, it proceeds to check if the areas of the black sheets are less than the area of the white sheet. This is an incomplete check and does not cover all scenarios where the white sheet might still be partially visible.

3. **Example Where the Program Fails:**
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     5 2 10 5
     6 3 8 4
     9 3 11 4
     ```
   - In this case, the white sheet has coordinates (5, 2) to (10, 5).
   - The first black sheet has coordinates (6, 3) to (8, 4).
   - The second black sheet has coordinates (9, 3) to (11, 4).
   - The program incorrectly determines that the white sheet is completely covered because the bounding boxes do not fully overlap, but there is still a part of the white sheet that is not covered by the black sheets.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly determine if the white sheet is partially visible when the black sheets do not completely cover it. Hence, the program is incorrect.
