Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the area overlap between the white sheet and the black sheets. Here's an analysis of a problematic case:

Consider the following input:
- White sheet: (0, 0), (10, 10)
- First black sheet: (1, 1), (9, 9)
- Second black sheet: (4, 4), (6, 6)

In this case, the white sheet is partially covered by both black sheets. However, the program incorrectly calculates the areas and determines that no part of the white sheet can be seen from above, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the way the program checks the areas and decides whether the white sheet is visible. It should correctly calculate the area of the white sheet that is not covered by either black sheet. The current implementation may not handle the intersection and subtraction of areas accurately.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown:
- The program calculates the intersection areas and subtracts them from the total area of the white sheet.
- However, the logic for determining if the white sheet is fully covered or partially covered is flawed.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly compute the area of the white sheet that is not covered by the black sheets, taking into account their overlaps. This involves more complex geometric calculations and careful handling of edge cases.
