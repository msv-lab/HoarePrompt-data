Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly determine if any part of the white sheet can be seen from above after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, the code does not properly account for the possibility that the white sheet can be seen even if the black sheets overlap partially but do not completely cover the white sheet.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Overlap Check:**
   - The function `func_18` checks if the black sheets overlap with the white sheet by adjusting the coordinates of the black sheets to fit within the bounds of the white sheet. However, this adjustment does not guarantee that the white sheet is still visible if the black sheets partially overlap the white sheet.
   - The logic to check if the black sheets overlap the white sheet is flawed. It should consider partial overlaps, but the current implementation only checks for complete coverage.

2. **Area Calculation Logic:**
   - The code calculates the areas of the intersections between the black sheets and the white sheet and compares these areas to the area of the white sheet. However, this comparison alone is insufficient to determine visibility. Even if the combined area of the intersections is less than the area of the white sheet, there might still be parts of the white sheet that are not covered by the black sheets.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2 2 4 4
3 3 5 5
5 5 7 7
```

- **White Sheet:** Bottom-left (2, 2), Top-right (4, 4)
- **First Black Sheet:** Bottom-left (3, 3), Top-right (5, 5)
- **Second Black Sheet:** Bottom-left (5, 5), Top-right (7, 7)

According to the problem description, the program should output "NO" because the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets. However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not properly account for the partial overlap.

To fix this, the program needs to check for partial overlaps and ensure that the entire white sheet is not covered. This requires a more detailed overlap detection mechanism, possibly involving more complex geometric checks.

### Conclusion:
The code fails to meet the problem description for the given input, as it does not correctly determine if any part of the white sheet can be seen when the black sheets are placed. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
