You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: There is a white sheet of paper lying on a rectangle table. The sheet is a rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the table. If you will take a look from above and assume that the bottom left corner of the table has coordinates (0, 0), and coordinate axes are left and bottom sides of the table, then the bottom left corner of the white sheet has coordinates (x_1, y_1), and the top right — (x_2, y_2).

After that two black sheets of paper are placed on the table. Sides of both black sheets are also parallel to the sides of the table. Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first black sheet are (x_3, y_3), and the top right — (x_4, y_4). Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second black sheet are (x_5, y_5), and the top right — (x_6, y_6). 

<image> Example of three rectangles.

Determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying not strictly inside the white sheet and strictly outside of both black sheets.

Input

The first line of the input contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the white sheet.

The second line of the input contains four integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 (0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the first black sheet.

The third line of the input contains four integers x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 (0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the second black sheet.

The sides of each sheet of paper are parallel (perpendicular) to the coordinate axes.

Output

If some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO".

500000 0 1000000 1000000


Output


YES

Note

In the first example the white sheet is fully covered by black sheets.

In the second example the part of the white sheet can be seen after two black sheets are placed. For example, the point (6.5, 4.5) lies not strictly inside the white sheet and lies strictly outside of both black sheets.
Program:
```
def func_19(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
