The function does not accept any parameters related to coordinates of sheets as mentioned in the annotation. Instead, it takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints these arguments separated by a specified separator (`sep`) and ends with a specified end character (`end`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the positional and keyword arguments have been printed to the specified output stream (`sys.stdout` by default), and the output buffer may or may not be flushed based on the `flush` argument.
