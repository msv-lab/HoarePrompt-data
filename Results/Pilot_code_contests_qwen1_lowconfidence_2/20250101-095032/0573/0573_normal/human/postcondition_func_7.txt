The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` and `m` represent the number of rows and columns of a 2D list, respectively, while `num` is the value used to initialize all elements in the generated 2D list. After executing the function, it returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is initialized to `num`. This function handles the case where either `n` or `m` is zero by returning an empty 2D list. No other edge cases are explicitly handled in the code, such as negative values for `n` or `m`, which would result in a runtime error since the function expects non-negative integers.
