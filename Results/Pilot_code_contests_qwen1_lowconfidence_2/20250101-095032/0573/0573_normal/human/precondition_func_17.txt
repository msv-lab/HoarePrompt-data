(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the white sheet, respectively; (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the first black sheet, respectively; (x5, y5) and (x6, y6) are the bottom left and top right coordinates of the second black sheet, respectively. All coordinates are integers such that 0 ≤ x1 < x2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y1 < y2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x3 < x4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y3 < y4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x5 < x6 ≤ 10^6, and 0 ≤ y5 < y6 ≤ 10^6.
