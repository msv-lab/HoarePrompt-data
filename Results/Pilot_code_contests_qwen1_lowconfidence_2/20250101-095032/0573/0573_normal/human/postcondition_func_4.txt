The function `func_5()` accepts the coordinates of a white sheet and two black sheets. It starts a new thread to execute the `main` function, which checks if any part of the two black sheets overlaps with the white sheet. If there is an overlap, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function sets a high recursion limit and stack size to ensure the thread can handle large inputs. However, the actual checking of the overlap between the sheets is performed by the `main` function within the thread.
