The function `func_13` accepts two integers `x` and `y` such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^6\) and at least one of them is greater than 0. It implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns `x`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` becomes 0 during the execution, indicating that `x` is the GCD, the function returns `x`. If both `x` and `y` are initially 0 or become 0 during the algorithm, the function returns 0.
