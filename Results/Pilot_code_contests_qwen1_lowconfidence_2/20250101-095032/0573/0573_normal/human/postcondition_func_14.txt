The function `func_15` opens two files, `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing. It does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. After executing the function, the standard input stream is redirected to `input.txt`, and the standard output stream is redirected to `output.txt`. This means any input read from the standard input stream will come from `input.txt`, and any output written to the standard output stream will be written to `output.txt`.
