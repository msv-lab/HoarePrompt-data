The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated string containing exactly 12 integers. These integers are then converted to integers using the `map` function and returned as a map object. If the input does not contain exactly 12 integers, the behavior is undefined since no error handling is implemented. The function does not modify any external variables; it solely relies on the input provided through standard input and returns a map object with the converted integers.
