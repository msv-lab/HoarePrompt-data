The function `func_17` accepts four tuples `(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2)` and two more tuples `(x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4)` and `(x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6)` representing the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of a white sheet and two black sheets, respectively. It calls another function `func_19` with the argument 'NO'. The function then checks if either of the black sheets overlaps with the white sheet. If there is an overlap, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, since the code only calls `func_19` with 'NO' and does not use any of the provided coordinates, the function does not actually check for any overlap and always returns `False`.
