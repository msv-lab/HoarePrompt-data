The function `func_2()` returns the input provided by the user. It does not accept any parameters and does not perform any operations on the provided inputs \(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6\) before returning the input. The function simply reads input from the user and returns it. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does exactly what the annotation states.
