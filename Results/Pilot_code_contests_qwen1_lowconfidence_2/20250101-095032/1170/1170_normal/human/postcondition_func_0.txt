The function reads a series of book pairs (ti, wi) where ti represents the type of the book and wi represents the weight of the book. It processes these inputs to determine the maximum total value of books that can be selected such that the total weight of selected books does not exceed their total value. It sorts the books in descending order based on their weight and iteratively selects books until the remaining total weight of unselected books is less than or equal to the total value of selected books. The function then prints the total value of the selected books. The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when the input list is empty or contains only one book. If the list is empty, the function will output 0. If the list contains only one book, the function will output the value of that book if the weight of the book is less than or equal to its value; otherwise, it will output 0.
