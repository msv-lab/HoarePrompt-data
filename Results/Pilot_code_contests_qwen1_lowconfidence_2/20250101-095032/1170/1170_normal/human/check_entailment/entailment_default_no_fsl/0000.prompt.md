You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Shaass has n books. He wants to make a bookshelf for all his books. He wants the bookshelf's dimensions to be as small as possible. The thickness of the i-th book is ti and its pages' width is equal to wi. The thickness of each book is either 1 or 2. All books have the same page heights.

<image>

Shaass puts the books on the bookshelf in the following way. First he selects some of the books and put them vertically. Then he puts the rest of the books horizontally above the vertical books. The sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. A sample arrangement of the books is depicted in the figure.

<image>

Help Shaass to find the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains two integers ti and wi denoting the thickness and width of the i-th book correspondingly, (1 ≤ ti ≤ 2, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100).

Output

On the only line of the output print the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    myBooks = []
    W = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        (t, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        W += w
        myBooks.append([w, t])
    myBooks.sort()
    myBooks.reverse()
    T = 0
    for book in myBooks:
        T += book[1]
        W -= book[0]
        if W <= T:
            break
    print(T)


```
Output hints: The function reads a series of book pairs (ti, wi) where ti represents the type of the book and wi represents the weight of the book. It processes these inputs to determine the maximum total value of books that can be selected such that the total weight of selected books does not exceed their total value. It sorts the books in descending order based on their weight and iteratively selects books until the remaining total weight of unselected books is less than or equal to the total value of selected books. The function then prints the total value of the selected books. The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when the input list is empty or contains only one book. If the list is empty, the function will output 0. If the list contains only one book, the function will output the value of that book if the weight of the book is less than or equal to its value; otherwise, it will output 0.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
