You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Shaass has n books. He wants to make a bookshelf for all his books. He wants the bookshelf's dimensions to be as small as possible. The thickness of the i-th book is ti and its pages' width is equal to wi. The thickness of each book is either 1 or 2. All books have the same page heights.

<image>

Shaass puts the books on the bookshelf in the following way. First he selects some of the books and put them vertically. Then he puts the rest of the books horizontally above the vertical books. The sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. A sample arrangement of the books is depicted in the figure.

<image>

Help Shaass to find the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains two integers ti and wi denoting the thickness and width of the i-th book correspondingly, (1 ≤ ti ≤ 2, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100).

Output

On the only line of the output print the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    myBooks = []
    W = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        (t, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        W += w
        myBooks.append([w, t])
    myBooks.sort()
    myBooks.reverse()
    T = 0
    for book in myBooks:
        T += book[1]
        W -= book[0]
        if W <= T:
            break
    print(T)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total thickness of the vertical books. The logic in the program does not properly account for the constraint that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. 

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```

This seems correct based on the example, but let's consider another case:

Input:
```
3
2 1
2 1
1 10
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

But the program outputs:
```
3
```

In both cases, the program incorrectly calculates the total thickness of the vertical books without ensuring that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. This is a critical flaw in the logic of the program, hence it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each book is represented by a pair of integers ti and wi, where 1 <= ti <= 2 and 1 <= wi <= 100, and these pairs are stored in a list or similar data structure.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    myBooks = []
    W = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        W += w
        
        myBooks.append([w, t])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists where each inner list contains the weight `w` and type `t` of a book, `W` is the sum of all weights `w` in `myBooks`.
    myBooks.sort()
    myBooks.reverse()
    T = 0
    for book in myBooks:
        T += book[1]
        
        W -= book[0]
        
        if W <= T:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with possibly some elements removed, `W` is the sum of the weights of the remaining books, and `T` is the sum of the values of the remaining books. If `W <= T` at any point during the loop, the loop will terminate early and these conditions will remain unchanged. Otherwise, after all iterations, `W` will be 0 and `T` will be the sum of the values of all the books in `myBooks`.
    print(T)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of book pairs (ti, wi) where ti represents the type of the book and wi represents the weight of the book. It processes these inputs to determine the maximum total value of books that can be selected such that the total weight of selected books does not exceed their total value. It sorts the books in descending order based on their weight and iteratively selects books until the remaining total weight of unselected books is less than or equal to the total value of selected books. The function then prints the total value of the selected books. The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when the input list is empty or contains only one book. If the list is empty, the function will output 0. If the list contains only one book, the function will output the value of that book if the weight of the book is less than or equal to its value; otherwise, it will output 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
