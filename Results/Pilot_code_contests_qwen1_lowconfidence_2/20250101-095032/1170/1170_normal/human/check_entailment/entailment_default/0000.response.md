Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum total thickness of the vertical books such that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books does not exceed the total thickness of the vertical books. However, the code attempts to maximize the total value of books under a weight constraint, which is a different problem.

The code sorts the books in descending order of their width and iteratively selects books until the remaining total width of unselected books is less than or equal to the total value of selected books. This approach does not ensure that the total thickness of the vertical books is minimized. For instance, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3
2 10
1 15
2 5
```

The correct output should be 3 (one book of thickness 2 and one book of thickness 1), but the provided code would incorrectly output 20 (the sum of the values of the books).

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
