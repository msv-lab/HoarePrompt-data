Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total thickness of the vertical books. The logic in the program does not properly account for the constraint that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. 

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```

This seems correct based on the example, but let's consider another case:

Input:
```
3
2 1
2 1
1 10
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

But the program outputs:
```
3
```

In both cases, the program incorrectly calculates the total thickness of the vertical books without ensuring that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. This is a critical flaw in the logic of the program, hence it is incorrect.
