Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where all books are horizontal. According to the problem description, Shaass can only place the remaining books horizontally if their total width is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. However, the program does not consider the scenario where placing all books horizontally might yield a smaller total thickness.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

According to the problem description, the optimal solution would be to place the second and third books vertically (total thickness = 2 + 2 = 4), and the first book horizontally (width = 10, which is greater than 4 - 10 > 0, so this is valid). However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum total thickness as 3, which is the thickness of the second and third books combined.

The program fails to check if placing all books horizontally results in a smaller total thickness, which is a critical requirement according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
