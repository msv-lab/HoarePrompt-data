The code `W -= book[0]` updates the value of `W` by subtracting `book[0]` from it. The value of `book[0]` is taken from the current element in the list `myBooks` being processed in some kind of loop. Since `myBooks` is in reverse order of its original sorted state, the current `book` is taken from this list.

The previous state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element.
- `W` is `W - book_i[0]`.
- `T` is `T + book_i[1] + book[1]`.

After executing `W -= book[0]`:
- The value of `W` is updated to `W - book[0]`.
- The value of `T` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- The value of `myBooks` remains unchanged as the code does not modify the list itself, only the elements being processed.
- The value of `book` changes to the next element in the list `myBooks`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer; `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element; `W` is `W - book_i[0] - book[0]`; `T` is `T + book_i[1] + book[1]`.**
