The code `t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `t` and `w`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0. The variable `myBooks` remains an empty list, and `W` is set to the value of `w`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `myBooks` is an empty list, `W` is `w`**
