The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the program will exit the current context.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one element.
- `W` is `W - book[0]`.
- `T` is `T + book[1]`.
- The condition `W <= T` holds true.

Since the `break` statement is executed, the loops or conditions that `W` and `T` are being updated within will be exited, but their values will remain unchanged because the update expressions (`W = W - book[0]` and `T = T + book[1]`) would not be executed due to the `break`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one element, `W` is `W - book[0]`, `T` is `T + book[1]`, and the condition `W <= T` holds true.**
