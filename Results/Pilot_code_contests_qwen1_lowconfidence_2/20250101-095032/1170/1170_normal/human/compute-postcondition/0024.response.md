Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one element, `W` is `W - book[0]`, and `T` is `T + book[1]`. If the condition `W <= T` holds true, then this condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, no additional information is provided regarding the values of `W` and `T` since there is no else part in the code.***
