`myBooks.sort()` sorts the list of lists `myBooks` in ascending order based on the weights `w` of the books. This operation changes the order of the elements in `myBooks` but does not affect the individual elements themselves or other variables. The sum of all weights `W` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a sorted list of lists where each inner list contains the weight `w` and type `t` of a book, `W` is the sum of all weights `w` in `myBooks`.**
