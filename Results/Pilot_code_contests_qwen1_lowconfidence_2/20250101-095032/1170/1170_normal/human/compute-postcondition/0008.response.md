The code `t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `W` respectively. Since the initial state of `n` is greater than 1 and `myBooks` is `[w, t]`, the value of `w` in `myBooks` is updated to the new value of `w` read from input. The value of `t` is also updated to the new value read from input.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t]`, where `new_value_of_w` and `new_value_of_t` are the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t]`**
