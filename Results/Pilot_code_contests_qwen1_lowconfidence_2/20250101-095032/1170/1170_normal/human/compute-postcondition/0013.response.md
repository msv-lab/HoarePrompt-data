`W` is incremented by `w`. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes `n` is greater than 1, `myBooks` remains unchanged, `t` is an integer from input, `w` is an integer from input, and `W` is increased by `w`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t, [w, t]]`; `t` is an integer from input; `w` is an integer from input; `W` is increased by `w`**
