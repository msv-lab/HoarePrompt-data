`W` is assigned the value 0, which was not previously defined in terms of another variable or expression. The initial state of `n` being an integer entered by the user within the range 1 <= n <= 100 and `myBooks` being an empty list remains unchanged. Therefore, the only variable affected is `W`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user within the range 1 <= n <= 100, `myBooks` is an empty list, and `W` is 0.**
