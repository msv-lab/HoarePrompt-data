Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element; `W` is `W - book_i[0] - book[0]`; `T` is `T + book_i[1] + book[1]`. If `W <= T`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
