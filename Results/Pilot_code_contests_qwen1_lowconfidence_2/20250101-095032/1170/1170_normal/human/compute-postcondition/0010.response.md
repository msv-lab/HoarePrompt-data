`myBooks` appends a list `[w, t]` to itself. The value of `n` is greater than 1, and `myBooks` originally contains `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t]`. After appending, `myBooks` will contain `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t, [w, t]]`. The value of `W` is not directly used in the code, so it remains incremented by `w`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t, [w, t]]`; `W` is incremented by `w`**
