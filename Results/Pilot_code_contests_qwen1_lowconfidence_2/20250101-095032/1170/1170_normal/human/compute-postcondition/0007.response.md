According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `myBooks` is a list containing `[w, t]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, and since `i` starts from 0, `i` should be 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

The state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (to allow another iteration).
- `myBooks` remains `[w, t]`.
- `W` is updated to its previous value plus `w`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `myBooks` is `[w, t]`, `W` is equal to its previous value plus `w`**
