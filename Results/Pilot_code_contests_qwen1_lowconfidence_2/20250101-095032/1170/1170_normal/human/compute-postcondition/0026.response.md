The code snippet updates the value of `T` by adding `book[1]` to it. The variable `book` is assumed to be the current element from the list `myBooks` being processed in some kind of loop. Since `myBooks` is in reverse order of its original sorted state, the current `book` is taken from this list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element.
- `W` is `W - book_i[0]`.
- `T` is `T + book_i[1]`.

After executing `T += book[1]`:
- The value of `T` is updated to `T + book[1]`.
- The value of `W` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- The value of `myBooks` remains unchanged as the code does not modify the list itself, only the elements being processed.
- The value of `book` changes to the next element in the list `myBooks`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer; `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element; `W` is `W - book_i[0]`; `T` is `T + book_i[1] + book[1]`.**
