To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. The loop iterates over each `book` in `myBooks`.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state and contains at least one element.
- `W` is updated as `W - book[0]`.
- `T` is updated as `T + book[1]`.
- If the condition `W <= T` holds true, this condition remains unchanged.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `myBooks` has at least one element in reverse order.
   - `W` and `T` are updated based on the current `book` being processed.
   - The loop continues as long as `W <= T`.

2. **At the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Assume the current `book` is `book_i` (where `book_i` is the last book processed).
   - `myBooks` now has fewer elements because `book_i` was processed.
   - `W` and `T` are updated based on `book_i`.
   - If `W <= T`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, no further information is given about `W` and `T`.

3. **For the Next Iteration**:
   - The next `book` in `myBooks` is `book_{i+1}`.
   - Since `myBooks` is in reverse order, the next `book` is the next item in the list (not the first, but the next from the end).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect:
- `myBooks` having one less element (since the last book was processed).
- `W` and `T` updated based on the previous book.
- The condition `W <= T` remains unchanged if it held true in the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, `W` is `W - book_i[0]`, and `T` is `T + book_i[1]`. If the condition `W <= T` holds true, then this condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, no additional information is provided regarding the values of `W` and `T` since there is no else part in the code.**

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, `W` is `W - book_i[0]`, and `T` is `T + book_i[1]`.**
