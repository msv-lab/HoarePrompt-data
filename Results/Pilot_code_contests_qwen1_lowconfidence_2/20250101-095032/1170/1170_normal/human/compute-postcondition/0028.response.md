The code `break` is executed, which means we break out of the loop or conditional statement we are currently inside. The variables `W`, `T`, `myBooks`, `n`, and `book` do not change their values as a result of the `break` statement. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the previous state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element; `W` is `W - book_i[0] - book[0]`; `T` is `T + book_i[1] + book[1]`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
