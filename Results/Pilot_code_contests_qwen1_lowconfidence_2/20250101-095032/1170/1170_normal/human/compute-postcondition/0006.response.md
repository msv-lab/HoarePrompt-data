`myBooks` appends a new list `[w, t]` to itself. The value of `n` is greater than 0, `myBooks` was initially an empty list, and `W` remains unchanged and is equal to its previous value plus `w`. Therefore, the updated state is that `myBooks` now contains the list `[w, t]`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `W` is equal to its previous value plus `w`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `myBooks` is `[w, t]`, `W` is equal to its previous value plus `w`**
