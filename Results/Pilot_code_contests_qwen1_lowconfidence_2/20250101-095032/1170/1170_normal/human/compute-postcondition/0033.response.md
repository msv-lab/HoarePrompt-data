The code `break` is executed inside a loop and causes the loop to terminate. Since the loop continues as long as `W > T`, the `break` statement means that the condition `W > T` is no longer true at this point. However, the values of `n`, `myBooks`, `W`, and `T` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify any variable. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, `W` is reduced by the first element of the current `book`, `T` remains unchanged, and the loop is terminated.**
