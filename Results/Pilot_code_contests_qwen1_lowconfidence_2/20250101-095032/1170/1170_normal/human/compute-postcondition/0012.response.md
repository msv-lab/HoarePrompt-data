The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `t` and `w` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 1, `myBooks` is a list containing specific values, and `W` is incremented by `w`. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `myBooks` remain unchanged, but `t` and `w` are updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t, [w, t]]`, `t` is an integer from input, `w` is an integer from input**
