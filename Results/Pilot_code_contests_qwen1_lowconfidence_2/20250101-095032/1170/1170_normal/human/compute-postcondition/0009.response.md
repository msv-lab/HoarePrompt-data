`W` is incremented by `w`. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, and the list `myBooks` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t]`; `W` is incremented by `w`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t]`; `W` is incremented by `w`.**
