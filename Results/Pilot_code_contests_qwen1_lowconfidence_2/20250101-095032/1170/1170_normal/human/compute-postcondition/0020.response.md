The code snippet `T += book[1]` increments the value of `T` by the second element (index 1) of the current `book` list. Since `myBooks` is a list of lists, `book` is assumed to reference one of the sublists in `myBooks`. However, the specific sublist referenced by `book` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `T` after the operation. We know that `T` was initially 0, and it is now incremented by the weight of the current book.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state that must have at least one element, `W` is the sum of all weights `w` in `myBooks`, `T` is `T + book[1]`**
