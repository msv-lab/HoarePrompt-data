Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, `W` is reduced by the first element of the current `book`, and `T` remains unchanged. The loop is terminated if `W` is less than or equal to `T`.***
