The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `T`. The values of `n`, `myBooks`, and `W` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state; `W` is the sum of all weights `w` in `myBooks`; `T` is 0.**
