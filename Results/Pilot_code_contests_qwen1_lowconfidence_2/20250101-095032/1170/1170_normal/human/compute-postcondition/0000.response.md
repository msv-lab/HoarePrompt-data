`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`. The raw_input function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns it. However, the actual value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, only its range. Since the code directly assigns the result of `int(raw_input())` to `n`, the value of `n` becomes the integer entered by the user, which is within the range 1 <= n <= 100. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user, within the range 1 <= n <= 100, and each book is represented by a pair of integers ti and wi, where 1 <= ti <= 2 and 1 <= wi <= 100, and these pairs are stored in a list or similar data structure.**
