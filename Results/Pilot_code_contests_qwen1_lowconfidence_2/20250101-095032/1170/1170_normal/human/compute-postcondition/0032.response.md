`W` is decreased by the first element of `book`. The first element of `book` is a non-negative integer because `book` is derived from `myBooks`, which contains non-negative integers. The states of other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, but the loop condition `W > T` is impacted since `W` is now reduced.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, `W` is reduced by the first element of the current `book`, `T` remains unchanged, and the loop continues as long as `W > T`.**
