The code `print(T)` simply prints the value of `T`. The value of `T` is the sum of the values of the remaining books in `myBooks` after the loop terminates. Since the code does not modify the values of any variables other than potentially printing `T`, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that `T` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with possibly some elements removed, `W` is the sum of the weights of the remaining books, `T` is the sum of the values of the remaining books, and the value of `T` is printed.**
