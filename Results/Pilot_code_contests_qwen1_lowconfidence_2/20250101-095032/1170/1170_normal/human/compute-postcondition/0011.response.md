According to the code, the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t, [w, t]]`
- `W` is incremented by `w`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must still be true. This means that `i` must be less than `n`, but since we are starting a new iteration, `i` will be set to `0` (the initial value of the loop variable). Therefore, `n` must still be greater than `1` for the loop to continue.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `myBooks` remains `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t, [w, t]]`
- `W` is incremented by `w`

Since `i` starts at `0` in each iteration, there is no need to change the value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1; `myBooks` is `[new_value_of_w, new_value_of_t, [w, t]]`; `W` is incremented by `w`**
