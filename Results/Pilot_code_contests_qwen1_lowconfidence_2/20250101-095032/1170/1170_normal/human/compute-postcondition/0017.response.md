The `myBooks.reverse()` function reverses the order of the elements in the `myBooks` list. Since `myBooks` is initially a sorted list of lists, after reversing, the list will be in reverse order. The values of `n` and `W` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state; `W` is the sum of all weights `w` in `myBooks`.**
