The code `W -= book[0]` subtracts the weight of the book (`book[0]`) from `W`. The value of `W` was initially the sum of all weights `w` in `myBooks`, and `T` was updated by adding `book[1]` to it. After this line of code, `W` will be updated to be `W - book[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state that must have at least one element, `W` is the sum of all weights `w` in `myBooks` minus `book[0]`, `T` is `T + book[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state that must have at least one element, `W` is `W - book[0]`, `T` is `T + book[1]`**
