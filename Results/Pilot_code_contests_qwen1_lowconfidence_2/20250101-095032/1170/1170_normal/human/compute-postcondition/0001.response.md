The code initializes an empty list named `myBooks`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the pairs representing the books. The precondition that `n` is an integer entered by the user within the range 1 <= n <= 100, and each book is represented by a pair of integers (ti, wi) where 1 <= ti <= 2 and 1 <= wi <= 100, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user within the range 1 <= n <= 100, `myBooks` is an empty list, and each book is represented by a pair of integers (ti, wi) where 1 <= ti <= 2 and 1 <= wi <= 100.**
