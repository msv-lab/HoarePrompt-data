According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an integer entered by the user within the range 1 <= n <= 100, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

- The initial state of `n` being within the range 1 <= n <= 100 ensures that `n` is a positive integer, but we specifically need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `myBooks` being an empty list and `W` being 0 do not affect the execution of the loop since they are not used in the loop condition or in determining if the loop should run.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `myBooks` is an empty list, `W` is 0**
