`T` is incremented by the second element of the current `book` from `myBooks`. The loop continues as long as `W > T`. The initial state is that `n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, and the loop continues as long as `W > T`. After the line `T += book[1]` is executed, `T` is updated to the sum of its previous value and the second element of the current `book`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, `W` and `T` are updated based on the current `book` from `myBooks` (specifically, `T` is increased by the second element of `book`), and the loop continues as long as `W > T`.**
