The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function involves processing a list of book pairs, where each pair consists of integers ti and wi, and ti is in the range [1, 2] while wi is in the range [1, 100]. Based on the given conditions, the function will return information about the books.

However, since no specific output cases are provided, the return value is not fully defined in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes a list of book pairs (ti, wi) where 1 <= ti <= 2 and 1 <= wi <= 100, and returns information based on these pairs.**
