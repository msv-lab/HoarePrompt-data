Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with possibly some elements removed, `W` is the sum of the weights of the remaining books, and `T` is the sum of the values of the remaining books. If `W <= T` at any point during the loop, the loop will terminate early and these conditions will remain unchanged. Otherwise, after all iterations, `W` will be 0 and `T` will be the sum of the values of all the books in `myBooks`.**
