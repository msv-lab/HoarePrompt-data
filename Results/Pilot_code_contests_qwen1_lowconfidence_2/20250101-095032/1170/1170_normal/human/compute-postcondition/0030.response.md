Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element.
   - `W` is `W - book_i[0] - book[0]`.
   - `T` is `T + book_i[1] + book[1]`.
   - The loop breaks if `W <= T`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `W > T`.

3. **What Happens in Each Iteration:**
   - `book` is assigned the current element of `myBooks`.
   - The loop body is executed (which we don't know the details of, but it presumably changes `W` and `T` based on `book`).

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop condition is `W > T`, the loop will continue if `W` remains greater than `T` after processing the current `book`.
   - After processing the current `book`, `myBooks` will be updated to the next element in the list.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - `myBooks` will be updated to the next element in the list, which means it now has one less element.
   - `W` and `T` will be updated according to the loop body, but since the loop body details are omitted, we assume `W` and `T` change based on the current `book`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `W > T`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element.
- `W` and `T` are updated based on the current `book` from `myBooks`.
- The loop will continue as long as `W > T`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `myBooks` is a list of lists in reverse order of its original sorted state with at least one less element, `W` and `T` are updated based on the current `book` from `myBooks`, and the loop continues as long as `W > T`.**
