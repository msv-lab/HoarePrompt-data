This function takes an iterable `args` and optional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It writes the string representations of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, it flushes the internal buffer of `file`. The function does not modify the input variables `r`, `g`, and `b` (which are not used in the function). After executing, the `file` contains the concatenated string of `args` elements, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer is flushed.
