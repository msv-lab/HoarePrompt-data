    g -= r
    b -= r
    t += g // 3

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters and processes an input string containing three non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons, separated by exactly one space. It sorts these values such that `r` is the smallest, `g` is the middle, and `b` is the largest. The function then calculates a new value `t` based on the initial values of `r`, `g`, and `b` through a series of arithmetic operations. Specifically, `t` is initially set to `r`, then adjusted by subtracting `r` from `g` and `b`, and further modified based on the remaining values of `g` and `b`.

After processing, `g` is reduced to its remainder when divided by 3, and `t` is incremented by a value derived from the conditions involving `g` and `b`. Finally, `t` is passed to `func_2`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input does not contain exactly three integers separated by a single space, the function behavior is undefined due to the lack of error handling.
- If `g` is 1 and `b` is greater than 1, or `g` is 2 and `b` is greater than 0, `t` is incremented accordingly.

The final state of the program after `func_1` concludes is that `t` holds the calculated value based on the input and the specified operations, and this value is passed to `func_2` for further processing.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an iterable `args` and optional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It writes the string representations of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, it flushes the internal buffer of `file`. The function does not modify the input variables `r`, `g`, and `b` (which are not used in the function). After executing, the `file` contains the concatenated string of `args` elements, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer is flushed.
