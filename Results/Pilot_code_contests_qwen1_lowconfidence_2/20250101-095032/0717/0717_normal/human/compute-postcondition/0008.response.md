The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable, and `file` now contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content (assuming `at_start` is `False`).
