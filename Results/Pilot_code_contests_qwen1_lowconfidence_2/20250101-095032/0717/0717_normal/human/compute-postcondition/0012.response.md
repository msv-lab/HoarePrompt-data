`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume `x` is an integer (as it typically is when using `write` with `str`). The method `write` does not return a value, so the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable. Additionally, the value of `file` now contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.**
