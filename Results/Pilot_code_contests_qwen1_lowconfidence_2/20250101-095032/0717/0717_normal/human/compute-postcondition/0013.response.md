The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect the values of `r`, `g`, `b`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable. Additionally, the value of `file` now contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.**
