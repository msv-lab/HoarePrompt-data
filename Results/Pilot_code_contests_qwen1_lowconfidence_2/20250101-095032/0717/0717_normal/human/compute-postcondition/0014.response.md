Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `r` is a non-negative integer
   - `g` is a non-negative integer
   - `b` is a non-negative integer
   - `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space
   - `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`
   - `at_start` is `False`
   - `args` must be a non-empty iterable
   - The value of `file` now contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine what changes occur during each iteration:**
   - `x` takes the next element from the `args` iterable.
   - `file` gets the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `args` is a non-empty iterable and we are in the middle of the loop, `args` must still be an iterable containing at least one element (since `at_start` is `False`, it means we are not at the start of the loop).
   - The next element `x` will be taken from `args`.
   - The `file` variable will have its content updated to include the string representation of the next `x`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration:**
   - `r` remains a non-negative integer
   - `g` remains a non-negative integer
   - `b` remains a non-negative integer
   - `sep` remains as either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space
   - `file` will now contain the string representation of the next `x` appended to its current content
   - `at_start` will remain `False` (since we are not at the start of the loop)
   - `args` will still be a non-empty iterable, but it will have one fewer element than before

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` appended to its current content, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable**.
