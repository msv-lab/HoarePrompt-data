The line `at_start = False` sets the variable `at_start` to `False`. This changes the value of `at_start` from its initial value of `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by the string representation of the current `x`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable.**
