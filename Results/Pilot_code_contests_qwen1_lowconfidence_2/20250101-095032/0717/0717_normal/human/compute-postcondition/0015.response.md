`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The value of `sep` is either `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep` appended to its current content, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable**
