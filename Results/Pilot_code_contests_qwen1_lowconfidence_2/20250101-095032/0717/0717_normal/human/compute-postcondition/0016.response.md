Postcondition: ***`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep` appended to its current content, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `not at_start` is met or not since the else part does not change these variables and the if part always updates the state when `not at_start` is true.***
