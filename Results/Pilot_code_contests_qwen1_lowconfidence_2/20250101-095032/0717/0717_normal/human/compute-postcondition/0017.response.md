The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since the initial state indicates that `file` currently contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep` appended to its current content, writing `str(x)` to the file will append the new string representation of `x` without an additional `sep`.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by the string representation of the current `x`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` is a non-empty iterable.**
