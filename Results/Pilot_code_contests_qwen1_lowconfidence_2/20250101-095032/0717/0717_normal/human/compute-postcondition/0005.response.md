The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Since `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, and `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, the operation will write the value of `sep` to `file`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable, `file` has written `sep` to itself**
