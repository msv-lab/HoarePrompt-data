Postcondition: ***`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable. If `not at_start` is `True`, `file` has written the value of `sep` to itself.***
