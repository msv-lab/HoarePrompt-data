`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `r`, `g`, `b`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**.
