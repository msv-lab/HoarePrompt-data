The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object referred to by `file`. Since `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, and `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, the write operation will append the value of `sep` to the file. The other variables (`r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, and `args`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer; `g` is a non-negative integer; `b` is a non-negative integer; `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space; `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must be a non-empty iterable; `file` has written the value of `sep` to itself.**
