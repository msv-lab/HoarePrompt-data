The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` does the following:

1. It pops the value associated with the key `'sep'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns it to the variable `sep`. If `'sep'` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to the string `' '` (a single space).
2. It pops the value associated with the key `'file'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns it to the variable `file`. If `'file'` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

Since `r`, `g`, and `b` are not affected by this code, their values remain unchanged. The variables `sep` and `file` are newly assigned based on the `kwargs` dictionary.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` or a single space, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`.**
