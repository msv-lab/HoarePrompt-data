You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have r red, g green and b blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number t of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?

Your task is to write a program that for given values r, g and b will find the maximum number t of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.

Input

The single line contains three integers r, g and b (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·109) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

Output

Print a single integer t — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.

Examples

Input

5 4 3


Output

4


Input

1 1 1


Output

1


Input

2 3 3


Output

2

Note

In the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (r, g, b) = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    t = r
    g -= r
    b -= r
    t += g // 3
    b -= g - g % 3
    g = g % 3
    t += (g == 1 and b > 1) + (g == 2 and b > 0)
    func_2(t)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
