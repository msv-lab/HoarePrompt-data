Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly calculate the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with three balloons of different colors. The logic in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Initial Calculation**: The initial value of `t` is set to `r`, which means all red balloons are assumed to be used first. However, this does not necessarily maximize the number of tables that can be decorated.

2. **Adjustments for Green and Blue Balloons**: The code attempts to use as many green and blue balloons as possible, but it does not correctly account for all possible combinations of red, green, and blue balloons to form tables.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not consider all possible scenarios, such as when the number of green or blue balloons is very small compared to the number of red balloons. For example, if `r = 10`, `g = 2`, and `b = 3`, the code would incorrectly calculate the number of tables.

To illustrate, let's consider the following example:

- Input: `5 4 3`
- Expected Output: `4`

The correct approach would be to ensure that the minimum of the three groups (red, green, and blue) is used to determine the maximum number of tables. In this case, the minimum value is `3`, so the maximum number of tables that can be decorated is `3`.

However, the provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
