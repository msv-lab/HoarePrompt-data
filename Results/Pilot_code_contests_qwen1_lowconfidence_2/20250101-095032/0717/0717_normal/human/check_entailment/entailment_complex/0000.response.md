Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the number of balloons of any color is less than 3. According to the problem description, to decorate a single table, you need exactly three balloons of different colors. However, the code only ensures that the number of red balloons is at most the minimum of the three colors, and it does not check if the other two colors have at least 3 balloons. 

For example, consider the input `2 2 1`. The code will sort the values and set `r = 1`, `g = 2`, and `b = 2`. It will then set `t = r = 1` and proceed to adjust `g` and `b`. However, since `b` is only 1, it is impossible to form even one table with three different colored balloons. Therefore, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated is 0, but the code will output `1` because it does not handle this edge case.

To fix this, you need to ensure that each color has at least 3 balloons before proceeding with the calculation. Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1():
    r, g, b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    if r < 3 or g < 3 or b < 3:
        print(0)
        return
    
    t = r
    g -= r
    b -= r
    t += g // 3
    b -= g - g % 3
    g = g % 3
    t += (g == 1 and b > 1) + (g == 2 and b > 0)
    func_2(t)
```

With this modification, the code will correctly handle cases where the number of balloons of any color is less than 3.
