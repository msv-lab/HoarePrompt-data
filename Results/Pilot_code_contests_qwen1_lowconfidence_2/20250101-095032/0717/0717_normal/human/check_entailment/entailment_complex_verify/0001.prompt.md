You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have r red, g green and b blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number t of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?

Your task is to write a program that for given values r, g and b will find the maximum number t of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.

Input

The single line contains three integers r, g and b (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·109) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

Output

Print a single integer t — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.

Examples

Input

5 4 3


Output

4


Input

1 1 1


Output

1


Input

2 3 3


Output

2

Note

In the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (r, g, b) = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    t = r
    g -= r
    b -= r
    t += g // 3
    b -= g - g % 3
    g = g % 3
    t += (g == 1 and b > 1) + (g == 2 and b > 0)
    func_2(t)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated. Specifically, the program subtracts the number of red balloons from both green and blue balloons before calculating the number of tables, which is not always correct.

For example, consider the input `5 4 3`. According to the problem description, we need to maximize the number of tables with exactly three different colored balloons. The correct approach would be to use the minimum of the three counts as the base count for the tables, and then adjust based on the remaining balloons.

However, the program incorrectly handles the distribution of the remaining balloons after using the minimum count. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Input:** `5 4 3`
2. **Sorted Balloons:** `3 4 5`
3. **Using the Minimum Count (`3`):**
   - Red: `5`
   - Green: `4 - 3 = 1`
   - Blue: `3 - 3 = 0`

The program then tries to distribute the remaining balloons, but it incorrectly reduces the green and blue counts without considering the constraints properly.

To illustrate, the program would calculate:
- `t = 3` (initial base count)
- `g -= 3` (Green becomes `1`)
- `b -= 3` (Blue becomes `0`)

This leads to an incorrect calculation because the remaining green and blue balloons cannot form additional tables correctly. A correct approach would be to ensure that the remaining balloons can still form valid sets of three different colors.

A more accurate approach would involve:
- Using the minimum count (`min(r, g, b)`) as the base count.
- Adjusting the remaining counts to ensure valid sets can be formed.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the output is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    func_2(t)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters and processes an input string containing three non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons, separated by exactly one space. It sorts these values such that `r` is the smallest, `g` is the middle, and `b` is the largest. The function then calculates a new value `t` based on the initial values of `r`, `g`, and `b` through a series of arithmetic operations. Specifically, `t` is initially set to `r`, then adjusted by subtracting `r` from `g` and `b`, and further modified based on the remaining values of `g` and `b`.

After processing, `g` is reduced to its remainder when divided by 3, and `t` is incremented by a value derived from the conditions involving `g` and `b`. Finally, `t` is passed to `func_2`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input does not contain exactly three integers separated by a single space, the function behavior is undefined due to the lack of error handling.
- If `g` is 1 and `b` is greater than 1, or `g` is 2 and `b` is greater than 0, `t` is incremented accordingly.

The final state of the program after `func_1` concludes is that `t` holds the calculated value based on the input and the specified operations, and this value is passed to `func_2` for further processing.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an iterable `args` and optional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It writes the string representations of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, it flushes the internal buffer of `file`. The function does not modify the input variables `r`, `g`, and `b` (which are not used in the function). After executing, the `file` contains the concatenated string of `args` elements, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer is flushed.
