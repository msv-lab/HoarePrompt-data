The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of districts), `k` (the number of contestants to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the connections between districts). It constructs a data structure using the `storage` and `lookup` lists to represent the connections between districts. Then, it builds a tree-like structure using the `nodes` list, where each node's left child is stored in `nodes[v * 2]` and the right child in `nodes[v * 2 + 1]`. After constructing the tree, it removes `k` districts (contestants) and updates the `nodes` list accordingly. Finally, it prints the remaining districts that are not removed.
