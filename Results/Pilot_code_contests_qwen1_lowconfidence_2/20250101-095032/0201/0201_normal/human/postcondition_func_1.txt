The function `func_2()` reads the number of districts \( n \) and the number of queries \( k \) from standard input, followed by a list of \( n-1 \) tuples representing the roads connecting the districts. It then calls another function `func_1(n, k, edges)` with these parameters. After `func_1` executes, the function does not return any value but sets up the environment for further processing of district connectivity queries. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values outside the specified range (e.g., \( n \) or \( k \) not being positive integers, or \( k \geq n \)). If `func_1` does not handle these edge cases, they should be noted as missing functionality.
