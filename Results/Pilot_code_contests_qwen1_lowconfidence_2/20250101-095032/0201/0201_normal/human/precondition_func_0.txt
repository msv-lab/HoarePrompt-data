n is an integer representing the number of districts (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), k is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (0 < k < n), and edges is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, where each tuple (u, v) indicates a direct path between districts u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
