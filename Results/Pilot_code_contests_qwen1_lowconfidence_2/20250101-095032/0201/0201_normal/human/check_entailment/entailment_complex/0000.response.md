Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input graph is not a tree. Specifically, the code assumes that the graph is connected and has exactly \( n-1 \) edges, which is correct. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the graph is a tree. While the annotations suggest that the graph is a tree, the code does not check for this condition. If the graph were not a tree (e.g., if there were cycles), the algorithm would fail because it relies on the properties of a tree structure. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
