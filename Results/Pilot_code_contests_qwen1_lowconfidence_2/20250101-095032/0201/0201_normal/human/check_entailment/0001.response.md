Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to be implementing some kind of tree traversal and node marking logic, but it does not appear to correctly handle the requirements of the problem. 

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3

Expected Output:
1 3 4
```

### Analysis:
1. **Tree Structure**: The given input describes a tree with 6 nodes (districts). The root is node 2, and the leaf nodes are 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Fan Count**: The fan count for each district is \(2^i\), so the fan counts are:
   - District 1: \(2^1 = 2\)
   - District 2: \(2^2 = 4\)
   - District 3: \(2^3 = 8\)
   - District 4: \(2^4 = 16\)
   - District 5: \(2^5 = 32\)
   - District 6: \(2^6 = 64\)

3. **Objective**: Remove 3 contestants such that the remaining contestants form a connected subtree and maximize the total fan count.

4. **Correct Solution**: To maximize the total fan count, we should remove the contestants from the leaf nodes with the smallest fan counts first. Thus, removing contestants from districts 1, 3, and 4 would give us the maximum fan count of \(4 + 64 + 32 = 100\).

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. For the given input, the program outputs a different set of districts to remove, indicating that it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the fan count while maintaining connectivity.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
