Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. The code constructs a tree-like structure and attempts to remove `k` districts, but it does not guarantee that the remaining districts form a connected component. The logic inside the loop where it tries to remove districts does not properly handle the connectivity requirement. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```

The expected output should be:

```
1 3 4
```

However, the provided code does not ensure that the remaining districts form a single connected component, which means it might incorrectly remove districts that would otherwise keep the remaining contestants connected. The code lacks the necessary logic to verify and maintain connectivity among the remaining districts after removals.
