Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to directly address the problem description. The function `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be solving the problem of selecting k contestants such that the remaining contestants are connected and the total number of fans is maximized. Instead, the functions involve complex operations on graph structures which do not align with the problem's requirements.

The problem description asks for a straightforward algorithm to select k contestants to remove while ensuring the remaining contestants form a connected component and maximizing the total number of fans. The given code does not provide such an algorithm. It seems more focused on manipulating a graph structure, which is not relevant to the actual problem.

To solve this problem correctly, one would typically use a greedy approach to remove the smallest fan districts until the required number of removals (k) is achieved, ensuring the remaining districts form a connected component. The current implementation does not reflect this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
