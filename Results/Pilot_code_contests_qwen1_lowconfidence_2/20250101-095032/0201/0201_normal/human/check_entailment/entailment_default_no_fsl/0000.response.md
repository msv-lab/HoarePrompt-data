Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the requirement to maximize the total number of fans among the remaining contestants. Instead, it appears to be trying to construct a tree-like structure and remove nodes without properly accounting for the fan count and the connectivity constraints.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Fan Count Consideration**: The problem specifies that the number of fans for a contestant from district \( i \) is \( 2^i \). The code does not account for this fan count in its logic for removing contestants.

2. **Connectivity Requirement**: The code needs to ensure that the remaining contestants are from districts that can still be reached from one another. This requires a more sophisticated approach to pruning the graph while maintaining connectivity, which the current implementation does not seem to handle.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic within the nested loops and conditionals in `func_1` does not reflect the problem requirements. For instance, the conditions `flag == 1` and the subsequent updates to the `nodes` list do not align with the goal of maximizing fan count while maintaining connectivity.

Given these points, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
