The code sets `abort` to `True`. This changes the value of `abort` from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
