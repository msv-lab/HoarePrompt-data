`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value `-1`. The initial state tells us that `new_nodes` is non-empty and `nodes[q + 1]` is `-1`, where `q` is the next node in `new_nodes`. After executing the code, the value of `nodes[p + 1]` is set to `-1`, but the value of `nodes[q + 1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[q + 1]` is -1, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
