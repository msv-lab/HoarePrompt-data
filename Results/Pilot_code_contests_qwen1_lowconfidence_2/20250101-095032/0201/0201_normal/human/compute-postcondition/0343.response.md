Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `total` is -1
   - `abort` is True
   - `new_nodes` is an empty list
   - `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited
   - `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list
   - `c` is less than 0
   - `-c` must be a positive integer

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = -c` to `j = -1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be in the range of `xrange(-c)`.

3. **Current State of `j`**:
   - Since the loop just exited, `j` must have reached the end of its range, i.e., `j` is -1.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be one less than -c, i.e., `j` should be -2.
   - Therefore, `-c` must be a positive integer (as given), and we need to ensure `j` is set to -2.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`total`, `abort`, `new_nodes`, `p`, `index`, `nodes`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop condition.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` must be -2.
- `-c` must still be a positive integer.

Thus, the updated state is:

**`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, and `-c` must be a positive integer.**

State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, and `-c` must be 2**
