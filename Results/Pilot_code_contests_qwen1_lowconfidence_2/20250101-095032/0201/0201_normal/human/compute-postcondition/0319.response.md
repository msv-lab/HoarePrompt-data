The code updates the value of `nodes[p + 1]` to `-1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `flag` is `-1`
- `abort` is `True`
- `new_nodes` contains at least one element
- `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected
- The program enters the if block because `abort` is `True`

After executing the line `nodes[p + 1] = -1`, the value of `nodes[p + 1]` is updated to `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
