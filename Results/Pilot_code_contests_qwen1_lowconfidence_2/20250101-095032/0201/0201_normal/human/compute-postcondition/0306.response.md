The variable `abort` is currently set to `True`. The code snippet `abort = True` does not change the value of `abort` since it is already `True`. The values of the other variables (`flag`, `new_nodes`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains [p], and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`**
