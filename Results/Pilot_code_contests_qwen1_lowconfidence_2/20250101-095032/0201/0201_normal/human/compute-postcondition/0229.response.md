The variable `abort` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the new value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1**
