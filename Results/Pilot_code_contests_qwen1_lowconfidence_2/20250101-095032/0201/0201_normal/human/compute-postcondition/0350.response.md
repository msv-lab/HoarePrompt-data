The code snippet `result = [i for i in xrange(1, n + 1) if nodes[i * 2 + 1] != 1]` creates a list comprehension that iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1` and checks if `nodes[i * 2 + 1]` is not equal to 1. If the condition is true, the value of `i` is added to the list `result`. 

However, the initial state does not provide the value of `n` or the exact values in `nodes`. We know that all nodes processed by the loop will have `nodes[p + 1]` set to `-1`, which means that for the indices processed in the loop, `nodes[p + 1]` will be `-1`. But since the loop that set these values has already run and the condition for setting `nodes[p + 1]` to `-1` is not mentioned in the new code, we cannot infer any direct changes to `nodes` from this code.

Given the current code, the values of `i`, `count`, `abort`, `p`, `index`, and `flag` are not affected. The only variable that might change is `result`, but without knowing the value of `n` or the contents of `nodes`, we cannot determine the exact content of `result`.

Output State: **`result` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `nodes[i * 2 + 1]` is not equal to 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 0, `abort` is True, `p` is the last value of `p` processed in the loop, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, and `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.**
