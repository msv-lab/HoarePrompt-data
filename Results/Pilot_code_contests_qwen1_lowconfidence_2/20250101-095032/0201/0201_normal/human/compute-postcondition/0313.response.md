The code `break` does not change any variable values; it simply exits the current loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the only impact is that we exit whatever construct we were inside. However, since no such construct is specified in the initial state, we can infer that the `break` statement is likely breaking out of an implicit loop or conditional block.

Given the initial state:
- `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`
- `abort` is `True`
- `new_nodes` contains `[p]`
- `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`
- `index` is `nodes[p]`

The `break` statement does not alter these values, but it indicates that we have exited the current loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is `True`, `new_nodes` contains `[p]`, `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`, `index` is `nodes[p]`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
