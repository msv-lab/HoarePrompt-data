The code snippet `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value of the element in the `nodes` list at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to -1. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `new_nodes` is an empty list, so `new_nodes[j]` would raise an `IndexError` if `j` is not within the bounds of `new_nodes`. However, since `j` is 1 and `new_nodes` is empty, this would not be a valid operation.

2. Given the conditions, `new_nodes` is an empty list, which means that the line of code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` will not execute because `new_nodes[j]` does not exist (since `new_nodes` is empty).

Since the code does not actually execute due to the precondition that `new_nodes` is an empty list, no changes are made to the variables.

Output State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, `-c` must be 2, and `j` is 1.**
