According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the contents of the `new_nodes` list. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[q + 1]` is -1, and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `new_nodes`.
2. **Variable Changes**: After the loop, `p` will take the value of the next element in `new_nodes`.

Since `new_nodes` is non-empty, it means there is at least one element left in the list. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `p` had the value of the current element in `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` will be set to the next element in `new_nodes`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `new_nodes` is still non-empty (it will still contain at least one element).
- `nodes[q + 1]` remains -1 (since this condition is not modified within the loop).
- `nodes[p + 1]` will now be -1 for the new value of `p`.

Given that `new_nodes` is non-empty, let's denote the next element in `new_nodes` as `next_p`. Since `p` was the last element processed, `next_p` will be the first element in `new_nodes` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[q + 1]` is -1, `nodes[next_p + 1]` is -1**
