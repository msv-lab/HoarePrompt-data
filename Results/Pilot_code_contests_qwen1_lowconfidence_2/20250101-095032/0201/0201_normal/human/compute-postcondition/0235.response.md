The code assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to `index`. The value of `p` is calculated as `index * 2`, which means `p` is now updated to the value of `nodes[index] * 2`. However, since the value of `index` was initially `nodes[p]` and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, we cannot determine the exact value of `index` without knowing the exact value of `nodes[p]`. But regardless of the value of `index`, the value of `p` is now `nodes[index] * 2`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1**
