Output State: **`t` is 0, `v` is `storage[lookup[index]] + 1`, `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, and `v` is the last value appended to the stack.** 

Explanation:
1. The loop continues as long as `t` is non-negative. Each iteration updates `t` to `storage[t]` and `v` to `storage[t + 1]`.
2. If `v` equals `parent_index`, the loop continues to the next iteration without making any further updates.
3. Otherwise, `nodes[v * 2]` is set to `index`, and `v` is appended to the stack.
4. The process repeats until `t` becomes 0, indicating the loop has completed all possible iterations based on the initial value of `t`.

Since `t` starts as `lookup[index]` and the loop continues until `t` becomes 0, the final state will have `t` as 0. The value of `v` will be the initial value of `storage[lookup[index]] + 1` because it gets updated each time through the loop. The assignment `nodes[v * 2] = index` ensures this value is stored in the `nodes` array. Finally, the value of `v` will be the last value appended to the stack, as no further updates occur after `t` becomes 0.
