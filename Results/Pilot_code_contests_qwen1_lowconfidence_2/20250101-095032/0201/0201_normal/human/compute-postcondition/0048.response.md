The code assigns the value of `storage[t + 1]` to `v`. The value of `v` is already known to be less than `4 * n`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length 2 * (n + 1) with nodes[v * 2] set to index, `stack` contains `v`, `stack_pop` is the pop method of stack, `stack_append` is the append method of stack, `index` is n, `parent_index` is nodes[n * 2], `t` is storage[storage[t + 1]], `v` is storage[t + 1], and `storage[t + 1]` must be less than 4 * n.**
