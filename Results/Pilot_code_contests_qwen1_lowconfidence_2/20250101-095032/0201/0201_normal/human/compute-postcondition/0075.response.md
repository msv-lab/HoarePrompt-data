`t` is greater than or equal to 0, so `t + 1` is also a valid index for the `storage` list. The code assigns the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list to the variable `v`. Since the exact value at index `t + 1` in `storage` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `v`, but we know that `v` now holds the value at `storage[t + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0; `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`**
