The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not show which loop this `continue` statement belongs to, nor does it provide the loop body. Without this context, we cannot determine exactly what changes are made to the variables during the loop iterations before encountering the `continue` statement.

Given the initial state and the fact that `continue` does not alter the values of any variables outside the loop, the only thing we can say is that the loop's execution is skipped for the current iteration.

Since no specific variables are altered by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros, `stack` is empty, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `nodes[n * 2]`, `t` is `storage[storage[t + 1]]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, and `v` is equal to `parent_index`. The loop is skipped for the current iteration.**
