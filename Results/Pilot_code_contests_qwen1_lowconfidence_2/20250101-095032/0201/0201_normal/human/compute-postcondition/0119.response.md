The code initializes an empty list named `new_nodes`. No changes are made to any other variables or lists. Therefore, the only updated variable is `new_nodes`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`stack` is empty, `t` is -1, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with each `nodes[v * 2]` set to the index of its parent in the tree structure, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is an integer, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is `n - k`, and `i` is `n`; `new_nodes` is an empty list.
