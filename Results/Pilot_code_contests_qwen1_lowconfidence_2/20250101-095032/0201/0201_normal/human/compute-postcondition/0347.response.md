Output State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, and `-c` is the final value of `-c` after the loop has executed.**

### Explanation:
- **`total`**: Remains `-1` because there is no update to `total` within the loop.
- **`abort`**: Remains `True` because there is no condition within the loop to change its value.
- **`new_nodes`**: Remains an empty list because there is no operation that modifies `new_nodes` inside the loop.
- **`p`**: Remains the last value of `p` before the loop exited, as `p` is not modified inside the loop.
- **`index`**: Remains the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, as `index` is not updated in the loop.
- **`nodes[p + 1]`**: Remains `-1` for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list because the loop sets `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to `-1` for each iteration, and since `new_nodes` is an empty list, no changes occur.
- **`c`**: Remains less than 0, and the value of `-c` will be the final count of iterations the loop executes. This is because the loop runs `for j in xrange(-c)` and `-c` must be a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations.

Since the loop runs `for j in xrange(-c)`, `-c` represents the number of times the loop executes. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, `-c` will be the final count of iterations.
