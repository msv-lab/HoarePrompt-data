The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` assigns the value of `index` to the element at the index `v * 2` in the list `nodes`. Given the initial state where `t` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`, and `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`, the values of `t` and `v` are unchanged by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`t` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `nodes[v * 2]` is assigned the value of `index`.**
