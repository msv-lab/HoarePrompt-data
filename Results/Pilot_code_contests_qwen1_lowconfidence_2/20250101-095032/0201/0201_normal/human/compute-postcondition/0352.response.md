The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts, with the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed, with the constraint \(0 < k < n\).
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple \((u, v)\) represents a direct path between districts \(u\) and \(v\), and both \(u\) and \(v\) are integers within the range \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\) and \(u \neq v\).

The function returns a value based on the input parameters and their relationships, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of tuples `edges`, and return a value based on the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer representing the number of districts), `k` (an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the connections between districts).**
