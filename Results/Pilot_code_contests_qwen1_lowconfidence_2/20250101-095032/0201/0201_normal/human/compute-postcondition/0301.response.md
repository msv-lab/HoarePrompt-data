The code `break` does not modify any variables but rather breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside. However, since no such context is provided, we assume it's breaking out of an implicit loop or conditional.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`flag` is `-1`; `abort` is `True`; `new_nodes` contains `[p]`; `index` is `nodes[p]`.**
