`t` is assigned the value of `lookup[index]`. The value of `t` was initially -1, but now it is updated to the value of `lookup[index]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `lookup[index]`, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with `nodes[index * 2]` potentially updated according to the loop logic, `stack` contains `stack` minus its last element, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`.**
