Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `j` is `-c - 1` regardless of the value of `c` since the else part is executed in all cases.***
