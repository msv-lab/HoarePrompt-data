`t` is initially equal to `storage[t + 1]`, and `storage[t + 1]` is greater than or equal to 0. Also, `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`. The code `t = storage[t]` updates the value of `t` to be the value stored at the index `t` in the `storage` list.

Since `t` was previously set to `storage[t + 1]`, and now `t` is updated to be `storage[t]`, the new value of `t` will be the value stored at the index `storage[t + 1]` in the `storage` list.

The value of `v` remains unchanged because it is not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is equal to `storage[storage[t + 1]]`; `storage[t + 1]` is greater than or equal to 0; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`**.
