The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the values of the variables `t`, `v`, `nodes[v * 2]`, and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that no changes occurred due to the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is now the value found in `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, `nodes[v * 2]` is still `index`**
