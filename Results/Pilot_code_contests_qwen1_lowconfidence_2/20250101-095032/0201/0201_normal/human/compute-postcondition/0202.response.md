The code snippet sets `abort` to `True`. This changes the value of `abort` from its initial state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\), `abort` is `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the condition `flag == -1` is true.**
