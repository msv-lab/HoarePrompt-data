Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` must be `False`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Since the if condition `flag == 1` is the only condition provided and the else part is not specified, the postcondition remains unchanged if `flag` equals 1.***
