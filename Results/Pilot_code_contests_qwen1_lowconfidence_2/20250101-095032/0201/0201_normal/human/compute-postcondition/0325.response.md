The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the loop body. Since the code only contains `continue`, it does not affect the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list.**
