The code `continue` is used to continue to the next iteration of a loop without executing the remaining part of the current iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the example, the execution of `continue` does not change any variable values from their previous states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, and the current value of `v` is equal to `parent_index`**
