The code `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. Here, `p` is an element from the list `new_nodes`. Given that `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1 for each `p` in `new_nodes`, and since the assignment does not modify `nodes[p + 1]` directly, the value of `nodes[p + 1]` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`new_nodes`, `parent_index`, `count`, `i`, `abort`, `j`, and `c`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a non-empty list with an additional element `p`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is 1 if the if condition `flag == -1` is false (i.e., `flag` becomes 1) or remains -1 if the if condition is true (i.e., `flag` remains -1), and `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` for the current `p` in `new_nodes`.**
