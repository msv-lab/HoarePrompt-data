The value of `storage_index` is incremented by 2. Initially, `storage_index` was `storage_index + 8`, so after adding 2, the new value of `storage_index` is `(storage_index + 8) + 2`, which simplifies to `storage_index + 10`.

The values of `storage[storage_index]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]`, and `lookup[u]` and `lookup[v]` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 10`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`.
Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 10`, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
