To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and analyze the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
  - `new_nodes` is non-empty.
  - For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.
  - `parent_index` is an integer.
  - `count` is 0.
  - `i` is `n - 1`.
  - `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0.
  - `j` is \(-c - 1\).
  - `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.
  - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`.

- **Loop Condition:**
  - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `n` to 1 (inclusive), decreasing by 1 each time (`xrange(n, 0, -1)`).

### Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i > 0`. 

3. **Possible Changes During the Loop:**
   - Based on the given conditions, the loop may update `nodes`, `new_nodes`, `count`, `parent_index`, `abort`, `j`, `flag`, and `c`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- **`i` Value:**
  - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, for the next iteration, `i` would be `n - 2`.

- **Other Variables:**
  - `new_nodes`, `nodes`, `parent_index`, `count`, `abort`, `j`, `flag`, and `c` might change based on the loop body. However, without the actual loop body, we cannot specify these changes directly.

- **Loop Continuation Condition:**
  - The loop continues as long as `i > 0`. Therefore, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 2` for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
- **States to Adjust:**
  - `i` should be `n - 2` (decremented by 1 from `n - 1`).

### Final State:
- **New State:**
  - `new_nodes` remains unchanged (non-empty).
  - `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1.
  - `parent_index` remains unchanged.
  - `count` remains unchanged (0).
  - `i` is now `n - 2`.
  - `abort` remains `True`.
  - `j` is \(-c - 1\), but `c` is dependent on the loop body.
  - `flag` is either -1 or 1, depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.
  - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and it will be recalculated in the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1, and `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`**.
