Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `new_nodes` is non-empty.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` is -1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = -c` to `j = -1` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `j` is in the range `-c` to `-1`.

3. **Current Iteration End State:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since the loop runs from `-c` to `-1`, the current value of `j` is `-c - 1` (the last value before the next iteration starts).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The variable `j` will be incremented to `-c - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` being -1 does not change within the loop itself; it remains the same.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `new_nodes` is still non-empty.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` is still -1.
   - `j` will be `-c - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` is -1, `j` is -c - 1**
