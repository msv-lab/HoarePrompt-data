Postcondition: `new_nodes` is non-empty, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the final value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the final value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0, `j` is \(-c - 1\), and `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit; `c` is less than 0.
