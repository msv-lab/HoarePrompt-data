The code assigns `storage[t + 1]` to `t`. Given that `storage[t + 1]` is less than 4 * n, the value of `t` will be updated to `storage[t + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length 2 * (n + 1) with nodes[v * 2] set to n, `stack` contains `v` appended, `stack_pop` is the pop method of stack, `stack_append` is the append method of stack, `index` is n, `parent_index` is nodes[n * 2], `t` is `storage[t + 1]`, and `v` is now `storage[t + 1]` with `storage[t + 1]` being less than 4 * n.**
