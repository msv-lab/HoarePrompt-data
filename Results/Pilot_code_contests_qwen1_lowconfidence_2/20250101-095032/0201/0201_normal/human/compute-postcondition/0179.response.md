According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. The loop will continue as long as `new_nodes` is not an empty list. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` is not an empty list, and `nodes[1]` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `new_nodes` must still not be an empty list. There is no direct impact on `nodes[1]` from the loop condition itself, but we keep it in the state as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`new_nodes` is not an empty list, `nodes[1]` is 1**
