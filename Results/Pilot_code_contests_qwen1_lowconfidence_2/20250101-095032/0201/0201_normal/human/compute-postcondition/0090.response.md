The code `index = stack_pop()` pops an element from the stack and assigns it to `index`. This changes the value of `index` but does not affect the other variables' values or their relationships.

- `t` remains `-1`.
- `storage` is unchanged.
- `storage_index` is unchanged.
- `lookup` is unchanged.
- `edges` is unchanged.
- `nodes` is unchanged, except that `nodes[index * 2]` may be updated later in the code.
- `stack` loses its last element, which was `index`.
- `stack_pop` is now the new top of the stack.
- `stack_append` is unchanged.
- `index` is now the value previously popped from the stack.
- `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is -1, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with `nodes[index * 2]` potentially updated according to the loop logic, `stack` contains `stack` minus its last element, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`.**
