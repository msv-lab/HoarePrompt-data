Postcondition: ***`storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros, `stack` is empty, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `nodes[n * 2]`, `t` is `storage[storage[t + 1]]`, and `v` is `storage[t + 1]`. If `v` is equal to `parent_index`, the loop is skipped for the current iteration. Since there is no else part, the conditions and states remain as described above.***
