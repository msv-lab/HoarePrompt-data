The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since there are no loops or conditional statements in the given code snippet that would affect the variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains [p], and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
