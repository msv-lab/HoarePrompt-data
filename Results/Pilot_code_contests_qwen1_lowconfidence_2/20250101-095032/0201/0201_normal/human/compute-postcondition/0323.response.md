The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element at the index `p + 1` in the list `nodes`. Given the initial state, `nodes[p + 1]` was previously `-1`, so this assignment does not change its value. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `p` is the second element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
