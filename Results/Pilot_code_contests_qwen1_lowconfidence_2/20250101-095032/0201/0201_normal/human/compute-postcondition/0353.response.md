Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of districts), `k` (the number of contestants to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the connections between districts). It constructs a data structure using the `storage` and `lookup` lists to represent the connections between districts. Then, it builds a tree-like structure using the `nodes` list, where each node's left child is stored in `nodes[v * 2]` and the right child in `nodes[v * 2 + 1]`. After constructing the tree, it removes `k` districts (contestants) and updates the `nodes` list accordingly. Finally, it prints the remaining districts that are not removed.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `0 < k < n`. If `k` is equal to `n`, the function will remove all districts, leaving no output. This should be handled appropriately, perhaps by raising an error or returning an empty list.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the input `edges` might form a disconnected graph. In such cases, the tree structure might not be fully connected, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- The function does not check if the `edges` list is valid, meaning it does not verify that each tuple `(u, v)` is within the range `[1, n]` and that `u ≠ v`. If invalid edges are provided, the function might behave incorrectly.
- The function does not handle the case where `k` is zero, which would mean no districts are removed, and the function would simply print all districts. This is already handled correctly by the current logic.
