Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have executed.

### Initial State
- `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\)
- `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\)
- `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\)
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts
- `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) filled with zeros
- `stack` is empty
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is \(n\)
- `parent_index` is `nodes[n * 2]`
- `t` is `lookup[n]`

### Loop Code
```python
while t >= 0:
    v = storage[t + 1]
    t = storage[t]
    if v == parent_index:
        continue
    nodes[v * 2] = index
    stack_append(v)
```

### Observations from Example Outputs
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `nodes[v * 2]` is set to `index`.
   - `stack` is updated with `v`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `nodes[v * 2]` remains set to `n`.
   - `stack` is updated with another value of `v`.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `nodes[v * 2]` remains set to `n`.
   - `stack` is updated with yet another value of `v`.

From these observations, we can infer that the loop continues until `t` becomes negative. Each iteration sets `nodes[v * 2]` to the current value of `index` and pushes `v` onto the stack.

### Final State Analysis
- **`storage`:** Remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it directly. It only reads from it.
- **`storage_index`:** Remains unchanged.
- **`lookup`:** Remains unchanged.
- **`edges`:** Remains unchanged.
- **`nodes`:** Each node \(v\) encountered during the loop will have its corresponding `nodes[v * 2]` set to the current value of `index` when the loop exits.
- **`stack`:** Contains a sequence of values of `v` encountered during the loop.
- **`stack_pop`:** Remains the `pop` method of `stack`.
- **`stack_append`:** Remains the `append` method of `stack`.
- **`index`:** Will be the last value of `index` when the loop exits. Since `index` starts at \(n\) and increments each time it is used in the loop, the final value of `index` will be the number of iterations the loop performed.
- **`parent_index`:** Will be the value of `nodes[n * 2]` when the loop exits.
- **`t`:** Will be a negative value when the loop exits, indicating that no more elements can be processed.

### Output State
Given the above analysis, the final state of the loop can be described as follows:

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with nodes[v * 2] set to the last value of `index` for each v encountered, `stack` contains a sequence of values of `v` encountered during the loop, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the number of iterations the loop performed, `parent_index` is nodes[n * 2], `t` is a negative value.**
