Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `new_nodes` is non-empty.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1.
   - `j` is \(-c - 1\).

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in xrange(-c):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from \( j = -c - 1 \) to \( j = -1 \). This means it will run \( c \) times (since \( j \) goes from \(-c - 1\) to \(-2, -1\)).

4. **Current State:**
   - `j` is \(-c - 1\), meaning we are at the very first iteration of the loop (or the last iteration of the previous loop).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, \( j \) will be incremented by 1, making \( j = -c \).
   - For the loop to continue, \( j \) needs to be within the range \([-c, -2, -1]\).

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `new_nodes` remains non-empty as the loop body is not specified to modify this list.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` must still be -1 for the condition to hold true in the next iteration.
   - `j` is now \(-c\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1, `j` is \(-c\)**
