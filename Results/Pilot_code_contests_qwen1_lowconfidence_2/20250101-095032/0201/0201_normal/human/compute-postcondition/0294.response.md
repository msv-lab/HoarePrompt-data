`abort` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `flag` is initially `nodes[p + 1]`, but this variable is not affected by the assignment of `abort`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `abort` with the value `True`.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is `True`**
