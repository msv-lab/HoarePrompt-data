The code initializes a stack with the value of `n`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the stack now contains the value of `n`, while the other variables retain their original states.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n where each pair of elements corresponds to a district and its connection, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element points to the corresponding position in `storage`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros, `stack` is `[n]`.**
