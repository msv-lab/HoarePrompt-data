According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and `new_nodes`. The loop will execute if there are more elements in `new_nodes` to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1. This tells us that `p` was one of the values in `new_nodes` that was processed, and `nodes[p + 1]` was updated to 1 as a result of the loop body execution.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another value in `new_nodes` that hasn't been processed yet. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes`.

State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is 1, and `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes`**.

To be precise, if the current `p` value was the last element in `new_nodes`, then `new_nodes` should still have at least one element left for the loop to execute again. However, without knowing the exact current value of `p`, we can only say that `p` should be set to the next value in `new_nodes`.

State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes`**.
