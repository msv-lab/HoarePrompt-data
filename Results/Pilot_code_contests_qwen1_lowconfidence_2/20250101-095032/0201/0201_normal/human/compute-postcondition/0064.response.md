The code assigns the value of `nodes[index * 2]` to `parent_index`. Since `index` was previously popped from the stack, it is now stored in `index`. The value of `nodes[index * 2]` is already defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the value of `parent_index` is now `nodes[index * 2]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with nodes[v * 2] set to the last value of `index` for each v encountered, `stack` now contains one less element than before, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is a negative value**
