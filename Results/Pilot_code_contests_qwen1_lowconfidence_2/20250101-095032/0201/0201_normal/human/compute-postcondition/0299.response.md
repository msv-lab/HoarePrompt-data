`new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. The value of `p` does not change, and neither does the value of `flag` or `abort`. The only change is that `p` is added to `new_nodes`.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`; if `flag` equals -1, then `abort` is set to `True`; if `flag` equals 1, the state remains unchanged; therefore, `abort` remains `True` if `flag` is -1, and the state remains unchanged if `flag` is 1; `new_nodes` contains the value of `p` appended to its list.**
