The code sets `nodes[p + 1]` to `-1`. The initial state specifies that `new_nodes` contains at least one element and `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`. Since `nodes[p + 1]` is already `-1`, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
