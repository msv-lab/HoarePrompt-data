`t` is assigned the value of `lookup[index]`. The value of `lookup[index]` is dependent on the value of `index`, which was previously the value popped from the stack. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated value of `t` is `lookup[index]`.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with nodes[v * 2] set to the last value of `index` for each v encountered, `stack` now contains one less element than before, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is `lookup[index]`**.
