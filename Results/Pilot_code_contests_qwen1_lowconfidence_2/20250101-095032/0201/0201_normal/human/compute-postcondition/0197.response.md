The code `p = i * 2` assigns the value of `i * 2` to the variable `p`. Given that `i` is initially set to `n - 1`, the new value of `p` will be `(n - 1) * 2`.

Let's list the changes and keep the rest of the variables as they are:

- `new_nodes` remains an empty list.
- `nodes[p + 1]` remains `-1` because `p` does not get added to `new_nodes` in this line of code.
- `index` remains the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited.
- `parent_index` remains an integer.
- `count` remains `n - k`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `p` is now updated to `(n - 1) * 2`.
- `abort` remains `True`.
- `j` remains \(-c - 1\).

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\), `abort` is `True`, and `j` is \(-c - 1\).**
