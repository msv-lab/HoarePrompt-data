The code `nodes[p + 1] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element at index `p + 1` in the list `nodes`. Given that `nodes[1]` is initially 1 (assuming the first element in `new_nodes` was 0, thus `p_current + 1 = 1`), the value of `p` must be 0. Therefore, the value at `nodes[0 + 1]` (which is `nodes[1]`) will be updated to 1. Since `nodes[1]` was already 1, updating it does not change its value.

The output state is:
Output State: **`new_nodes` is not an empty list, `nodes[1]` is 1**
