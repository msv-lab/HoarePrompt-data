Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `new_nodes` is an empty list.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited.
- `parent_index` is an integer.
- `count` is \( n - k \).
- `i` is \( n \).
- `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1.

### For Loop:
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the range `xrange(-c)`, which means it will iterate from -c to -1 (inclusive). The loop will execute as long as `j` is within this range.

2. **Current Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just finished with the final value of `j`. Let's denote the current value of `j` as \( j_{\text{prev}} \).

3. **Next Value of `j`**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be \( j_{\text{prev}} - 1 \). Since the loop is iterating over negative values, the next value will be the next smallest negative number, which is \( j_{\text{prev}} - 1 \).

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - The value of `j` will be updated to \( j_{\text{prev}} - 1 \).
   - The variable `abort` remains `True` unless explicitly changed inside the loop body, but since no changes are mentioned, we assume `abort` remains `True`.

### Updated State:
- `new_nodes` remains an empty list.
- `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution.
- `index` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `parent_index` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `count` remains \( n - k \) as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` remains \( n \) as it is not affected by the loop.
- `p` remains `nodes[index] * 2` as it is not affected by the loop.
- `abort` remains `True`.
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1 for the previous value of `j`, so for the new value of `j`, it will be updated accordingly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \( n - k \), `i` is \( n \), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1 for the previous value of `j` and will be updated for the new value of `j`**.
