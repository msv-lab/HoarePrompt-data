Let's analyze the given loop and the initial state step by step to determine the final state after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `new_nodes` remains unchanged (non-empty)
- `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1
- `parent_index` remains unchanged
- `count` remains unchanged (0)
- `i` is now `n - 2`
- `abort` is `False`
- `j` is \(-c - 1\)
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`
- `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit
- `p` is `(n - 2) * 2`

### Loop Code
```python
while True:
    flag = nodes[p + 1]
    if flag == -1:
        abort = True
        break
    elif flag == 1:
        break
    new_nodes.append(p)
    index = nodes[p]
    if index <= 0:
        break
    p = index * 2
```

### Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `p` starts as `(n - 2) * 2`.
   - `flag = nodes[p + 1]`.
   - If `flag == -1`, `abort = True` and the loop breaks.
   - If `flag == 1`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `new_nodes.append(p)` is called.
   - `index = nodes[p]`.
   - If `index <= 0`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `p` is updated to `index * 2`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - Each iteration involves checking `flag`, adding `p` to `new_nodes`, and updating `p` to `nodes[p] * 2` until one of the conditions (`flag == -1` or `index <= 0`) is met.

### Loop Execution
- The loop continues appending `p` to `new_nodes` and updating `p` to `nodes[p] * 2` until `flag == -1` or `index <= 0`.

### Final State
- Once `flag == -1`, `abort` becomes `True` and the loop breaks.
- `new_nodes` contains all the values of `p` that were added during the loop iterations.
- `p` will be the last value of `p` before the loop exited due to `flag == -1`.
- `index` will be the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected.

### Output State
Since the loop exits when `flag == -1`, the final state will be:
- `flag` is `-1`
- `abort` is `True`
- `new_nodes` contains all the values of `p` added during the loop
- `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`flag` is `-1`, `abort` is `True`, `new_nodes` contains all previously added values of `p`, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected.**
