The code appends the value of `p` to `new_nodes`. Given the initial state, `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`. Therefore, `new_nodes` will contain `[p, p]`.

However, we also need to consider the condition to break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. The condition is that if `flag == -1` or `flag == 1`, we break out of the loop. Since `flag` is either `-1` or `1`, the code will break out of the loop before appending `p` to `new_nodes`. Thus, `new_nodes` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains [p], and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`**
