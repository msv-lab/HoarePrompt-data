`stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. Since `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`, the stack now contains `storage[t + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is equal to `storage[storage[t + 1]]`; `storage[t + 1]` is greater than or equal to 0; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; `nodes[v * 2]` is assigned `index`; the stack contains `storage[t + 1]`**
