The code assigns the value of `index` to `nodes[v * 2]`. Based on the initial state, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, so `nodes[v * 2]` becomes `nodes[storage[t + 1] * 2]`. The values of `t` and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, `nodes[storage[t + 1] * 2]` is `index`.**
