The code updates the value of `lookup[u]` to be `storage_index`. This affects `lookup[u]` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `v`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`**
