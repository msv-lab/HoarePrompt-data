According to the code, the loop iterates from `-c` to `0`. The loop variable `j` starts from `-c` and increments by 1 until it reaches 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `total` is -1
- `abort` is True
- `new_nodes` is an empty list
- `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list
- `c` is less than 0
- `-c` must be 2 (since `c` is less than 0, `-c` is positive and equals 2)

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `j` must be within the range specified by `-c` to 0. Since `-c` is 2, `j` should start from 1 and go down to 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be 1 (since it starts from -c, which is 2, and decrements by 1 each time).
- `total` remains -1.
- `abort` remains True.
- `new_nodes` remains an empty list.
- `p` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `index` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list.
- `c` remains less than 0.
- `-c` remains 2.

State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, `-c` must be 2, and `j` is 1**
