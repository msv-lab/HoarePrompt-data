The code `c = count - len(new_nodes)` subtracts the length of the `new_nodes` list from the value of `count`. Given the initial state, `new_nodes` is empty (hence `len(new_nodes) = 0`), and `count` is \(n - k\). Therefore, `c` will be equal to \(n - k - 0 = n - k\).

- `new_nodes` remains empty.
- `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution.
- `index` remains the value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited.
- `parent_index` remains an integer.
- `count` remains \(n - k\).
- `i` remains \(n\).
- `p` remains `nodes[index] * 2`.
- `abort` remains `True`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, and `abort` is `True`; `c` is \(n - k\).**
