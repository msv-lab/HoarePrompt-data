The code assigns the value `-1` to `nodes[p + 1]`. The initial state is that `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. The value of `new_nodes` is not affected, and the value of `p` is not specified, but it is used in the index `p + 1`.

Since `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, we know its value is unchanged. The value of `nodes` at index `p + 1` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
