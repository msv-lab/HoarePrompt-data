Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while True` loop to execute one more time.

Given the initial state:
- `new_nodes` is an empty list
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1
- `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited
- `parent_index` is an integer
- `count` is \(n - k\)
- `i` is \(n - 1\)
- `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\)
- `abort` is `False`
- `j` is \(-c - 1\)

The loop condition for the `while True` loop is always true, meaning the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Since the loop condition is always true (`while True`), no specific adjustments to the states are necessary to ensure the loop executes one more time. The loop will continue to run indefinitely unless explicitly terminated within the loop body.

Therefore, the state remains as provided.

State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\), `abort` is `False`, and `j` is \(-c - 1\)**
