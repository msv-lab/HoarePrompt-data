Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Since the if condition `index <= 0` is checked and the if part matches this condition, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
