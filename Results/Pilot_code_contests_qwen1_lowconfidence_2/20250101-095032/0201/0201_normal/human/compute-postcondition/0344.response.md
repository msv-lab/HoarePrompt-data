The code updates the value of `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to `-1`. Since `new_nodes` is an empty list, there are no elements to iterate over, meaning the index `j` does not exist. As a result, the line of code does not affect any existing values in `nodes`.

Output State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, and `-c` must be 2.**
