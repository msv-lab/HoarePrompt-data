Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is non-empty, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and the final state of the program depends on whether `c \geq 0`. If `c \geq 0`, then `nodes[p + 1]` is 1 for all `p` in `new_nodes`. Otherwise, `new_nodes` remains unchanged.***
