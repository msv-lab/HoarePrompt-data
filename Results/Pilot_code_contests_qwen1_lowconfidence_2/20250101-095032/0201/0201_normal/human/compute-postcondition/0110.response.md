The code `t = storage[t]` updates the value of `t` to the value stored in `storage[t]`. Given the initial state, `t` is currently `storage[t]` and `storage[t]` is non-negative, so `t` will be updated to the value found in `storage[t]`. The value of `v` and `nodes[v * 2]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is now the value found in `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, `nodes[v * 2]` is still `index`**
