Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the new value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1. Since the if condition `flag == 1` is not specified to change any of these variables and no else part exists, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
