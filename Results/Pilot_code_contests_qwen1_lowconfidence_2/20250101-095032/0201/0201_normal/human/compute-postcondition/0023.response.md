The code updates the value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` to `v`. Let's break down the changes:

- Initially, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is the next `u` value from `edges`.
- After running the code, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is now set to `v`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 6`, `lookup[u]` is updated based on the next `u` value, `lookup[v]` is updated based on the next `v` value**
