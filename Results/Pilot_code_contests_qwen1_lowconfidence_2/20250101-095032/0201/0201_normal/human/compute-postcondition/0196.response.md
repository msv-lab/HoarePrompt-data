The code `new_nodes = []` initializes `new_nodes` as an empty list. This means that `new_nodes` is now an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `j` is \(-c - 1\).**
