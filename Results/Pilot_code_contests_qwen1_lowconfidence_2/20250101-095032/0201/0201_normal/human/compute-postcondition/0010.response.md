`lookup[v]` is assigned the value `storage_index`. This updates the value of `lookup[v]` from `storage[storage_index]` to `storage_index`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[v]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index**
