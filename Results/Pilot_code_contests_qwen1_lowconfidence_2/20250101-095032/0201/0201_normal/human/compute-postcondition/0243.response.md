According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `new_nodes` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` is non-empty, and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
1. `new_nodes` must still be non-empty because if it becomes empty, the loop will terminate.
2. The value of `p` must refer to the next node in `new_nodes`, and `nodes[p + 1]` must be -1 for the loop to continue.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `new_nodes` remains non-empty.
- `p` refers to the next node in `new_nodes`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.

Let's assume the next node in `new_nodes` is `q`. Therefore, `p` would be set to `q`, and `nodes[q + 1]` should be -1.

State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[q + 1]` is -1, where `q` is the next node in `new_nodes`**
