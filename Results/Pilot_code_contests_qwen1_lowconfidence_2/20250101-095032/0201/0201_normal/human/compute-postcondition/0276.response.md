Let's analyze the given state and the `while True` loop step by step.

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `new_nodes` remains non-empty.
- For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.
- `parent_index` remains unchanged.
- `count` remains 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `abort` is `False`.
- `j` is \(-c - 1\).
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`.
- `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.
- `p` is `(n - 2) * 2`.

### Analysis of the `while True` Loop:
- The `while True` loop will continue to execute as long as it doesn't encounter a break statement or any condition that sets `abort` to `True`.

### Conditions to Execute the Loop:
- Since the loop is `while True`, the loop will always execute unless there is an explicit condition that stops it. Therefore, no state adjustment is necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once.

### Conclusion:
The loop will always execute because it is a `while True` loop. No state needs to be adjusted.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` remains non-empty, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is `False`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit, and `p` is `(n - 2) * 2`**.
