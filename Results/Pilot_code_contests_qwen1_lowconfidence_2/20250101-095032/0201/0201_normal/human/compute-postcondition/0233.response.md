Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the new value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (if `flag == -1`) or the postcondition remains unchanged (if the if condition `flag == -1` is not met).***
