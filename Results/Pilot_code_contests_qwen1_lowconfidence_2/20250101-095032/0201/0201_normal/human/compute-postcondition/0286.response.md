The code appends the value `p` to the list `new_nodes`. The previous state of `new_nodes` is non-empty, meaning it contains at least one element. Since `p` is being appended, `new_nodes` will now contain one additional element, which is `p`. 

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1.
- `parent_index` remains unchanged.
- `count` remains 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively.
- `j` is \(-c - 1\).
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`.
- `flag` is 1 if the if condition `flag == -1` is false (i.e., `flag` becomes 1) or remains -1 if the if condition is true (i.e., `flag` remains -1).

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a non-empty list with an additional element `p`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and `flag` is 1 if the if condition `flag == -1` is false (i.e., `flag` becomes 1) or remains -1 if the if condition is true (i.e., `flag` remains -1).**
