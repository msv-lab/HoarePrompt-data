Output State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `j` is \(-c - 1\)**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from \(-c\) (inclusive) to 0 (exclusive).
- Each iteration sets `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to -1.
- After the loop finishes, `j` will be \(-c - 1\).

Since the loop always iterates exactly \(-c\) times (as long as \(-c\) is a valid index range), the final state of the variables after the loop is:
- `new_nodes` remains non-empty.
- For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to -1.
- `j` will be \(-c - 1\).
