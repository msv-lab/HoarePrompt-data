The code `index = stack_pop()` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns it to `index`. Since `stack` is initially `[n]`, popping the last element will assign `n` to `index` and make `stack` empty.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n where each pair of elements corresponds to a district and its connection, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element points to the corresponding position in `storage`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros, `stack` is empty, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`**
