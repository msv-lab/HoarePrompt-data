The code assigns `-1` to `nodes[p + 1]`. This changes the value of `nodes[p + 1]` from its previous value, which was not specified but known to be non-empty initially, to `-1`. The other variables (`new_nodes`, `nodes[q + 1]`, and `nodes[next_p + 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[q + 1]` is -1, `nodes[next_p + 1]` is -1, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
