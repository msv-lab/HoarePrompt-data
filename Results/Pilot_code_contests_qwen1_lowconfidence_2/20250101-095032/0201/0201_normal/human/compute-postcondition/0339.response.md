Postcondition: ***`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is a list where each element's corresponding node in `nodes` has its index+1 set to 1, `p` is the last value of `p` processed in the loop, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1 for all elements in `new_nodes`, `count` is equal to `c` and is equal to 0.***
