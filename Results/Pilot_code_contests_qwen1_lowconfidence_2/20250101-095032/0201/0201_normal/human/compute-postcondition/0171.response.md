The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the given code snippet does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to, and no variables are being directly modified within the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must be empty, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `new_nodes` is a list that originally contained the indices of nodes that were modified during the loop, and `abort` is `True`.**
