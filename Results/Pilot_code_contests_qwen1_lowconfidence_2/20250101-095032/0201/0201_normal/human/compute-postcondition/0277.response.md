The code assigns the value of `nodes[p + 1]` to the variable `flag`. Given that `p` is `(n - 2)` and `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, the value of `nodes[p + 1]` when `p` is `(n - 2)` is also -1. Therefore, `flag` is set to -1.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`new_nodes` remains non-empty, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is `False`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is -1, and `p` is `(n - 2) * 2`.**
