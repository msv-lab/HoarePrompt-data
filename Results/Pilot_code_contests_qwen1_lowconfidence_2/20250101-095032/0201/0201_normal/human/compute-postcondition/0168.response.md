According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the list `new_nodes`. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` contains at least one element, and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be the first element of `new_nodes`, and `nodes[p + 1]` must still be -1.

To summarize:

- The loop will continue if `new_nodes` contains at least one element and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.
- After the loop, `p` will be set to the first element of `new_nodes`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`new_nodes` contains at least two elements (since `p` is now the first element), `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, and `p` is the first element of `new_nodes`**.

However, since we only need to state the modified part based on the given information:

State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, and `p` is the first element of `new_nodes`**.
