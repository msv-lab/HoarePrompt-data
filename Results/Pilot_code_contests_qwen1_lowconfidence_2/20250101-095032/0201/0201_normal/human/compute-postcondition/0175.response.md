To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `new_nodes` is an empty list.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited.
- `parent_index` is an integer.
- `count` is \(n - k\).
- `i` is \(n\).
- `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`.
- `abort` is `True`.
- The current value of `c` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Requirements for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop `for p in new_nodes:` requires that `new_nodes` is not empty. Since the problem states that `new_nodes` is currently an empty list, this is the key condition that needs to be adjusted.

### Adjusted States:
- `new_nodes` must not be an empty list; it must contain at least one element.

### Other Considerations:
- The values of `nodes[p + 1]` will be set to -1 for the elements in `new_nodes` during the loop execution. However, since `new_nodes` is initially empty, no such elements exist yet.
- `index`, `parent_index`, `count`, `i`, `p`, and `abort` do not affect whether the loop starts as they are not part of the initial conditions for the loop to execute.
- The value of `c` being greater than or equal to 0 does not affect the loop execution either.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` is not an empty list**.

In summary, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `new_nodes` is not an empty list.
