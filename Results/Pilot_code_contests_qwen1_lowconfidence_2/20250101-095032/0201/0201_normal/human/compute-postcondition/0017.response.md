Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index - 2`
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`
   - `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined
   - `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`
   - `edges` is a non-empty list
   - `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`
   - `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   storage[storage_index] = lookup[v]
   ```

3. The variable `storage[storage_index]` is updated to the value of `lookup[v]`. Given that `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`, this means:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is now `storage_index`.

So, after executing the code, the updated state is:
- `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`
- `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`
- `edges` is a non-empty list
- `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`
- `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
