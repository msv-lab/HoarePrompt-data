The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the provided code snippet does not include a loop context, which means the `continue` statement will simply be ignored since it cannot be properly executed without a loop structure.

Given that the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values or perform any actions outside of its intended loop context, the values of the variables `t` and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is now equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`**
