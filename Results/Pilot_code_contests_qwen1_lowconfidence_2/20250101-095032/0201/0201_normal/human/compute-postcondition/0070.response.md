The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables but rather affects the flow of control, no variables are updated by this statement. The current values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with nodes[v * 2] set to the last value of `index` for each v encountered, `stack` now contains one less element than before, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `v` is the value at index \(t + 1\) in the `storage` list, and \(t\) is the value at index \(t\) in the `storage` list. The current value of \(v\) is equal to the current value of `parent_index`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
