The code `v = storage[t + 1]` assigns the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list to the variable `v`. No other variables are affected.

- The length of `storage` remains \(4 \times n\).
- `storage_index` remains \(4 \times n\).
- `lookup` remains a list of length \(n + 1\).
- `edges` remains unchanged.
- `nodes` remains a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with nodes[v * 2] set to the last value of `index` for each v encountered.
- `stack` now contains one less element than before, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, and `t` remains greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with nodes[v * 2] set to the last value of `index` for each v encountered, `stack` now contains one less element than before, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `v` is the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
