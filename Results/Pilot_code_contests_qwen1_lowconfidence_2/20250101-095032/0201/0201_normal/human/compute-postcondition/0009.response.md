The code assigns the value of `u` to `storage[storage_index + 1]`. According to the initial state, `storage[storage_index + 1]` was previously `v`. So, `storage[storage_index + 1]` will now be `u`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is now `lookup[v]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`**
