According to the code, the loop iterates over each value in `new_nodes` using the variable `p`. At the end of the previous iteration, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, and `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Current Value of `p`:** Since `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes` after each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `p` is now pointing to the next element in `new_nodes`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop continues as long as there are values left in `new_nodes`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be set to the next value in `new_nodes`.

Given these points, we can conclude that at the start of the next iteration:
- `p` will be set to the next value in `new_nodes`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` will be checked, and it is expected to be 1 again for the condition to hold.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes`**
