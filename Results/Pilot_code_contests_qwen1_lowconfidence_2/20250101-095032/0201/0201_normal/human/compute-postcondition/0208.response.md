Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\), `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition of the if statement, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.***
