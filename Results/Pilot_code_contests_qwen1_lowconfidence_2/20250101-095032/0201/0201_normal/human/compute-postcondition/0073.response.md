The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. Given that `stack` now contains one less element than before, appending `v` means that `stack` now contains one more element than it did before. 

The states of all other variables remain unchanged:
- `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\)
- `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\)
- `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\)
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts
- `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with `nodes[v * 2]` updated to `index`
- `stack` now contains one more element than before
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is the value previously popped from the stack
- `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`
- `v` is the value at index \(t + 1\) in the `storage` list
- \(t\) is the value at index \(t\) in the `storage` list

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\); `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\); `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\); `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts; `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with `nodes[v * 2]` updated to `index`; `stack` now contains one more element than before; `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`; `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`; `index` is the value previously popped from the stack; `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`; `v` is the value at index \(t + 1\) in the `storage` list; \(t\) is the value at index \(t\) in the `storage` list**.
