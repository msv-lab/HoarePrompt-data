`storage_index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `storage_index` was `storage_index + 6`, so the new value of `storage_index` is `(storage_index + 6) + 2 = storage_index + 8`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 8`, `lookup[u]` is updated to `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is updated based on the next `v` value**
