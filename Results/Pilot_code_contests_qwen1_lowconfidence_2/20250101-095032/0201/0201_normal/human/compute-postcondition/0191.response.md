To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `new_nodes` is an empty list.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is set to -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited.
- `parent_index` is an integer.
- `count` is \( n - k \).
- `i` is \( n \).
- `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is set to -1 for the value of `j` that was added to `new_nodes` within the loop.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from `j = -1` to `j = -c - 1` (inclusive). This means it will run `-c` times if `c` is positive, or once if `c` is -1, and so on.

2. **Initialization and Execution**:
   - At the start of the loop, `j` is `-1`.
   - For each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 until it reaches `-c`.

3. **Loop Exit Condition**:
   - The loop exits when `j` is no longer in the range `-c` to `-1`.
   - If `c` is -1, the loop will run only once (for `j = -1`).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `c` is not specified, we cannot definitively say how many iterations remain, but we know that the loop can potentially run another `-c` times.
   - We need to consider the state just before the next iteration starts.

5. **Key Variables**:
   - `new_nodes`: Remains empty since no new nodes are added.
   - `nodes[p + 1]`: Remains unchanged since no new nodes are added.
   - `index`: Remains the same as the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited.
   - `parent_index`: Remains unchanged.
   - `count`: Remains \( n - k \).
   - `i`: Remains \( n \).
   - `p`: Remains `nodes[index] * 2`.
   - `abort`: Remains `True`.
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]`: Remains unchanged since no new nodes are added.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be in the range `-c` to `-1`. Therefore, the state needs to adjust `j` to `-c - 1`.

State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \( n - k \), `i` is \( n \), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1 for the value of `j` that was added to `new_nodes` within the loop, `j` is `-c - 1`.**
