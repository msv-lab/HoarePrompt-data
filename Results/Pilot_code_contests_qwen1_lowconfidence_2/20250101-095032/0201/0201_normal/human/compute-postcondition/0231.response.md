The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block, but in this case, there is no loop or conditional block that would be affected by the `break` statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the new value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1**
