The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. The value of `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, which is less than `4 * n`. The operation does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length 2 * (n + 1) with nodes[v * 2] set to n, `stack` contains `v` appended, `stack_pop` is the pop method of stack, `stack_append` is the append method of stack, `index` is n, `parent_index` is nodes[n * 2], `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, and `storage[t + 1]` must be less than 4 * n.**
