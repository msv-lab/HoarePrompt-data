`stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `v`, or `nodes[v * 2]`. The only change is that `v` is added to the stack.

Output State: **`t` is now the value found in `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `nodes[v * 2]` is still `index`; `v` is added to the stack**
