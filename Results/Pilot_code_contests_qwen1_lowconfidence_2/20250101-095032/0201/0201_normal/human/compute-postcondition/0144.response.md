Postcondition: ***`stack` is empty, `t` is -1, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with each `nodes[v * 2]` set to the index of its parent in the tree structure, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value of `nodes[n * 2]` and is less than or equal to 0, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `n * 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is `-1` or not, and `flag` is the value of `nodes[(nodes[n * 2] * 2) + 1]`. If `flag` equals `-1`, `abort` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `abort` remains unchanged.***
