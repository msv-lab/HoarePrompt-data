The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `edges` and `sys.checkinterval` remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, we will keep them as they are read from input. 

Output State: **`edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a road; `sys.checkinterval` is set to 2147483647; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`**
