According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `flag` is -1
- `abort` is True
- `new_nodes` contains at least one element
- `p` is the first element in `new_nodes`
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` needs to be set to the next element in `new_nodes`. Since `new_nodes` contains at least one element, and assuming the loop is about to iterate over the next element, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

Here are the key points:
- `flag` remains -1 as it is not modified within the loop body.
- `abort` remains True unless the loop body changes it.
- `new_nodes` still contains at least one element.
- `p` is now set to the next element in `new_nodes`.
- `index` will be updated to the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` is detected.
- `nodes[p + 1]` will be -1 as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `p` is the second element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
