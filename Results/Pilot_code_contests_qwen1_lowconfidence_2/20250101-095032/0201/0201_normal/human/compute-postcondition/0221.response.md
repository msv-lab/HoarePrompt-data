Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `flag` is -1, then `abort` is set to `True`.***

In this case, since the else part does not change the state further and the only condition provided is `flag == -1`, the overall postcondition simply states that `abort` is set to `True` when `flag` is -1.
