The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to `index`. Based on the initial state, `nodes[v * 2]` was previously `index`, so this assignment will not change its value. The values of `t`, `v`, and `parent_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is now the value found in `storage[t]`, `v` is now `storage[t + 1]`, and `nodes[v * 2]` is still `index`.**
