`stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the stack. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `v`, or `nodes[v * 2]`. However, the value of `v` is now added to the stack.

Output State: **`t` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `nodes[v * 2]` is assigned the value of `index`; `v` is added to the stack**
