Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[v]`
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
   - `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined
   - `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`
   - `edges` is a non-empty list
   - `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`
   - `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`

2. **Loop Condition and Loop Body:**
   - The loop iterates over each `(u, v)` pair in the `edges` list.
   - Inside the loop, the values of `u` and `v` are used to perform some operations (which are omitted).

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the next `(u, v)` pair from the `edges` list needs to be processed.
   - Since `edges` is a non-empty list, there is at least one more pair to process.
   - After processing the current pair `(u, v)`, the loop increments `storage_index` by 2 (as per the given code).

4. **New Values After the Current Iteration:**
   - `storage[storage_index]` will now hold the value of `lookup[v]` from the previous iteration.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` will now hold the value of `u` from the previous iteration.
   - `storage[storage_index + 2]` will be undefined because we haven't updated it yet.
   - `storage_index` will be `storage_index + 2` (updated from the previous iteration).
   - `lookup[u]` remains `storage_index - 2` from the previous iteration.
   - `lookup[v]` remains `storage_index` from the previous iteration.

5. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - `storage[storage_index]` will now be `lookup[v]` from the previous iteration.
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` will now be `u` from the previous iteration.
   - `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined.
   - `storage_index` will be `storage_index + 2`.
   - `lookup[u]` will still be `storage_index - 2` from the previous iteration.
   - `lookup[v]` will still be `storage_index` from the previous iteration.
   - `edges` will still be a non-empty list, as there are at least two elements left to process.

Based on this analysis, the new states for the next iteration are:

State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[v]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
