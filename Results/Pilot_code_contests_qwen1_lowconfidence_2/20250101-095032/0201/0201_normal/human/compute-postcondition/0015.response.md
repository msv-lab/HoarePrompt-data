The code `lookup[u] = storage_index` updates the value of `lookup[u]` to be `storage_index`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`
- `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`
- `edges` is a non-empty list
- `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`
- `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`

After executing the line `lookup[u] = storage_index`:
- `lookup[u]` changes from `storage_index - 2` to `storage_index`
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**.
