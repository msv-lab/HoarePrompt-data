Output State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`. For each iteration, it sets `nodes[p + 1]` to `-1`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues to execute as long as `new_nodes` contains elements. Once `new_nodes` becomes empty, the loop stops.
3. **Final State**: After the loop completes, `new_nodes` will be an empty list since the loop processes each element until `new_nodes` is exhausted.
4. **Variable Values**:
   - `flag` remains `-1` as the loop does not change its value.
   - `abort` remains `True` as the loop does not change its value.
   - `p` will be the last value of `p` that was in `new_nodes` before the loop started, since the loop processes each element sequentially.
   - `index` retains its original value, which is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in the original `new_nodes` list will be set to `-1`.

By following this logic, we can conclude that after the loop has finished executing, `new_nodes` will be an empty list, and `nodes[p + 1]` will be `-1` for each `p` that was originally in `new_nodes`.
