The code assigns the value of `i * 2` to `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `p` is updated to `(n - 2) * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` remains unchanged (non-empty), `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged (0), `i` is now `n - 2`, `abort` remains `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit; `p` is `(n - 2) * 2`.**
