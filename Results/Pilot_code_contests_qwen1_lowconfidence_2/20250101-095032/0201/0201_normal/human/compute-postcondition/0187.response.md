Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `new_nodes` is an empty list.
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited.
- `parent_index` is an integer.
- `count` is \(n - k\).
- `i` is \(n\).
- `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `c` is less than 0.

### Loop:
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for j in xrange(-c)` implies that the loop will run for `-c` iterations. Since `c` is less than 0, `-c` will be a positive number. Therefore, the loop will run for a positive number of iterations.

2. **Determining Necessary Adjustments**:
   - **`c` is less than 0**: This condition is already satisfied.
   - **`i` is \(n\)**: The value of `i` is \(n\). This might need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can start. Typically, the initial value of the loop variable (in this case, `j`) should be within the range specified by `xrange`.

Given that `j` starts from \(-c\) and runs until it reaches 0, the initial value of `j` must be a negative number. However, since `i` is \(n\), we need to ensure that the loop can still initialize and start correctly.

3. **Initial Value of `j`**:
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be a negative number. Since `c` is less than 0, \(-c\) is a positive number, and `j` will start from a negative value and increment towards 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set appropriately to allow the loop to initialize. Since `i` is \(n\) and the loop runs for `-c` iterations (a positive number of iterations), we can keep `i` as \(n\) because the loop will still run correctly regardless of the initial value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can initialize and run correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that `j` (the loop variable) starts from a negative number, which it will due to the given condition `c < 0`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, nodes[p + 1] is -1 for all indices where p was in new_nodes during the loop execution, index is the value of nodes[index] when the loop exited, parent_index is an integer, count is \(n - k\), i is \(n\), p is nodes[index] * 2, abort is True, c is less than 0, and j (the loop variable) starts from a negative number**. 

However, for simplicity and clarity in the context of the given problem, we can focus on the key states:

State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where p was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `c` is less than 0**.
