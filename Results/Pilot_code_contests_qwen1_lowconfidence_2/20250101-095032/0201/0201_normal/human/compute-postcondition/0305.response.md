`flag` is assigned the value of `nodes[p + 1]`. The previous value of `flag` was -1, but now it is updated to `nodes[p + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains [p], and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains [p], and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`**
