Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `j` is `-c - 1`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `new_nodes` is an empty list.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution.
   - `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited.
   - `parent_index` is an integer.
   - `count` is \(n - k\).
   - `i` is \(n\).
   - `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `c` is less than 0.

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for j in xrange(-c):
       nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1
   ```

3. **Observation from Example Output States:**
   - The loop iterates over `xrange(-c)`. Since `c` is less than 0, `xrange(-c)` will iterate from `0` to `-c - 1` (inclusive).
   - During each iteration, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is set to -1.
   - The variable `new_nodes` remains an empty list throughout the loop because the problem statement specifies that `new_nodes` is an empty list and does not change during the loop execution.

4. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - The loop will execute from `0` to `-c - 1`, setting `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to -1 for each `j` in this range.
   - Since `new_nodes` is always an empty list, no elements are ever added to `new_nodes` during the loop, and thus no `nodes` values are modified.
   - The values of `index`, `parent_index`, `count`, `i`, `p`, and `abort` do not change within the loop and retain their initial values.
   - The final value of `j` will be `-c - 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `new_nodes` remains an empty list.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution (which is always false since `new_nodes` is empty).
   - `index`, `parent_index`, `count`, `i`, `p`, and `abort` retain their initial values.
   - `j` will be `-c - 1` after the loop completes.

Thus, the output state after the loop finishes executing is as stated above.
