Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `storage[storage_index]` is `storage[storage_index + 1]`
   - `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`
   - `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined
   - `storage_index` is `storage_index + 8`
   - `lookup[u]` is updated to `storage_index`
   - `lookup[v]` is updated to the next `v` value

2. The code snippet is:
   ```
   storage[storage_index + 1] = u
   ```

3. This line updates `storage[storage_index + 1]` to be `u`. According to the initial state, `storage[storage_index + 1]` was previously `v`. Therefore, now `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`.

4. After updating `storage[storage_index + 1]`, the values of other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `storage[storage_index]` is `storage[storage_index + 1]` (which is now `u`)
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
- `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `storage_index + 8`
- `lookup[u]` is updated to `storage_index`
- `lookup[v]` is updated to the next `v` value

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 8`, `lookup[u]` is updated to `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is updated to the next `v` value**
