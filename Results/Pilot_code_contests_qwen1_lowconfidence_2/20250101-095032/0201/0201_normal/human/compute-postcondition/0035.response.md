According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stack`. If `stack` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `stack` is `[n]`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `stack` needs to be non-empty. Given that `stack` is initially set to `[n]`, it is already non-empty, and no adjustments are needed.

State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n where each pair of elements corresponds to a district and its connection, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element points to the corresponding position in `storage`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros, `stack` is `[n]`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`**
