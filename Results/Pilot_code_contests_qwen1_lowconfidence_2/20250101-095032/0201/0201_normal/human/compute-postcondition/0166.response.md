According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one element left in `new_nodes`. Since `p` is iterating over `new_nodes`, at the start of the next iteration, `p` will take the next element from `new_nodes`, meaning `new_nodes` should still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `new_nodes` contains at least one element, and `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
