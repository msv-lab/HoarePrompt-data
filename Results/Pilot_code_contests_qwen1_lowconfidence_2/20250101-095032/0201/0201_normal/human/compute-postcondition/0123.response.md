`flag` is assigned the value of `nodes[p + 1]`. The value of `nodes[p + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unchanged except for the assignment to `flag`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`stack` is empty, `t` is -1, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with each `nodes[v * 2]` set to the index of its parent in the tree structure, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is an integer, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is \(n * 2\), `new_nodes` is an empty list, `abort` is `False`, `flag` is equal to `nodes[p + 1]`.**
