`p` is assigned the value of `index * 2`. Since the initial state is that `index` remains `nodes[p]` and `index <= 0` does not change these variables' states, `p` will be calculated as `nodes[p] * 2`. The states of the other variables (`flag`, `abort`, `new_nodes`) are not affected.

Output State: **`flag` is `-1`, `abort` is `True`, `new_nodes` contains `[p]`, and `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`.**
