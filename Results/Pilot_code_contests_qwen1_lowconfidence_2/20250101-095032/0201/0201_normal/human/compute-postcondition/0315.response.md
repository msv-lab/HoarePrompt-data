The code updates the value of `p` to `index * 2`. From the initial state, we know that `index` is `nodes[p]`. So, `p` is now updated to `nodes[p] * 2 * 2`, which simplifies to `nodes[p] * 4`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `flag` is still `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is still `True`, `new_nodes` still contains `[p]`, and `index` is still `nodes[p]`.

The Output State is: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is `True`, `new_nodes` contains `[p]`, `p` is `nodes[p] * 4`, `index` is `nodes[p]`.**
