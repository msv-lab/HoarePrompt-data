Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is a list. If `abort` is `True`, then `new_nodes` is empty, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, and `abort` is `True`. There is no change in the state if there is no else part.***
