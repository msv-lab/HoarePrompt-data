Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n where each pair of elements corresponds to a district and its connection, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element points to the corresponding position in `storage`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\) initialized to \(-1\).
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
   - `k` is an integer representing the number of contestants to be removed (not used in the loop).
   - `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts.
   - `storage_index` is initialized to 0.
   - `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\) initialized to \(-1\).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each edge `(u, v)` in `edges`, the loop updates `storage` and `lookup`.
   - `storage[storage_index] = lookup[u]` and `storage[storage_index + 1] = v`.
   - `storage[storage_index + 2] = lookup[v]` and `storage[storage_index + 3] = u`.
   - `lookup[u]` is updated to `storage_index`.
   - `lookup[v]` is updated to `storage_index + 2`.
   - `storage_index` is incremented by 2.

3. **After the Loop:**
   - Since the loop iterates over all edges in `edges`, it will update `storage` and `lookup` for each district and its connections.
   - After executing the loop, `storage` will contain pairs of values for each district and its connections.
   - `storage_index` will be \(4 \times n\) because there are \(4 \times n\) positions to fill in `storage`.
   - `lookup` will point to the correct positions in `storage` for each district.
   - `edges` remains unchanged as it is only used to iterate and not modified within the loop.

Thus, after the loop completes, the values of the variables are as described in the final output state.
