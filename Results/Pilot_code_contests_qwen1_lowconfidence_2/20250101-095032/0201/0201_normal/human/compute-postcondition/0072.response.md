The code `nodes[v * 2] = index` updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to be `index`. Based on the initial state, `v` is the value at index \(t + 1\) in the `storage` list, and \(t\) is the value at index \(t\) in the `storage` list. However, the actual value of `v` and `t` is not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values. The value of `nodes[v * 2]` is updated to `index`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with `nodes[v * 2]` updated to `index`, `stack` now contains one less element than before, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `v` is the value at index \(t + 1\) in the `storage` list, and \(t\) is the value at index \(t\) in the `storage` list. If \(v\) equals `parent_index`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
