The code initializes `nodes` as a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, filled with zeros. This affects only the `nodes` variable. The `storage`, `storage_index`, `lookup`, and `edges` variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n where each pair of elements corresponds to a district and its connection, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element points to the corresponding position in `storage`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros.**
