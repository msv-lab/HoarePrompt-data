The code assigns the value 1 to `nodes[p + 1]`. The initial state indicates that `new_nodes` is not an empty list and `nodes[1]` is 1. The value of `p` is not specified, but it does not affect the output state since `nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value 1. Therefore, the value of `nodes[1]` remains unchanged, and the new value of `nodes[p + 1]` is 1.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is not an empty list, `nodes[1]` is 1, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1**
