`t` is assigned the value of `storage[lookup[index]]` and must be greater than or equal to 0. The code `v = storage[t + 1]` assigns the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list to the variable `v`. Since `t` is already defined and its value is `storage[lookup[index]]`, the value of `v` will be `storage[t + 1]`, which is `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is `storage[lookup[index]]` and must be greater than or equal to 0; `v` is `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`**
