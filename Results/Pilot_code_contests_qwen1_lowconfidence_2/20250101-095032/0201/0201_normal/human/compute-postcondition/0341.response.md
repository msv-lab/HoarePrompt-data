To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `flag` is -1.
   - `abort` is True.
   - `new_nodes` is an empty list.
   - `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited.
   - `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list.
   - `c` is less than 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs as long as `j < -c`.

3. **Key Variables and Their Impact**:
   - `c`: Since `c` is less than 0, `-c` is positive. For the loop to execute, `j` (which starts from 0) should be less than this positive value `-c`.
   - `abort`: This variable is currently True, but since the loop starts after exiting the previous loop, it is not directly affecting the current loop's execution condition.

4. **Initialization and Execution**:
   - The loop will start with `j = 0` and increment `j` until `j >= -c` (which is a positive number).
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `j` can indeed become less than `-c`.

Given the above analysis, the critical state to adjust is `c`, ensuring that `-c` is a positive value large enough for the loop to run multiple times. Since `c` is already less than 0, `-c` will always be positive.

Therefore, no additional state adjustments beyond ensuring the loop condition (`-c > 0`) are needed.

State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, and `-c` must be a positive integer.**

However, since the problem specifies the exact condition for the loop to execute, and `c` being less than 0 ensures `-c` is positive, we can simplify the answer:

State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, and `-c` must be a positive integer.**
