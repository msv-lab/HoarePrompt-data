The code `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to a stack. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `v`, `nodes`, or `index`. The stack itself is not a global variable in the given initial state, so its effect is localized to the scope where the stack is defined. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is now `storage[t]` and `v` is still `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`; `nodes[v * 2]` is now `index`; a value `v` is appended to the stack**
