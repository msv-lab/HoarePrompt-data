The code `storage[storage_index + 1] = v` assigns the value of `v` to `storage[storage_index + 1]`. Based on the initial state, `storage[storage_index + 1]` was previously `u`. Now, it is updated to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
