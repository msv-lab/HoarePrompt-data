Postcondition: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is either a list where each element's corresponding node in `nodes` has its index+1 set to 1, or an empty list. `p` is the last value of `p` processed in the loop, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1 for all elements in `new_nodes` if the if condition is true, or -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list if the else condition is true. `c` is less than 0, and `-c` is the final value of `-c` after the loop has executed.**
