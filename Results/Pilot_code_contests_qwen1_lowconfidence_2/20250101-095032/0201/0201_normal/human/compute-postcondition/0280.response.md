The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly shown, it implies that the `break` statement is being executed within a loop or conditional context that is not provided in the snippet. Regardless, the `break` statement does not modify any variables; it only exits the control structure.

Given the initial state and the presence of the `break` statement, the variables remain in their initial states. 

Output State: **`new_nodes` remains non-empty, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is -1, and `p` is `(n - 2) * 2`.**
