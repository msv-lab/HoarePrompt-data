Postcondition: ***`nodes[p + 1]` is 1 for all `p` in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and \(c \geq 0\).***

This postcondition includes all the variables and their values as described in the precondition, while also incorporating the condition of the if statement, which is `count == 0`.
