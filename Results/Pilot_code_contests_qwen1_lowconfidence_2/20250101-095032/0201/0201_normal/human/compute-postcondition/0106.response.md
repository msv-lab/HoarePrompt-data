The code snippet `nodes[v * 2] = index` updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to `index`. According to the initial state, `v` is `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`. This means that `nodes[v * 2]` will now be set to `index`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged because the code only modifies `nodes[v * 2]` and does not affect `t`, `storage`, `v`, `lookup`, or `parent_index`.

Output State: **`t` is now `storage[t]` and `v` is still `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`; `nodes[v * 2]` is now `index`**
