`new_nodes[j]` is a value from `new_nodes`. Given that `j` is `-c - 1`, `new_nodes[j]` refers to an index in `new_nodes`. The value at this index is added by 1, and then -1 is assigned to that position in the `nodes` list. 

Since `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` was initially -1, and `new_nodes[-c]` is the last element of `new_nodes`, this part of the initial state remains unchanged.

- `new_nodes` remains non-empty.
- `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` is still -1 because it was not modified by the current line of code.
- `j` is updated to `-c - 1`, but since the assignment operation does not affect `j`, `j` retains its original value.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` is -1, `j` is -c - 1**
