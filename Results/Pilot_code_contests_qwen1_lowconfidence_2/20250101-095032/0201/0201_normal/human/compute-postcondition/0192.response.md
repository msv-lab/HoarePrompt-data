The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element in the `nodes` list at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1`. We need to determine the value of `new_nodes[j]` first.

From the initial state, `new_nodes` is an empty list, which means `new_nodes[j]` is undefined. However, since the initial state does not specify any value for `j`, and considering that `new_nodes` is initially empty, `new_nodes[j]` would not exist for any `j`.

Given this, the line `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` cannot be executed because `new_nodes[j]` does not exist. Therefore, no changes are made to any variable, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \( n - k \), `i` is \( n \), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `j` is `-c - 1`.**
