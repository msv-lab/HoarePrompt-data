`storage_index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `storage_index` was `storage_index`, so after incrementing, `storage_index` becomes `storage_index + 2`. The values of `storage[storage_index + 1]` and `storage[storage_index + 2]` are not defined in the initial state, so they remain undefined. The states of other variables (`storage`, `edges`, `lookup`) are not affected.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[v]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 2`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
