Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State
- `new_nodes` is non-empty.
- For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.
- `index` is the final value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited.
- `parent_index` is an integer.
- `count` is \(n - k\).
- `i` is \(n - 1\).
- `p` is the final value calculated as `index * 2`.
- `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0.
- `j` is \(-c - 1\).
- `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.
- `c` is less than 0.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `for j in xrange(-c)`.

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range defined by `xrange(-c)`.
   - The range `xrange(-c)` will include all integers from 0 up to `-c - 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**:
   - It is given that `j` is \(-c - 1\).
   - Since `c` is less than 0, \(-c\) will be a positive number, and \(-c - 1\) will be a negative number.

3. **Condition for Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` (which is \(-c - 1\)) must be within the range `xrange(-c)`.
   - This means \(-c - 1\) must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than \(-c\).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that \(-c - 1\) is within the valid range of `xrange(-c)`.
   - Specifically, \(-c - 1\) should be a valid starting point for the loop, meaning it should be within the bounds of the range `xrange(-c)`.

Given that \(-c - 1\) is a specific value derived from `c`, and we know \(c < 0\), the only adjustment needed is to ensure the initial value of `j` fits within the specified range.

### Final State Adjustment
- The initial value of `j` must be \(-c - 1\) such that it is within the range `xrange(-c)`.

### Conclusion
State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the final value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the final value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0, `j` is \(-c - 1\) where \(-c - 1\) is within the range `xrange(-c)`, and `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit; `c` is less than 0.**

In simpler terms:
State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `j` is \(-c - 1\) where \(-c - 1\) is within the range `xrange(-c)`**.
