`lookup[u]` is assigned the value of `storage_index`. Based on the initial state, `storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[u]`, which means `lookup[u]` is currently `storage[storage_index]`. Now, `lookup[u]` is updated to be `storage_index`. The value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, and the value of `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined. The value of `storage_index` is updated to be `storage_index + 6`. The updates to `lookup[v]` and the fact that `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined remain unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[u]` (which is now `storage_index`), `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 6`, `lookup[u]` is updated to `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is updated based on the next `v` value**
