The code sets `nodes[p + 1]` to `-1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `flag` is `-1`
- `abort` is `True`
- `new_nodes` contains at least one element
- `p` is the first element in `new_nodes`
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected
- `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`

The only change is that `nodes[p + 1]` is now explicitly set to `-1`, which was already its initial value. Therefore, no new information is gained about the variables.

Output State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `p` is the first element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
