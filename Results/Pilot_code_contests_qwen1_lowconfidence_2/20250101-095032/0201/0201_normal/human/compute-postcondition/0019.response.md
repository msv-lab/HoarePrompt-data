The code updates the value of `lookup[v]` to `storage_index`. According to the initial state, `lookup[v]` was already equal to `storage_index`. Therefore, this assignment does not change the value of `lookup[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
