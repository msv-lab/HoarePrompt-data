Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `p` in `new_nodes`.
   - For the loop to execute, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element.

2. **Current States:**
   - `new_nodes` contains all the `p` values visited during the loop until `index` became less than or equal to 0.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.
   - `index` is the final value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited.
   - `parent_index` is an integer.
   - `count` is \(n - k\).
   - `i` is \(n - 1\).
   - `p` is the final value calculated as `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0.
   - `j` is \(-c - 1\).
   - `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.

3. **Adjusting States for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will only execute if `new_nodes` is non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `new_nodes` is not empty.
   - We don't need to adjust the other states since they are either derived from the loop or are not directly related to the loop execution.

4. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - Ensure `new_nodes` is non-empty.

State: **`new_nodes` must not be empty**
