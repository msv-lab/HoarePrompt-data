The code assigns the value at index `t + 1` in `storage` to the variable `v`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`, and `storage[t + 1]` must be greater than or equal to 0, the value of `v` will be the same as `storage[t + 1]`, which is non-negative.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`; `storage[t + 1]` is greater than or equal to 0; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`**
