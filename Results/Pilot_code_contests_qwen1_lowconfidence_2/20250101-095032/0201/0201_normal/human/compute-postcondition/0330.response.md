The code `nodes[p + 1] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the element in the list `nodes` at the index `p + 1`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `p` or `nodes`, the only change is that the element at index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list is now `1`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **nodes[p + 1] is 1**
