Let's analyze the given state and the `while True` loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `new_nodes` is a non-empty list with an additional element `p`.
- `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1.
- `parent_index` remains unchanged.
- `count` remains 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively.
- `j` is \(-c - 1\).
- `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`.
- `flag` is 1.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` for the current `p` in `new_nodes`.
- `p` is `index * 2`.

### Analysis of the `while True` Loop:
- The loop condition is `True`, meaning the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no external conditions to break out of it.

### Determining the Adjustment Needed:
Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least one more time regardless of the current values of the variables. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any of the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed for the states to ensure the loop executes one more time because the loop will always execute due to its `while True` nature.

### Final Answer:
State: **None of the states need adjustment.**
