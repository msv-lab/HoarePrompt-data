According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is `lookup[index]`.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 0. The value of `t` is derived from `lookup[index]`, so we need to ensure that `lookup[index]` is greater than or equal to 0.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `t`.

State: **`t` is `lookup[index]` and `lookup[index]` must be greater than or equal to 0**
