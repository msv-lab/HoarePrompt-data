The code `p = index * 2` updates the value of `p` to be twice the value of `index`. Given the initial state, `index` is `nodes[p]`, which means `index` is `nodes[p]`.

So, after executing `p = index * 2`, the value of `p` will be `2 * nodes[p]`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `2 * nodes[index]`, `abort` is `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
