The code sets `abort` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `abort` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\), `abort` is `False`, and `j` is \(-c - 1\).**
