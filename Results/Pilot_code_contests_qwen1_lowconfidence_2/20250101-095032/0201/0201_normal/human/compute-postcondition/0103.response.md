`t` is assigned the value of `storage[t]`. Given the initial state where `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]` and must be greater than or equal to 0, and `v` is `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`, after executing `t = storage[t]`, the value of `t` is updated to `storage[t]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is now `storage[t]`; `v` is still `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is now `storage[t]`; `v` is still `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`**
