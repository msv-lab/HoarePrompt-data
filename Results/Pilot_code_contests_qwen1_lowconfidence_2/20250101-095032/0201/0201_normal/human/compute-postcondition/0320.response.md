To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `flag` is -1
   - `abort` is True
   - `new_nodes` contains at least one element
   - `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited
   - `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected
   - `nodes[p + 1]` is -1

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for p in new_nodes:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `new_nodes`.
   - Since `new_nodes` contains at least one element, the loop will execute at least once.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `new_nodes`.

4. **Determining the Next Value of `p`:**
   - Since `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, the next value of `p` will be the next element in `new_nodes` after the current `p`.
   - Given that `new_nodes` contains at least one element, the next value of `p` will be the first element in `new_nodes` (since the loop has already processed the previous value of `p`).

5. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `flag` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes its value.
   - `abort` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes its value.
   - `index` remains unchanged because it is determined by the value of `nodes[p]` and `p` is changing.
   - `nodes[p + 1]` will remain -1 as the loop does not change this value.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `flag` is still -1 (no change mentioned).
   - `abort` is still True (no change mentioned).
   - `new_nodes` still contains at least one element (one less than the previous number of elements since one has been processed).
   - `p` becomes the first element in `new_nodes` (the next value to process).
   - `index` remains the same because it is derived from `nodes[p]` and `p` is now the first element in `new_nodes`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `p` is the first element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1**
