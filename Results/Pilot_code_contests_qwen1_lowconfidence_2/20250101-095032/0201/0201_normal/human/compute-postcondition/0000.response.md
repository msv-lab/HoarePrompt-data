The code `sys.setcheckinterval(2147483647)` sets the check interval for garbage collection in the Python interpreter. However, this does not change the values of the variables `n`, `k`, or `edges`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^6, and `edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a road; sys.checkinterval is set to 2147483647**
