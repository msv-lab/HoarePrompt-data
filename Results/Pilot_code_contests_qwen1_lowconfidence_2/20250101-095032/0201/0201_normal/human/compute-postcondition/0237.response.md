Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` is `[p, p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.***
