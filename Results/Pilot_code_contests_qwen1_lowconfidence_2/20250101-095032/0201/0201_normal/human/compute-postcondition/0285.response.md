Postcondition: ***`new_nodes` remains non-empty, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, and `flag` is 1 if the if condition `flag == -1` is false (i.e., `flag` becomes 1) or remains -1 if the if condition is true (i.e., `flag` remains -1).***
