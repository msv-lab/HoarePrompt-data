The code `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. From the initial state, we know that `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, and `p` is `index * 2`. However, since `index` is already set to the value of `nodes[p]`, this assignment does not change the value of `index`. The value of `nodes[p]` is not explicitly given, but it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only change is that the variable `index` is now reassigned to the value of `nodes[p]`, which is the same as its previous value.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
