According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the list `new_nodes`. If there are more elements in `new_nodes` that can be iterated over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_nodes` is not an empty list, and `nodes[p + 1]` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be set to the next element in `new_nodes`.

Let's denote the current value of `p` as `p_current`. Since `new_nodes` is not empty, we can assume that `p_current` is the last value of `p` used in the previous iteration. The next value of `p` will be the next element in `new_nodes`. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`new_nodes` is not an empty list, `nodes[p_current + 1]` is 1 where `p_current` is the last value of `p` from the previous iteration.**

To be more specific, if we assume `p_current` was the last element processed in the previous iteration, then the next value of `p` will be the first element in `new_nodes` (if it hasn't been exhausted yet).

State: **`new_nodes` is not an empty list, `nodes[next_p + 1]` is 1 where `next_p` is the next element in `new_nodes` from the previous iteration.**

Given this, a concrete example assuming the last value of `p` was the first element in `new_nodes` would be:

State: **`new_nodes` is not an empty list, `nodes[1]` is 1 (assuming the first element in `new_nodes` was 0, thus `p_current + 1 = 1`).**
