The code `stack_pop = stack.pop` assigns the method `pop` of the `stack` list to the variable `stack_pop`. This means that `stack_pop` can now be used to call the `pop` method of the `stack` list.

- The `stack` list itself remains unchanged.
- The `stack_pop` variable is now assigned to the `pop` method of `stack`.

The other variables (`storage`, `storage_index`, `lookup`, `edges`, and `nodes`) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n where each pair of elements corresponds to a district and its connection, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element points to the corresponding position in `storage`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros, `stack` is `[n]`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`**.
