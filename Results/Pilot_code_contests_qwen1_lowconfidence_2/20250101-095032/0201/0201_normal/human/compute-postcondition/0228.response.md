The code `flag = nodes[p + 1]` assigns the value of `nodes[p + 1]` to `flag`. From the initial state, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1. Therefore, `flag` is set to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the new value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1**
