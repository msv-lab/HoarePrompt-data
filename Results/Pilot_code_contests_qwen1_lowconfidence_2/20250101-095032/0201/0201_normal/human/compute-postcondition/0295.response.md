The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `flag` is defined as `nodes[p + 1]` and `abort` is set to `True`. However, since there is no loop or conditional block provided in the snippet, the variables `flag` and `abort` remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not modify their values.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is `True`**
