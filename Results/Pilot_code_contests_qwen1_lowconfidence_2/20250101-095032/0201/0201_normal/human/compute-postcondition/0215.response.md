According to the code, the `while True` loop will continue executing indefinitely unless there is a condition to break out of it. Given the information provided about the current state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to identify what changes are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

Here is the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_nodes` is `[p]`
- `nodes[p + 1]` is -1
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`
- `parent_index` is an integer
- `count` is \(n - k\)
- `i` is \(n - 1\)
- `p` is `index * 2`
- `abort` is `True` because `index` is less than or equal to 0
- `j` is \(-c - 1\)
- `flag` is either -1 or 1
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will continue to execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. The only condition given that would cause the loop to exit is `abort` being `True` because `index` is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `abort` must be set to `False` or `index` must be greater than 0.

State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` must be `False`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
