`storage_index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `storage_index` was `storage_index`, so now it is `storage_index + 2`. The states of other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined (since no value was assigned to it), `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is equal to `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is equal to `v`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index - 2`**
