`t` is assigned the value of `storage[t]`. The previous value of `t` was `lookup[index]`, so now `t` will be updated to the value of `storage[lookup[index]]`. The variable `v` remains unchanged as it was defined as `storage[t + 1]` and no operations were performed on it.

Output State: **`t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`**
