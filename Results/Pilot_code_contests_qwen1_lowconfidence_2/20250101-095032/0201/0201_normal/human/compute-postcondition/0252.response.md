Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `p` in `new_nodes`.
   - The loop will execute if `new_nodes` is non-empty, which is already given as a condition.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `new_nodes` is non-empty.
   - For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1.
   - `index` is the final value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited.
   - `parent_index` is an integer.
   - `count` is \(n - k\).
   - `i` is \(n - 1\).
   - `p` is the final value calculated as `index * 2`.
   - `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0.
   - `j` is \(-c - 1\).
   - `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.
   - `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and \(c \geq 0\).

3. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each `p` in `new_nodes`, we need to ensure that the initial state is valid for the first iteration of the loop.
   - `new_nodes` must be non-empty.
   - `index` should be such that `index * 2` is a valid index in `new_nodes` for the first iteration.
   - `c` should be non-negative, which is already given.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that the first element `p` in `new_nodes` can be accessed in the loop.
   - Since `p` is the final value calculated as `index * 2`, we need to set `index` such that `index * 2` is a valid index in `new_nodes`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing with a valid `p` from `new_nodes`.

**Final Adjusted State**:
- `new_nodes` is non-empty.
- `index` is such that `index * 2` is a valid index in `new_nodes`.
- All other variables (`parent_index`, `count`, `i`, `abort`, `j`, `flag`, `c`) are as given.

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `index` is such that `index * 2` is a valid index in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit; `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)` and \(c \geq 0\)**.
