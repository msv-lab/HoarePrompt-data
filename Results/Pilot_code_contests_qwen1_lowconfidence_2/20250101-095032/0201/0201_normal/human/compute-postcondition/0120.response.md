The code `p = i * 2` assigns the value of `i * 2` to the variable `p`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `p`, but we know it is twice the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`stack` is empty, `t` is -1, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with each `nodes[v * 2]` set to the index of its parent in the tree structure, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is an integer, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is `n - k`, and `i` is `n`; `p` is `i * 2` and `new_nodes` is an empty list.**
