The code `parent_index = nodes[index * 2]` updates the value of `parent_index` to be `nodes[index * 2]`. This means that the variable `parent_index` now holds the value that was stored at the index `index * 2` in the list `nodes`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided. 

Output State: **`t` is -1, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with `nodes[index * 2]` potentially updated according to the loop logic, `stack` contains `stack` minus its last element, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value previously popped from the stack, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`.**
