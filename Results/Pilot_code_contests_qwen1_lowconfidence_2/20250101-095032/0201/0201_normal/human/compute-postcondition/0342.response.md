The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` in the list `nodes`. Since `new_nodes` is an empty list, `new_nodes[j]` would raise an `IndexError` if `j` is accessed. However, based on the given conditions and without knowing the specific value of `j`, we can infer that `j` must refer to an index within the bounds of `new_nodes`, which is currently empty. Therefore, no assignment is made, and the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is less than 0, and `-c` must be a positive integer.**
