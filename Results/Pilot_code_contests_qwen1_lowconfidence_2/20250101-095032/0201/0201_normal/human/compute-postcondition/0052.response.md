The code updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to be equal to `index`. Given the initial state, this means that `nodes[v * 2]` is now set to `n`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length 2 * (n + 1) with nodes[v * 2] set to n, `stack` contains `v`, `stack_pop` is the pop method of stack, `stack_append` is the append method of stack, `index` is n, `parent_index` is nodes[n * 2], `t` is now `storage[t]`, `v` is storage[t + 1], and `storage[t + 1]` must be less than 4 * n.**
