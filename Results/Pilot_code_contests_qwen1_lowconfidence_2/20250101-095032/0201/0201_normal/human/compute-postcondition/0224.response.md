The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
