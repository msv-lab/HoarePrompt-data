`storage_index` is incremented by 2. Initially, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`, so after the increment, `storage_index` becomes `(storage_index + 4) + 2`, which simplifies to `storage_index + 6`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 6`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
