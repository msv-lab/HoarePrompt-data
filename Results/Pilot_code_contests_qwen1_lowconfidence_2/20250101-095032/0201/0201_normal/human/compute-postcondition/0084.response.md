The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `storage`, or `v`.

The values of these variables remain as they were before the `continue` statement was executed. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is equal to `storage[storage[t + 1]]`; `storage[t + 1]` is greater than or equal to 0; `v` is equal to `storage[t + 1]`**.
