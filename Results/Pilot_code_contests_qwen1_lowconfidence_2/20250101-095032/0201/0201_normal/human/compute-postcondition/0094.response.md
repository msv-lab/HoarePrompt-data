`t` is assigned the value of `lookup[index]`, and it is given that `lookup[index]` must be greater than or equal to 0. The code sets `v` to `storage[t + 1]`. Since `t` is `lookup[index]`, `v` is now assigned the value at index `t + 1` in the `storage` list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is `lookup[index]` and `v` is `storage[t + 1]`**
