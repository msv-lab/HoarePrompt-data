Output State: **`new_nodes` must be empty, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `new_nodes` is a list that originally contained the indices of nodes that were modified during the loop, and `abort` is `True`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `new_nodes` and sets `nodes[p + 1]` to -1 for each `p` in `new_nodes`.
2. **Final State of `new_nodes`**: After all iterations, `new_nodes` must be empty because each element `p` in `new_nodes` is processed exactly once.
3. **Modification of `nodes`**: For each `p` that was in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` will be -1.
4. **Other Variables**:
   - `index`: This remains the value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exits.
   - `parent_index`, `count`, `i`, and `p` retain their final values after the loop completes.
   - `abort` remains `True` since the loop breaks when `flag` is `-1`.

Thus, the loop modifies the `nodes` list and ensures `new_nodes` becomes empty after processing all its elements.
