The code `index = stack_pop()` assigns the value popped from the stack to the variable `index`. This affects the `stack` variable by reducing its size by one, and updates the `index` variable with the value that was popped.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with nodes[v * 2] set to the last value of `index` for each v encountered, `stack` now contains one less element than before, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value popped from the stack, `parent_index` is nodes[n * 2], `t` is a negative value**
