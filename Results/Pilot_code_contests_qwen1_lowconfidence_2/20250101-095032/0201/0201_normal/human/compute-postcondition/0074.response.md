To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The loop condition is `while t >= 0:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0 at the start of the next iteration. 

Given the information at the end of the previous iteration:
- `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\)
- `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\)
- `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\)
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts
- `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with `nodes[v * 2]` updated to `index`
- `stack` now contains one more element than before
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is the value previously popped from the stack
- `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`
- `v` is the value at index \(t + 1\) in the `storage` list
- \(t\) is the value at index \(t\) in the `storage` list

The key variable here is `t`, which is checked against 0 in the loop condition. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since the loop's continuation depends solely on the value of `t`.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0**
