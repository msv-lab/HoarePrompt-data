The code `break` is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates the end of the current block of code. All the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`new_nodes` remains non-empty, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is `False`, `j` is `-c - 1`, `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is 1, and `p` is `(n - 2) * 2.**
