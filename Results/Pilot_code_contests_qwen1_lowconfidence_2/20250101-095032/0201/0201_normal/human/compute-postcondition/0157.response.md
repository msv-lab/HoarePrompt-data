The code `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. Given that `p` is defined as `nodes[p] * 2`, the new value of `new_nodes` will include this updated value.

- The original `new_nodes` list contains `n * 2` followed by `nodes[n * 2] * 2`.
- After appending `p`, which is `nodes[p] * 2`, the new list will be: `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, nodes[p] * 2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`stack` is empty, `t` is -1, `storage` is a list of length \(4 \times n\), `storage_index` is \(4 \times n\), `lookup` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length \(2 \times (n + 1)\) with each `nodes[v * 2]` set to the index of its parent in the tree structure, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2, nodes[p] * 2]`, and `abort` is `True` if `flag` is `-1`, otherwise `abort` is `False` and the most internal loop or conditional block is broken out of. `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`.**
