The code `continue` causes the loop to continue to the next iteration without executing any further statements in the current iteration. Since no variables are modified within the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the final value of `nodes[p]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is the final value calculated as `index * 2`, `abort` is `True` because `index` became less than or equal to 0, `j` is \(-c - 1\), and `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition that caused the loop to exit.**
