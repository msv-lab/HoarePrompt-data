`new_nodes` appends the value of `p` to itself. Since `new_nodes` initially is `[p]`, after appending `p`, `new_nodes` becomes `[p, p]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p, p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` must be `True`, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
