The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value of `nodes` at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`. However, since the initial state does not specify any values for `new_nodes`, we cannot determine the exact value of `new_nodes[j]` without additional information. But we know that `nodes[p + 1]` is set to `-1` for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution. This means that the current operation will set `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to `-1`.

Given that `new_nodes` is initially an empty list and no elements have been added to it yet, we can infer that `new_nodes[j]` is undefined or does not exist in this context. However, for the sake of the exercise, let's assume that the loop has already run and added elements to `new_nodes`, and `j` is a valid index.

Since the initial state specifies that `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1` for all indices where `p` was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, and the current line of code follows this logic, the value of `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` will be `-1`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is an empty list, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for all indices where p was in `new_nodes` during the loop execution, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n\), `p` is `nodes[index] * 2`, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1.**
