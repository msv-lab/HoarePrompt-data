`new_nodes[j] + 1` is assigned the value `-1`. The value of `new_nodes[j]` is a specific index from the non-empty list `new_nodes`. Since `j` is within the range `xrange(-c)`, the value of `new_nodes[j]` is an integer between `0` and `-c-1` (inclusive).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `new_nodes` remains non-empty, but the value of `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is now `-1`.
- The value of `j` remains \(-c - 1\).
- The value of `c` is unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1, `j` is \(-c - 1\)**
