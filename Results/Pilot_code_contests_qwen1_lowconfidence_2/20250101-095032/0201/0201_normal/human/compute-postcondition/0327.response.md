The code assigns the value of `count - len(new_nodes)` to the variable `c`. Given the initial state, the variable `count` and the length of `new_nodes` are not specified, but we know that `new_nodes` is an empty list. Therefore, `len(new_nodes)` is 0. So, the value of `c` is `count - 0`, which simplifies to just `count`.

The states of the other variables (`flag`, `abort`, `new_nodes`, `p`, `index`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `p` is the last value of `p` before the loop exited, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` when `flag == -1` was detected, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1 for every `p` in the original `new_nodes` list, `c` is `count`**
