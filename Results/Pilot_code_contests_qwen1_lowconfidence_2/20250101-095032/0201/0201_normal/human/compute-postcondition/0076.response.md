`t` is assigned the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`. The initial value of `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`. After executing the code, the value of `v` remains unchanged because the assignment to `t` does not affect `v`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is now equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`.

Output State: **`t` is now equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`**
