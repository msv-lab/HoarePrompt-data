`storage[storage_index]` is assigned the value of `lookup[u]`. Given the initial state, the value of `storage[storage_index]` was `storage_index`. Therefore, after the assignment, `storage[storage_index]` will now be equal to `lookup[u]`. The value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains unchanged as it was the next `u` value from `edges`. The value of `storage[storage_index + 2]` is still undefined. The value of `storage_index` changes to `storage_index + 6`, and `lookup[u]` and `lookup[v]` are updated based on the next `u` value.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `lookup[u]`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is the next `u` value from `edges`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 6`, `lookup[u]` is updated based on the next `u` value, `lookup[v]` is updated based on the next `v` value**
