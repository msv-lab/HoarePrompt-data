The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, the provided code snippet does not indicate which loop this statement belongs to, nor does it include a loop context. Given the initial state, no changes are made to the variables by the `continue` statement because it does not execute any new operations. 

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length 2 * (n + 1) with nodes[v * 2] set to n, `stack` contains `v` appended, `stack_pop` is the pop method of stack, `stack_append` is the append method of stack, `index` is n, `parent_index` is nodes[n * 2], `t` is `storage[t + 1]`, and `v` is now `storage[t + 1]` with `storage[t + 1]` being less than 4 * n.**
