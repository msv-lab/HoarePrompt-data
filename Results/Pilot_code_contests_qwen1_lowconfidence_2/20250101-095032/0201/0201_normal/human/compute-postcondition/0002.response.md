The code reads `n-1` pairs of integers from standard input and assigns them to the `edges` list. Each pair represents the districts connected by a road. The variable `sys.checkinterval` and the variable `n` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a road; `sys.checkinterval` is set to 2147483647; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`**
