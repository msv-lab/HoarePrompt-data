The code assigns `-1` to `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]`. Given the initial state, `new_nodes[j]` is equivalent to `new_nodes[-c]` because `j` is `-c`. Since `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is initially `-1`, assigning `-1` to it does not change its value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is non-empty, `nodes[new_nodes[-c] + 1]` is -1**
