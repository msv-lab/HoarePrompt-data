The code snippet `storage[storage_index + 1] = u` updates the value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` to `u`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `v`
- `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`
- `edges` is a non-empty list
- `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`
- `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `storage[storage_index + 1]` changes to `u`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `storage_index`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `storage[storage_index + 2]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `storage_index + 4`, `edges` is a non-empty list, `lookup[u]` is `storage_index`, `lookup[v]` is `storage_index`**
