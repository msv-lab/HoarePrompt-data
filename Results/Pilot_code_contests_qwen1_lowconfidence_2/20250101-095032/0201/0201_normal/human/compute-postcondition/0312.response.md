The code assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but it is now set to `nodes[p]`. The other variables (`flag`, `abort`, `new_nodes`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains [p], `p` is `nodes[p] * 2`, `index` is `nodes[p]`**
