The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a non-empty list with an additional element `p`, `nodes[p + 1]` for each `p` in `new_nodes` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is 1, and `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` for the current `p` in `new_nodes`, where `index` is less than or equal to 0.
