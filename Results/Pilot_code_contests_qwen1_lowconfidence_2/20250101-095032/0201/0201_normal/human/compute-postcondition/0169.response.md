The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the index `p + 1` in the `nodes` list. Since `p` is the first element of `new_nodes`, `p` has a specific value, and `nodes[p + 1]` was initially `-1`. After executing the code, `nodes[p + 1]` will be updated to `-1`, which means the value remains unchanged.

The initial state includes that `new_nodes` contains at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is `-1`, and `p` is the first element of `new_nodes`. These conditions are still valid after the code has been executed. The only change is in the value of `nodes[p + 1]`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` contains at least one element, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, and `p` is the first element of `new_nodes`**
