`nodes[p + 1]` is assigned the value 1. This overwrites the previous value of `nodes[p + 1]`, which was 1. The value of `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes`, but since the exact value of `p` is not given, we only know that `p` is updated to the next value in `new_nodes`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `p` is set to the next value in `new_nodes`**
