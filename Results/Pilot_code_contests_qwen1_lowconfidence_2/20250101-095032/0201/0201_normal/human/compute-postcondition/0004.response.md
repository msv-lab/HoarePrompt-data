The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. The function operates on data that are implied but not passed as arguments, specifically `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, and `edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a road.

Case_1: The function returns information based on the connectivity of districts represented by the `edges`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process the implied parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges` and return information based on the connectivity of districts. 

Functionality: **The function processes the implied parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges` (where `n` and `k` are integers and `edges` is a list of tuples representing district connections) and returns information based on the connectivity of districts.**
