The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, in this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables `t` and `v`. The values of `t` and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is now `storage[t]`; `v` is still `storage[storage[lookup[index]] + 1]`**
