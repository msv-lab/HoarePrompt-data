The code `p = index * 2` assigns the value of `index * 2` to `p`. Given that `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` for the current `p` in `new_nodes` and is less than or equal to 0, `p` will also be less than or equal to 0 because multiplying a non-positive number by 2 results in a non-positive number.

Let's list the changes:
- `p` is updated to `index * 2`.
- The values of the other variables remain unchanged: `new_nodes` is a non-empty list with an additional element `p`, `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is 1, and `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` for the current `p` in `new_nodes`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`new_nodes` is a non-empty list with an additional element `p`, `nodes[p + 1]` remains -1, `parent_index` remains unchanged, `count` remains 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `flag` is -1 or 1 respectively, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `c` is `count - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is 1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` for the current `p` in `new_nodes`, `p` is `index * 2`.**
