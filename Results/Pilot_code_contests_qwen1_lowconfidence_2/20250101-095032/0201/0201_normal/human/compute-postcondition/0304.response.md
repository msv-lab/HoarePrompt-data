Let's analyze the given program state and the `while True` loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- **`flag`**: `-1`
- **`abort`**: `True`
- **`new_nodes`**: Contains `[p]`
- **`p`**: `nodes[p] * 2`

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop is `while True`, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.

### Current State:
- Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least once more, regardless of the values of the variables inside the loop. 

### Required Adjustment:
- No adjustments are necessary for the `while True` loop to execute one more time because it will always iterate as long as the loop condition (`True`) is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
- There are no specific state modifications required since the loop will definitely execute another iteration due to its nature (`while True`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`flag` is -1, `abort` is True, `new_nodes` contains [p], and `p` is nodes[p] * 2**
