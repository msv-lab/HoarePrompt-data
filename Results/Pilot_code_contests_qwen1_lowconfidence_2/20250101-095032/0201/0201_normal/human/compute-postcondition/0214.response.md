The code `p = index * 2` updates the value of `p` to be twice the value of `index`. From the initial state, we know that `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, and `nodes[p + 1]` is -1. The value of `p` was originally \((n - 1) * 2\).

Given that `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, we can substitute this into the equation for `p`:

- Initial `p` value: \((n - 1) * 2\)
- New `p` value: `index * 2`

Since `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` and `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\), the new value of `p` is twice the value of `nodes[(n - 1) * 2]`.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]`, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is `index * 2`, `abort` is `True` because `index` is less than or equal to 0, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
