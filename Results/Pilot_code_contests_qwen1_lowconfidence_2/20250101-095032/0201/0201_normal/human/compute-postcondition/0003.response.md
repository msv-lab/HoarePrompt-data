The function `func_1(n, k, edges)` is called, but the implementation of this function is not provided. Without knowing what `func_1` does, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, we can state that the function may modify the values of `n`, `k`, and `edges`. The state of `sys.checkinterval` is not affected by this function call.

Given the initial state:
- `edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a road.
- `sys.checkinterval` is set to 2147483647.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^6.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`.

After calling `func_1(n, k, edges)`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `edges` may have changed, but their types and relationships remain the same. The value of `sys.checkinterval` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a road; `sys.checkinterval` is set to 2147483647; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`; the values of `n`, `k`, and `edges` may have changed due to the call to `func_1(n, k, edges)`.**
