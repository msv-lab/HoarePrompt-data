The code snippet `stack_append = stack.append` simply assigns the `append` method of the `stack` list to the variable `stack_append`. This does not change the values of the existing variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`storage` is a list of length 4 * n where each pair of elements corresponds to a district and its connection, `storage_index` is 4 * n, `lookup` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element points to the corresponding position in `storage`, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the connections between districts, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros, `stack` is `[n]`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`**
