The code snippet `new_nodes.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. From the initial state, we know that `new_nodes` is an empty list, and `p` is equal to \((n - 1) * 2\). After appending `p` to `new_nodes`, the list will contain `[p]`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is `[p]`, `nodes[p + 1]` is -1, `index` is the value of `nodes[index]` when the loop exited, `parent_index` is an integer, `count` is \(n - k\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `p` is \((n - 1) * 2\), `abort` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition of the if statement, `j` is \(-c - 1\), `flag` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
