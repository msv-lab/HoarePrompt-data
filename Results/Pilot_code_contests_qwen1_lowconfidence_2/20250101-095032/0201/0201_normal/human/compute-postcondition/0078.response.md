Postcondition: ***`t` is now equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`; `v` is equal to the value at index `t + 1` in `storage`. If `v` equals `parent_index`, the function does not change the values of `t` and `v`. Since there is no else part, the values of `t` and `v` remain unchanged in this case.***
