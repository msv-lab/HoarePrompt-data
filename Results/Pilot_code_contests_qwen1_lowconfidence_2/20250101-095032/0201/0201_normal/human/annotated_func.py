#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of districts), `k` (the number of contestants to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the connections between districts). It constructs a data structure using the `storage` and `lookup` lists to represent the connections between districts. Then, it builds a tree-like structure using the `nodes` list, where each node's left child is stored in `nodes[v * 2]` and the right child in `nodes[v * 2 + 1]`. After constructing the tree, it removes `k` districts (contestants) and updates the `nodes` list accordingly. Finally, it prints the remaining districts that are not removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, and edges is a list of n-1 tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the districts connected by a road.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` reads the number of districts \( n \) and the number of queries \( k \) from standard input, followed by a list of \( n-1 \) tuples representing the roads connecting the districts. It then calls another function `func_1(n, k, edges)` with these parameters. After `func_1` executes, the function does not return any value but sets up the environment for further processing of district connectivity queries. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values outside the specified range (e.g., \( n \) or \( k \) not being positive integers, or \( k \geq n \)). If `func_1` does not handle these edge cases, they should be noted as missing functionality.
