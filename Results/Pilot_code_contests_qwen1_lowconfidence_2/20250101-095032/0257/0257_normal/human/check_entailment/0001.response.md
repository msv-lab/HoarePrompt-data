Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the transformation rules correctly as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program only considers the transformations where \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\) with \(1 < |x|\), but it fails to account for the absolute value condition \(1 < |x|\). 

For example, consider the case when \(n = 6\):
- According to the problem, valid transformations include \(2 \rightarrow -2\) and \(-2 \rightarrow 2\) with \(|x| = 2\).
- However, the program only adds points for \(|x| > 1\), which means it should correctly calculate the score for \(2 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow 2\).

The program incorrectly calculates the score as follows:
- It increments the score by \(4 \times 2\) for each cycle, but it does not correctly handle all possible transformations.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that all valid transformations are considered, including those involving the absolute value condition. Therefore, the provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
