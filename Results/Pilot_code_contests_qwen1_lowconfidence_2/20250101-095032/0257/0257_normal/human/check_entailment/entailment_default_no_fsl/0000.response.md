Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The code calculates a sum based on the input integer \( n \) by iterating from 2 to \( n \) and adding \( 4 \times cur \) to `ans` for each \( i \) until \( i \times cur \) exceeds \( n \). However, this approach does not accurately reflect the transformation rules specified in the problem description.

According to the problem description, a transformation is possible between two integers \( a \) and \( b \) if there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( 1 < |x| \) and either \( a \cdot x = b \) or \( b \cdot x = a \). The code should simulate these transformations and keep track of the maximum score achievable.

For instance, consider the following cases:

1. **Input: 4**
   - Expected Output: 8
   - The correct transformations would be \( 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow -4 \rightarrow 2 \), resulting in a score of 8.
   - The code calculates \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \), which matches the expected output. However, the code does not simulate the actual transformations and just calculates a fixed value.

2. **Input: 6**
   - Expected Output: 28
   - The correct transformations would involve a more complex series of steps, but the code calculates \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) repeatedly, resulting in \( 12 + 12 + 4 = 28 \). This is incorrect because it does not account for the full set of possible transformations.

3. **Input: 2**
   - Expected Output: 0
   - Since no transformations are possible, the code correctly outputs 0.

Given these observations, the code does not correctly implement the transformation logic and therefore is incorrect for general cases.
