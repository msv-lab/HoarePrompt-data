You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a positive integer n greater or equal to 2. For every pair of integers a and b (2 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ n), you can transform a into b if and only if there exists an integer x such that 1 < |x| and (a ⋅ x = b or b ⋅ x = a), where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.

After such a transformation, your score increases by |x| points and you are not allowed to transform a into b nor b into a anymore.

Initially, you have a score of 0. You can start at any integer and transform it as many times as you like. What is the maximum score you can achieve?

Input

A single line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the given integer described above.

Output

Print an only integer — the maximum score that can be achieved with the transformations. If it is not possible to perform even a single transformation for all possible starting integers, print 0.

Examples

Input

4


Output

8

Input

6


Output

28

Input

2


Output

0

Note

In the first example, the transformations are 2 → 4 → (-2) → (-4) → 2.

In the third example, it is impossible to perform even a single transformation.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000.
def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    out = []
    n, ans = int(input()), 0
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        cur = 2
        
        while i * cur <= n:
            ans += 4 * cur
            cur += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is `n // (n - 1) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for all valid `i` where `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, `n` must be at least 2.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates a specific sum based on the input integer \( n \). It does not accept any parameters and returns no explicit value; however, the result of the calculation is printed to the standard output. The function iterates from 2 to \( n \), and for each \( i \) in this range, it increments a counter `cur` and adds \( 4 \times cur \) to the variable `ans` until \( i \times cur \) exceeds \( n \). After completing the iteration, it prints the accumulated value of `ans`. This value depends on the initial \( n \) provided, and it sums up values of \( 4 \times cur \) for all valid \( i \) where \( 2 \leq i \leq n \). The function handles the edge case where \( n \geq 2 \); otherwise, it would not enter the loop and simply print 0, which is implied by the loop condition.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
