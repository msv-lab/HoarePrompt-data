Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` from standard input using `rint()`, which is part of the custom I/O functions defined at the beginning. This matches the requirement that the input is a single integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100,000 \).

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, representing the total score.
   - It iterates over the range from 2 to \( n \) (inclusive) using the loop `for i in range(2, n + 1):`.
   - For each \( i \) in this range, it initializes `cur` to 2 and enters a while loop `while i * cur <= n:`.
   - Inside the while loop, it increments the score by \( 4 \times cur \) and increments `cur` by 1 until \( i \times cur \) exceeds \( n \).
   - The increment of `4 * cur` is equivalent to the transformation score described in the problem statement, where \( |x| = cur \) and the score is \( |x| = cur \).

3. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the maximum score achievable based on the transformations described.

The logic in the while loop ensures that for each \( i \), all possible valid transformations are accounted for, and the score is incremented accordingly. Since the problem statement specifies that the score for transforming \( a \) into \( b \) is \( |x| \) where \( a \cdot x = b \) or \( b \cdot x = a \), and the score is \( 4 \times cur \) for each valid transformation, the program correctly implements this logic.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
