Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem, for every pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(2 \leq |a|, |b| \leq n\)), you can transform \(a\) into \(b\) if there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(1 < |x|\) and either \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\). The score increases by \(|x|\) points for each valid transformation, and you cannot transform \(a\) into \(b\) or \(b\) into \(a\) again.

However, the provided code does not actually perform any transformations. Instead, it calculates a sum based on the input \(n\). Specifically, for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), it increments a counter `cur` and adds \(4 \times cur\) to the variable `ans` until \(i \times cur > n\).

This calculation does not reflect the actual transformations or scoring rules specified in the problem. The output is a fixed mathematical computation rather than the dynamic process of transforming numbers according to the given rules.

For example, for \(n = 4\), the code calculates:
- For \(i = 2\): \(2 \times 2 = 4\), \(2 \times 3 = 6\) (exceeds 4), so add \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
- For \(i = 3\): \(3 \times 2 = 6\) (exceeds 4), so add \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Thus, the final score is \(8 + 8 = 16\), which is incorrect. The correct transformations for \(n = 4\) should be \(2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow (-2) \rightarrow (-4) \rightarrow 2\), resulting in a score of \(8\).

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
