Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the transformation rules described in the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the maximum score based on a different logic that does not accurately reflect the allowed transformations. 

The transformation rule states that you can transform \(a\) into \(b\) if there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(1 < |x|\) and either \(a \cdot x = b\) or \(b \cdot x = a\). The program's logic does not account for this rule properly. Instead, it appears to be attempting to calculate a score based on multiples of numbers up to \(n\), which is not aligned with the transformation rules.

For instance, consider the input `n = 4`. According to the problem description, valid transformations include:
- \(2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow -2 \rightarrow -4 \rightarrow 2\), yielding a score of \(8\).

However, the program's logic does not capture these transformations correctly. Therefore, the output for \(n = 4\) would not be \(8\) as expected, indicating that the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
