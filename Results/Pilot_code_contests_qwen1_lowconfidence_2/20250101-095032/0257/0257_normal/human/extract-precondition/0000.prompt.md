You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given a positive integer n greater or equal to 2. For every pair of integers a and b (2 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ n), you can transform a into b if and only if there exists an integer x such that 1 < |x| and (a ⋅ x = b or b ⋅ x = a), where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.

After such a transformation, your score increases by |x| points and you are not allowed to transform a into b nor b into a anymore.

Initially, you have a score of 0. You can start at any integer and transform it as many times as you like. What is the maximum score you can achieve?

Input

A single line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the given integer described above.

Output

Print an only integer — the maximum score that can be achieved with the transformations. If it is not possible to perform even a single transformation for all possible starting integers, print 0.

Examples

6


Output

28

Input

2


Output

0

Note

In the first example, the transformations are 2 → 4 → (-2) → (-4) → 2.

In the third example, it is impossible to perform even a single transformation.
