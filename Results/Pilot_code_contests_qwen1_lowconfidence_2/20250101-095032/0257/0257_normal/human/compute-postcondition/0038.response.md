The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so `cur` becomes 3. The value of `i` remains 4, and the expression for `ans` remains unchanged since it is not directly affected by the code. The precondition that `n` must be at least 8 is also still valid.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `ans` is 2k(k + 1) + 16, `n` must be at least 8**
