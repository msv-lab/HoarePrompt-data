The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. From the initial state, we know that `ans` is initially set to `ans + 4 * cur` and `cur` is set to `ans + 4 * cur + 1`. After executing the line `ans += 4 * cur`, the new value of `ans` will be the sum of its original value (`ans + 4 * cur`) and `4 * cur`, which simplifies to `ans + 8 * cur`.

The value of `cur` remains unchanged since the code only modifies `ans`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `ans` is now `ans + 8 * cur`
- `cur` is still `ans + 4 * cur + 1`

The precondition that `i * cur <= n` must hold for the next iteration remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + 8 * cur`, `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 1`, and `i * cur <= n` must hold for the next iteration.**
