The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. Given the initial state where `cur` is 2, the new value of `ans` will be the original value of `ans` plus `4 * 2`, which is `8`. 

So, the updated value of `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(2 - 1)(2) + 8 = 2k(k + 1) + 8 + 8 = 2k(k + 1) + 16`.

The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `cur` also remains 2.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 2, `ans` is 2k(k + 1) + 16, `n` must be at least 8**
