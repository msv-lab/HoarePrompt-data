The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans`. Since no further assignment or modification is done to `ans`, its value remains unchanged. The variables `i` and `cur` are also not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is `n // (n - 1) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for all valid `i` where `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, `n` must be at least 2.**
