The code defines a lambda function `rint` which reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type. However, no input is provided to this function in the given snippet, so the variable `rint` itself is not assigned a value. The other variables (`n`, `rstr`, `rstrs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type.**
