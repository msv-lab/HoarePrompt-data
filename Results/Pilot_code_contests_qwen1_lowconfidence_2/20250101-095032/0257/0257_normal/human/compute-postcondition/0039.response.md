Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `cur` is 3.
   - `ans` is \(2k(k + 1) + 16\).
   - `n` must be at least 8.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as \(i \times cur \leq n\).

3. **Current Values:**
   - \(i = 4\)
   - \(cur = 3\)
   - \(i \times cur = 4 \times 3 = 12\)
   - For the loop to continue, \(12 \leq n\) must hold true, which it does since \(n \geq 8\).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   To proceed to the next iteration, the product of `i` and `cur` must still satisfy the condition \(i \times cur \leq n\). Since \(i\) and `cur` are fixed at their current values, the only variable that can change is `n`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` remains 4.
   - `cur` remains 3.
   - `ans` is unchanged because the loop has not yet modified it in this context.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain such that \(12 \leq n\). Since the minimum value of `n` is 8, `n` must be at least 12 to ensure the loop executes one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be at least 12.

**State:** **`i` is 4, `cur` is 3, `ans` is 2k(k + 1) + 16, `n` must be at least 12**
