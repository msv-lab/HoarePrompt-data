Functionality: **The function calculates a specific sum based on the input integer \( n \). It does not accept any parameters and returns no explicit value; however, the result of the calculation is printed to the standard output. The function iterates from 2 to \( n \), and for each \( i \) in this range, it increments a counter `cur` and adds \( 4 \times cur \) to the variable `ans` until \( i \times cur \) exceeds \( n \). After completing the iteration, it prints the accumulated value of `ans`. This value depends on the initial \( n \) provided, and it sums up values of \( 4 \times cur \) for all valid \( i \) where \( 2 \leq i \leq n \). The function handles the edge case where \( n \geq 2 \); otherwise, it would not enter the loop and simply print 0, which is implied by the loop condition.**

This summary covers all the actions performed by the code and includes the edge case where \( n \) is less than 2.
