Output State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is `n // i + 1`, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)`, `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`**

### Explanation:
- **Variable `i`:** The initial value of `i` is 3, and it remains unchanged throughout the loop since there are no operations modifying `i` within the loop.
- **Variable `cur`:** It starts at 2 and increments by 1 each iteration until `i * cur > n`. After the loop, `cur` will be one more than the last value it held during an iteration when the condition `i * cur <= n` was true.
- **Variable `ans`:** Initially, `ans` is set to `2k(k + 1)`. Each iteration of the loop adds `4 * cur` to `ans`. After `k` iterations, `ans` will be `2k(k + 1) + 4 * (sum of all `cur` values from the start to the last valid iteration)`.
- **Condition `n`:** For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`. After the loop, `n` may have changed, but the minimum requirement for the loop to have executed at least once remains `2k(k + 1)`.

Thus, after the loop has executed all iterations, `i` remains 3, `cur` will be `n // i + 1` (since `i * cur` just exceeds `n`), `ans` will be `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)`, and `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`.
