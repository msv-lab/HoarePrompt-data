The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `cur` was previously the old value of `cur` + 1, it now becomes the new value of `cur` + 1. The states of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `cur` is the new value of `cur` + 1, `ans` is increased by `4 * cur`**
