Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state step by step:

### Given Code:
```python
while i * cur <= n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial State:
- `i` is 4
- `cur` is 2
- `ans` is \(2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)\)
- `n` must be at least \(2k(k + 1)\)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition of the Loop**:
   The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `i = 4`
   - `cur = 2`
   - Substituting these values into the loop condition:
     \[
     i \times cur = 4 \times 2 = 8
     \]
   - The loop will only execute if \(8 \leq n\).

3. **Given Constraint on `n`**:
   - It is given that `n` must be at least \(2k(k + 1)\).

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, \(n\) must be at least 8 (since \(i \times cur = 8\)).

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The initial constraint \(n \geq 2k(k + 1)\) must still hold.
   - However, since we need to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be at least 8.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 8, while still respecting the given constraint \(n \geq 2k(k + 1)\).

Thus, the adjusted state is:
- `i` is 4
- `cur` is 2
- `ans` is \(2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)\)
- `n` must be at least 8

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is 2, `ans` is \(2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)\), `n` must be at least 8**
