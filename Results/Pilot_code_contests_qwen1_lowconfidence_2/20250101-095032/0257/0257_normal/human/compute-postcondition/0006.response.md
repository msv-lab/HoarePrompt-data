The code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` which takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` lists, each containing integers read from standard input using the `rints()` function. However, since no input is provided for `n`, the function definition itself does not execute any input operations. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and stores each line as an element in a list; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers, each obtained by calling `rint()`. `rints_2d` is defined as a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` lists, each containing integers read from standard input using the `rints()` function.**
