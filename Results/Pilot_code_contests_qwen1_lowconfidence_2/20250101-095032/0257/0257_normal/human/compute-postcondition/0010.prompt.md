You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 1:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 2:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `ans` is 0; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and stores each line as an element in a list; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers, each obtained by calling `rint()`. `rints_2d` is defined as a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` lists, each containing integers read from standard input using the `rints()` function; `pr` is a lambda function that takes arguments and a separator, joins them with the separator, and writes the result to standard output followed by a newline; `out` is an empty list.
```
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
