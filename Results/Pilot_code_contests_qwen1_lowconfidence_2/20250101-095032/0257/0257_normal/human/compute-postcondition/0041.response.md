`cur` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 1`. The previous value of `ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`, and `cur` is now `ans + 4 * cur + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`, `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 1`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`, `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 1`**
