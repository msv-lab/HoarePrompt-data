`cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` and `cur` is defined in terms of each other in the initial state, but the exact values are not specified. The condition `i * cur <= n` must hold for the next iteration, which means that the value of `cur` will be used in this condition. Therefore, the updated value of `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 2`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + 8 * cur`, `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 2`, and `i * cur <= n` must hold for the next iteration.**
