According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cur`. The condition for the loop is `i * cur <= n`.

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows:
- `i` is 3
- `cur` is 3
- `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 8`
- `n` must be at least 6

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if the condition `i * cur <= n` holds true.

Given `i = 3` and `cur = 3`, we calculate:
\[ i \times cur = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

For the loop to continue, `9` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` must be at least 6, the smallest possible value for `n` is 6. However, since `9` is greater than `6`, the condition `i * cur <= n` is already not satisfied with `n = 6`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed in the states for the loop to execute one more time because the condition is already not met with the current values of `i`, `cur`, and `n`.

State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 3, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 8`, `n` must be at least 6**
