The code defines a lambda function `rint_2d` which takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers, each obtained by calling `rint()`. Since `rint()` reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type, this means that the user needs to input `n` integers to complete the lambda function call.

However, no integers have been read yet according to the initial state. Therefore, the lambda function `rint_2d` is defined but not yet called with any inputs, so the variables `n`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, and `rstr_2d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and stores each line as an element in a list; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers, each obtained by calling `rint()`.**
