The code defines a lambda function `rstr_2d` which reads `n` lines from standard input and stores each line as an element in a list. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and no values are read from standard input yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each element to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that reads `n` lines from standard input and stores each line as an element in a list. No lines have been read yet.**
