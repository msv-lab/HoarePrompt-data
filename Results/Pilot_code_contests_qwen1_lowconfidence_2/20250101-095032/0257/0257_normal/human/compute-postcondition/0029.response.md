`cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The value of `i` remains 3, and the expression for `ans` (`2k(k + 1) + 20`) does not get evaluated or altered. The precondition that `n` must be at least 6 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 4, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 20`, `n` must be at least 6**
