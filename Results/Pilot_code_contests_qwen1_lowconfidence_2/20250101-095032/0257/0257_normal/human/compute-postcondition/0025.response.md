`ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. Given that `cur` is 2, `4 * cur` equals 8. So, `ans` becomes `2k(k + 1) + 8`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 6 is also preserved.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 2, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 8`, `n` must be at least 6**
