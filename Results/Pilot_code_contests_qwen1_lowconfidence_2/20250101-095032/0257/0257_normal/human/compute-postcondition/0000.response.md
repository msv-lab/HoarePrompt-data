The provided code defines a lambda function `rstr` that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. However, no input is read in this snippet, so the value of `rstr` is a function itself, not a specific value. The initial state of `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.**
