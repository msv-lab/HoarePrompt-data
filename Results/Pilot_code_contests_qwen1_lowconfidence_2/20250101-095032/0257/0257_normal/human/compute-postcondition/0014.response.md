`cur` is incremented by 1, which changes its value. The value of `n` remains at least 4 because no operation affects it, and `ans` is updated to `ans + 4 * cur`. However, since the initial value of `cur` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific value for `ans`. The only thing we know for certain is that `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`, `cur` is increased by 1**
