To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the initialization and conditions of the loop variable `i` and the upper limit `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Range of Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` by 1 until `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `2` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Value of `n`:**
   - It is given that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`.

3. **Current State of Variables:**
   - `n` is already set to an integer within the specified range (2 to 100,000).
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - `rstr`, `rstrs`, `rint`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, and `rints_2d` are lambda functions for reading data from standard input.
   - `pr` is a lambda function for printing to standard output.
   - `out` is an empty list.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition `2 ≤ i ≤ n` requires that `2` is indeed less than or equal to `n`.

Given this analysis, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing based on the value of `n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is now 2**
