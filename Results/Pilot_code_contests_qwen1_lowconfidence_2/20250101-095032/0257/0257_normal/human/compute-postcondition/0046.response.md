Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is `n // (n - 1) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for all valid `i` where `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, `n` must be at least 2.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `n` inclusive.
   - For each `i`, `cur` starts at 2 and increments until `i * cur > n`.
   - During each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur`.

2. **Final Iteration**:
   - When `i` reaches `n`, the loop will terminate because `i * cur` will exceed `n` when `cur` becomes large enough.
   - By the time `i` reaches `n`, `cur` will be `n // (n - 1) + 1` because the loop increments `cur` until `i * cur` exceeds `n`.

3. **Value of `ans`**:
   - `ans` accumulates the value `4 * cur` for each valid `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - Since the loop runs for `n-1` times (from `i=2` to `i=n`), the final value of `ans` is the sum of `4 * cur` for all valid `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop must execute at least once, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

5. **Case Where the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and the values of `i`, `cur`, and `ans` will remain their initial values (`i` would still be 2, `cur` would be 2, and `ans` would still be 0).

Thus, the final output state is derived from the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it runs.
