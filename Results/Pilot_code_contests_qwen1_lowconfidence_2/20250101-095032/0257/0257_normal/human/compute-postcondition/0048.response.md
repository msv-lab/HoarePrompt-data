The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic since no parameters are provided. However, based on the given constraints, it seems the function might be intended to process an integer `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`. Since no specific behavior or output cases are provided, we can only describe the parameter constraint.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on internal logic. The intended parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000.**
