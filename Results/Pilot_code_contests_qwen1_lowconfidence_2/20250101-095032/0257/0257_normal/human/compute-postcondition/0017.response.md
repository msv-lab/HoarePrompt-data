The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4; `ans` is equal to the original `ans` plus 12 times `cur` plus 8; `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4; `ans` is equal to the original `ans` plus 12 times `cur` plus 8; `cur` is increased by 1**
