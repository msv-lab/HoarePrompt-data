The code `ans += 4 * cur` updates the value of `ans` by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. However, the initial value of `cur` is not specified in the initial state. Since `n` must be at least 4, this condition is preserved and unchanged by the code.

Given that the exact value of `cur` is not provided, the only information we can derive from the code is the updated value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is now `ans` plus `4 * cur`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4; `ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`**
