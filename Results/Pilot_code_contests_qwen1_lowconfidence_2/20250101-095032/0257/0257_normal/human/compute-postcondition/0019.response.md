`cur` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `cur` is the old value of `cur` plus 1. `ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. Since `n` is at least 4 and the initial state does not specify a specific value for `n`, the output state will reflect that `n` is at least 4, `cur` is the old value of `cur` + 1, and `ans` is increased by `4 * cur`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `cur` is the old value of `cur` + 1, `ans` is increased by `4 * cur`**
