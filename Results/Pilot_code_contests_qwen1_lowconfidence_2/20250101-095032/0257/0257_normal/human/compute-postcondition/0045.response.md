Output State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is `ans / 4 + 1`, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(ans / 4 + 1 - 1)(ans / 4 + 1)`, `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`**

Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 4
   - `cur` is 2
   - `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)` which simplifies to `2k(k + 1) + 4(1)(2) = 2k(k + 1) + 8`
   - `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`

2. **Loop Invariant**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i * cur <= n`.
   - Inside the loop, `ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur` each time, and `cur` is incremented by 1.

3. **Step-by-step Analysis**:
   - After 1 iteration (`cur` becomes 3):
     - `ans` becomes `2k(k + 1) + 16`
     - `i` remains 4
     - `n` must be at least 8
   - After 2 iterations (`cur` becomes 4):
     - `ans` becomes `2k(k + 1) + 20`
     - `i` remains 4
     - `n` must be at least 12
   - After 3 iterations (`cur` becomes 5):
     - `ans` becomes `2k(k + 1) + 24`
     - `i` remains 4
     - `n` must be at least 16

From these iterations, we can generalize that:
- `i` remains 4 because the loop does not affect `i`.
- `cur` increases by 1 each iteration, so after `x` iterations, `cur` is `x + 2` (since it starts from 2).
- `ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur` each time, leading to the formula `ans = 2k(k + 1) + 4(x + 1)(x + 2)` where `x` is the number of iterations.
- To find the final `cur` after all iterations, observe that `cur` is `ans / 4 + 1`.

Thus, after all iterations, the final state is:
- `i` is 4
- `cur` is `ans / 4 + 1`
- `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)` which simplifies back to the same form.
- `n` must still be at least `2k(k + 1)` to ensure the loop could run for the necessary number of iterations.
