According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i in range(2, n + 1)`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `i` is 2
- `cur` is 2 + k
- `ans` is 2k(k + 1)
- `n` must be at least 2k(k + 1)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will become 3. Additionally, `n` must still meet the condition of being at least 2k(k + 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 2 + k, `ans` is 2k(k + 1), `n` must be at least 2k(k + 1)**
