Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `cur` is `n // i + 1`
- `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)`
- `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is 3.

2. **Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `2` to `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it executes, the next value of `i` will be `4`.

4. **Check Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
   - Since we don't have the exact value of `n`, we know that `i` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

5. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `cur` is updated based on the current value of `i`: `cur = n // i + 1`.
     - For `i = 4`, `cur = n // 4 + 1`.
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)`.
   - `n` must remain at least `2k(k + 1)`.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be incremented to `4`.
- `cur` will be updated to `n // 4 + 1`.
- `ans` will be recalculated using the new value of `cur`.
- `n` must still be at least `2k(k + 1)`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 4.
- `cur` is `n // 4 + 1`.
- `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)`.
- `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 4, `cur` is `n // 4 + 1`, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 4(cur - 1)(cur)`, `n` must be at least `2k(k + 1)`**
