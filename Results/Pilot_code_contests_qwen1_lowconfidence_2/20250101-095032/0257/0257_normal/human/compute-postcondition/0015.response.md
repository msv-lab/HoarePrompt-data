Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `ans` is updated as `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`.
   - `cur` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i * cur <= n`.

3. **Current Values After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `ans` has been updated according to the formula `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`.
   - `cur` has been increased by 1 from its previous value.

4. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if the condition `i * cur <= n` holds true.
   - Since `n` is at least 4, and `cur` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i * cur` is still less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` remains at least 4.
   - `ans` and `cur` have already been updated, but for the loop to continue, `i * cur` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i * cur` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given this analysis, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that `i * cur` is less than or equal to `n`.

**Final State:**
- `n` is at least 4.
- `ans` is updated according to the formula `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`.
- `cur` is increased by 1.
- `i * cur` must be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `ans` is `ans + 4 * (cur + 1)`, `cur` is increased by 1, `i * cur` must be less than or equal to `n`**
