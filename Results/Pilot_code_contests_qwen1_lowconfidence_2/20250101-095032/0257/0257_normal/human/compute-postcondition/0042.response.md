Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`.
   - `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * cur <= n` must be true at the start of the next iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `i` and `cur` are set in such a way that this condition holds.

4. **Analyze the States**:
   - From the given states, we know that `cur` is derived from `ans` and `cur`. Specifically, `cur = ans + 4 * cur + 1`.
   - Since `cur` is calculated based on `ans`, and `ans` is also updated based on `cur`, we need to ensure that `i` and `cur` are consistent with the loop condition.

5. **Ensure the Loop Condition Holds**:
   - To satisfy the condition `i * cur <= n` for the next iteration, we need to check the current values of `i` and `cur`.
   - Given `cur = ans + 4 * cur + 1`, we need to ensure that `i * cur` is still less than or equal to `n`.

6. **Adjust States**:
   - The value of `cur` is directly dependent on `ans`, and `ans` itself is updated during each iteration.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `cur` is such that `i * cur <= n`.

Given the current state where `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 1`, and without additional information about `i` and `n`, we cannot simplify further. However, we can state that the loop will continue as long as the condition `i * cur <= n` holds true.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the condition `i * cur <= n` is met for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is `ans + 4 * cur`, `cur` is `ans + 4 * cur + 1`, and `i * cur <= n` must hold for the next iteration**
