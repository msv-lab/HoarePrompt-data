Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.
2. **Current values**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `cur` is 2.
3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Current condition: `i * cur <= n` becomes `2 * 2 <= n`, which simplifies to `4 <= n`.
4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `4 <= n` must hold true.
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 already, the only additional requirement is that `n` must be at least 4.

So, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 4.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be at least 4**
