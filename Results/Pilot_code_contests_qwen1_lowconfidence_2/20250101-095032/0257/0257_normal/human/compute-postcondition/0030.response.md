Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step.

### Given Information:
- The `while` loop condition is `i * cur <= n`.
- The current values are:
  - `i` is 3
  - `cur` is 4
  - `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 20`
  - `n` must be at least 6

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Check**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i * cur <= n`.
   - Current values are `i = 3` and `cur = 4`.
   - Therefore, `i * cur = 3 * 4 = 12`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `12 <= n` must hold true.
   - Since `n` must be at least 6, `n` should be such that `12 <= n`.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i * cur <= n` holds true for the next iteration.
   - Given `i = 3` and `cur = 4`, we need `n` to be at least 12 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - No other state (like `i` or `cur`) needs adjustment because they remain the same as in the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Specifically, `n` must be at least 12.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 4, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 20`, `n` must be at least 12**
