Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `ans` is equal to the original `ans` plus 12 times `cur` plus 8.
   - `cur` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i * cur <= n`.

3. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, the condition `i * cur <= n` must be true.
   - From the previous iteration, we know `cur` has been incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `cur` is the old value of `cur` + 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i * (cur + 1) <= n` holds true for the next iteration.
   - Since `cur` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `cur` is the old `cur` + 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, i.e., `n` is at least 4.
   - The values of `ans` and `cur` have changed, but they do not directly affect the loop condition. They just need to reflect their updated values from the previous iteration.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` must still be at least 4.
   - `cur` must be the old value of `cur` + 1.
   - There is no direct change required for `ans` as it depends on the previous computations and not the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `cur` is the old value of `cur` + 1**
