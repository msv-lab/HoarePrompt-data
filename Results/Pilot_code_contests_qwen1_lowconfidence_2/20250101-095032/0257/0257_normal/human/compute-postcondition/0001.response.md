The code defines a lambda function `rstrs` that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list. However, the lambda function itself does not execute any input reading or modify any existing variables. The initial state variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list.**
