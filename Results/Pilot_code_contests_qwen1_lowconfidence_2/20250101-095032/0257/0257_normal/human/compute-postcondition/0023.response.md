`cur` is assigned the value 2, which replaces its previous value of `2 + k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3; `cur` is 2; `ans` is 2k(k + 1); `n` must be at least 2k(k + 1).

Output State: **`i` is 3; `cur` is 2; `ans` is 2k(k + 1); `n` must be at least 2k(k + 1)**
