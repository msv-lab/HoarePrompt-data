`ans` is updated by adding `4 * cur` to its current value. Given that `cur` is 4, `4 * cur` equals 16. Therefore, `ans` becomes `2k(k + 1) + 20 + 16`, which simplifies to `2k(k + 1) + 36`. The values of `i`, `cur`, and `n` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 4, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 36`, `n` must be at least 12**
