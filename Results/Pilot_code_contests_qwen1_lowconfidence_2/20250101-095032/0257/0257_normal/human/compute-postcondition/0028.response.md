`ans` is initially given by the expression `2k(k + 1) + 8`. The value of `cur` is 3, and the code adds `4 * cur` to `ans`. Since `cur` is 3, `4 * cur` is `4 * 3`, which is 12. So, `ans` is updated by adding 12 to its initial value. The output state is: `i` is 3, `cur` is 3, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 20`, `n` must be at least 6.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `cur` is 3, `ans` is `2k(k + 1) + 20`, `n` must be at least 6**
