The code defines a new lambda function `rints` that reads multiple integers from standard input, splits the input line, and converts each element to an integer. However, no input is read in this snippet, so the values of `n`, `rstr`, `rstrs`, and `rint` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000; `rstr` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer type; `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each element to an integer.**
