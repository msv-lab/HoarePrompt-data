`Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, which means `Ans` gains the string representation of `a[i]` appended to it. The value of `a[i]` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `i + 1` must be less than `n` remains valid.

Output State: **`Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, `a[i]` retains its original value, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`.**
