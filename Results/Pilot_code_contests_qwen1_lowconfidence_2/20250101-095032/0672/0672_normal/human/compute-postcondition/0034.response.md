The code `b[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the \(i\)-th element of the list `b`. This changes the value of `b[i]` from its previous state to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is less than \(\frac{n}{2}\), `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `B` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is a list containing pairs \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) and \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) for each \(i\) in the range 0 to \(n-1\) and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of \(a_i\) and \(b_i\), `a` is a list of length \(n\) with the \((i+1)\)-th element set to 1 and all other elements set to 0, `b` is a list of length \(n\) with the \((i+1)\)-th element set to 1 and all other elements set to 0, `b[i]` is 1, and `a[i]` is 1.**
