According to the code, the loop condition is based on the variable `i`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, `a[i]` retains its original value, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State Adjustment**: Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n`.
3. **Updating States**: The value of `Ans` is updated, but we don't need to change that for the loop condition. The value of `a[i]` remains unchanged, so no adjustment is needed for `a[i]`. We only need to ensure that the new value of `i` satisfies the loop condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i + 1` must be less than `n` and `i` is the new value after incrementing.

State: **`Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, `a[i]` retains its original value, `i` is incremented by 1 and is now `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`**.
