`Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, `a[i]` retains its original value, `i` is incremented by 1, and is now `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`. The code updates `Ans` by adding the string representation of `a[i]` to it. After the operation, the value of `i` becomes `i + 1`.

Output State: **`Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, `a[i]` retains its original value, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`**
