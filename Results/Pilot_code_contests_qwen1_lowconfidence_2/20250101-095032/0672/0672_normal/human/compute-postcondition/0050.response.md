Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `B` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is a list containing pairs \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) and \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) for each \(i\) in the range 0 to \(n-1\) and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of \(a_i\) and \(b_i\), `a` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1, and `b` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1. For each pair \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) in `T`, the element at index \(n-1-i\) in `a` is set to 1 if `T[i][-1] == 0`, and for each pair \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) in `T`, the element at index \(n-1-i\) in `b` is set to 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(n-1\).
- If `T[i][-1] == 0`, the element at index \(n-1-i\) in `a` is set to 1.
- If `T[i][-1] == 1`, the element at index \(n-1-i\) in `b` is set to 1.

Since the loop runs from 0 to \(n-1\), it will eventually cover all the elements in `T`. Therefore, every element at index \(n-1-i\) in `a` will be set to 1 if there is a corresponding pair \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) in `T` with `T[i][-1] == 0`, and similarly, every element at index \(n-1-i\) in `b` will be set to 1 if there is a corresponding pair \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) in `T` with `T[i][-1] == 1`.

After the loop completes, all elements in `a` will be 1 (since every index from 0 to \(n-1\) will be checked by the loop), and all elements in `b` will be 1 (for the same reason).
