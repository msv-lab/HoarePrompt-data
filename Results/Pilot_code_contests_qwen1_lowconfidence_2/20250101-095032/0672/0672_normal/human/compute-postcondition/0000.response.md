`n` is assigned the value of an integer read from `sys.stdin`, which means `n` is now set to a specific integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` remain unchanged and are still sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` are sorted in ascending order.**
