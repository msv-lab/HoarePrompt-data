The code `A.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `A`. Initially, `A` is a list containing `[a, a]`. After appending `a`, the list `A` will now contain `[a, a, a]`.

Other variables and their lists remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` is a list containing `[a, a, a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b, b]`; `T` is a list containing `(a, n - 1, 0)`, `(b, n - 1, 1)`, `(a, n, 0)`, `(b, n, 1)`; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
