`Ans` is assigned the value `"1\n" + str(b[i+1])`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`. The value of `Ans` is then concatenated with `str(b[i])`. Since `b[i+1]` was part of the initial value of `Ans`, `b[i]` is now being appended to `Ans`.

Let's break it down:

1. Initially, `Ans = "1\n" + str(b[i+1])`.
2. After `i` is incremented by 1, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
3. `Ans` is updated to `Ans += str(b[i])`, which means `Ans` becomes `"1\n" + str(b[i+1]) + str(b[i])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `Ans` is `"1\n" + str(b[i+1]) + str(b[i])`; `i` is `i + 1`; `a` retains its original values of all ones; `n` remains unchanged; `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`Ans` is `"1\n" + str(b[i+1]) + str(b[i])`; `i` is `i + 1`; `a` retains its original values of all ones; `n` remains unchanged; `T` remains unchanged.**
