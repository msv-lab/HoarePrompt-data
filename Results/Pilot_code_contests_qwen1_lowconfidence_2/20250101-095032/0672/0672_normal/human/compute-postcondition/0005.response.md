`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input line from standard input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`. This means that `a` and `b` will be integers derived from the split input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the precondition only mentions its minimum value, not its specific value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**
