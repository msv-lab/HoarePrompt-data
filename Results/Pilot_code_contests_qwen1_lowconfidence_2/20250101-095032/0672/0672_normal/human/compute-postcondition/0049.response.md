Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `B` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is a list of pairs \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) and \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) for each \(i\) in the range 0 to \(n-1\) and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of \(a_i\) and \(b_i\), `a` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1, except for the elements at indices \(\frac{n}{2} - 2\) and \(\frac{n}{2} - 3\) which are both 1 if `T[i][-1] == 0`, and `b` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
