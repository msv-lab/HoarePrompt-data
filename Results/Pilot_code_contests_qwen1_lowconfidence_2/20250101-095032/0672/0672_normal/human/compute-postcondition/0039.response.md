Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `B` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is a list containing pairs \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) and \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) for each \(i\) in the range 0 to \(n-1\) and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of \(a_i\) and \(b_i\), `a` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1, `b` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1, and `T[i][-1]` is 1**
