The code snippet appends a new tuple `(b, i, 1)` to the list `T`. Let's break down the impact:

- Initially, `T` is a list containing the tuples `(a, n - 1, 0)`, `(b, n - 1, 1)`, `(a, n, 0)`, `(b, n, 1)`, `(a, i, 0)`.
- After executing `T.append((b, i, 1))`, the new tuple `(b, i, 1)` is added to the end of the list `T`.

Thus, the updated list `T` will contain these tuples.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` is a list containing `[a, a, a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b, b, b]`; `T` is a list containing `(a, n - 1, 0)`, `(b, n - 1, 1)`, `(a, n, 0)`, `(b, n, 1)`, `(a, i, 0)`, `(b, i, 1)`**
