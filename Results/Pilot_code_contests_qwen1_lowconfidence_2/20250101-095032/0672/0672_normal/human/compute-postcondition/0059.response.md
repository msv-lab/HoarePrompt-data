`Ans` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a`. Since `a` retains its original values of all ones, `Ans` is initially "1". The variable `i` is equal to `n`, and `T` remains unchanged. The code snippet `Ans += '\n'` appends a newline character `\n` to the string `Ans`. Therefore, the updated value of `Ans` is "1\n".

Output State: **`Ans` is "1\n", `a` retains its original values of all ones, `i` is `n`, and `T` remains unchanged.**
