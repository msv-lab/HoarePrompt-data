The code appends the value of `a` to the list `A`. Initially, `A` contains the single element `[a]`. After appending `a`, `A` will now contain two elements: `[a, a]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `b`, `T`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` is a list containing `[a, a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b]`; `T` is a list containing `(a, n - 1, 0)` and `(b, n - 1, 1)`**
