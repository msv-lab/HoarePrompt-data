Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `A` is a list containing `a1, a2, ..., an` (sorted in ascending order), `B` is a list containing `b1, b2, ..., bn` (sorted in ascending order), `T` is a list containing `(ai, n-1-i, 0)` and `(bi, n-1-i, 1)` for each `i` in the range 0 to n-1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, appending `a` and `b` values to lists `A` and `B` respectively.
- For each iteration, a tuple `(a, i, 0)` and `(b, i, 1)` is appended to list `T`.
- Since `a` and `b` are read from input in ascending order, and `A` and `B` are appended in the same order, both `A` and `B` will be sorted in ascending order after the loop completes.
- The tuples in `T` will be constructed such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the tuple for `a` will have index `n-1-i` and type `0`, and the tuple for `b` will have the same index `n-1-i` and type `1`.

This output state holds true regardless of whether the loop executes all `n` times or fewer, as long as the loop conditions are met.
