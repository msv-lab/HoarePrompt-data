Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is exactly \(\frac{n}{2}\), `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `B` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is a list containing pairs \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) and \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) for each \(i\) in the range 0 to \(n-1\) and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of \(a_i\) and \(b_i\), `a` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1, `b` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `i` in the range `0` to `n//2 - 1`. After the loop finishes, `i` will be exactly \(\frac{n}{2}\).
- For each iteration, the elements at index `i` in both `a` and `b` lists are set to 1.
- Since the loop iterates up to \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\), after all iterations, every index from `0` to \(\frac{n}{2} - 1` in both `a` and `b` lists will be set to 1.
- Therefore, after all iterations, all elements in both `a` and `b` lists will be 1.
