The code `b[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the `i`-th element of the list `b`. Since `i` is less than \(\frac{n}{2}\), the value of `b[i]` is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is less than \(\frac{n}{2}\), `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `B` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is a list containing pairs (ai, n-1-i, 0) and (bi, n-1-i, 1) for each i in the range 0 to n-1 and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of ai and bi, `a` is a list of length n with all elements set to 0 except for the `i`-th element which is 1, `b` is a list of length n with the `i`-th element set to 1 and all other elements set to 0.**
