`B` is a list containing `[b]`. The code appends `b` to the list `B`. Since `b` is already in the list, appending it again will not change its content but will ensure that `b` is present twice in the list. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` is a list containing `[a, a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b, b]`; `T` is a list containing `(a, n - 1, 0)` and `(b, n - 1, 1)`**
