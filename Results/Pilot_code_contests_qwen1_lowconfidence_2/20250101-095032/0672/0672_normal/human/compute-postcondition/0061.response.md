`Ans` is a string initially containing "1\n". The line `Ans += str(b[i])` appends the string representation of `b[i]` to `Ans`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `b` or `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `Ans` without knowing these values. But we know that `Ans` will now contain "1\n" followed by the string representation of `b[i]`.

Output State: **`Ans` is "1\n" followed by `str(b[i])`, `a` retains its original values of all ones, `i` is less than `n`, and `T` remains unchanged**
