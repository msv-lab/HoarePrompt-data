The code `T = []` initializes an empty list `T`. No changes are made to the other variables (`n`, `a1, a2, ..., an`, `b1, b2, ..., bn`, `A`, `B`). Therefore, the Output State remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` are sorted in ascending order; `A` is an empty list; `B` is an empty list; `T` is an empty list**
