The code snippet appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. Initially, `B` is a list containing `[b, b]`. After appending `b`, the list `B` will contain `[b, b, b]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` is a list containing `[a, a, a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b, b, b]`; `T` is a list containing `(a, n - 1, 0)`, `(b, n - 1, 1)`, `(a, n, 0)`, `(b, n, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` is a list containing `[a, a, a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b, b, b]`; `T` is a list containing `(a, n - 1, 0)`, `(b, n - 1, 1)`, `(a, n, 0)`, `(b, n, 1)`**
