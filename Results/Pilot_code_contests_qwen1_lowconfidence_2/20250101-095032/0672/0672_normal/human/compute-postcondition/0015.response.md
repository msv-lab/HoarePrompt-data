The code appends a new tuple `(b, i, 1)` to the list `T`. Initially, `T` contains the tuples `(a, n - 1, 0)`, `(b, n - 1, 1)`, and `(a, i, 0)`. After appending `(b, i, 1)`, `T` will now contain four tuples.

Therefore, the updated state of `T` is:

- `(a, n - 1, 0)`
- `(b, n - 1, 1)`
- `(a, i, 0)`
- `(b, i, 1)`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` is a list containing `[a, a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b, b]`; `T` is a list containing `(a, n - 1, 0)`, `(b, n - 1, 1)`, `(a, i, 0)`, `(b, i, 1)`**
