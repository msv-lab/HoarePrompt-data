Let's analyze the given loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `Ans` is `"1\n"`
- `a` retains its original values of all ones (though `a` itself is not modified within the loop, we need to note this)
- `i` is `n`
- `T` remains unchanged

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    Ans += str(b[i])
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs for `n` iterations since `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
- During each iteration, `Ans` is updated by appending `str(b[i])` to its current value.
- `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `T` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n`.

### Final Values:
- Since the loop runs `n` times, `Ans` will be a string containing `"1\n"` followed by the concatenation of all elements of `b` converted to strings.
- Specifically, `Ans` will be `"1\n"` followed by `str(b[0])`, `str(b[1])`, ..., `str(b[n-1])`.

### Output State:
- `Ans` will be `"1\n" + str(b[0]) + str(b[1]) + ... + str(b[n-1])`
- `i` will be `n` (since the loop runs until `i < n`)
- `a` retains its original values of all ones
- `T` remains unchanged

### Conclusion:
The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`Ans` is `"1\n" + str(b[0]) + str(b[1]) + ... + str(b[n-1])`, `i` is `n`, `a` retains its original values of all ones, `T` remains unchanged.**
