`B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. Since `a` and `b` are inputs, their values are not known, but the list `A` remains unchanged and only `B` is modified by appending `b`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `A` is a list containing `[a]`, `B` is a list containing `[b]`**
