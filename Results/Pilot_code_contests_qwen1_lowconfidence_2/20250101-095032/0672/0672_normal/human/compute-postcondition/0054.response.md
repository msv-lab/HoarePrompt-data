According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, and `a[i]` retains its original value. This means that `i` was incremented by 1 during the last iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 1`.

Given this, the new state will be:
- `Ans` remains the same (as it was updated based on the previous value of `a[i]`).
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, `a[i]` retains its original value, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`**.
