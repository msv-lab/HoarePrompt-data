The code `B = []` initializes an empty list named `B`. The variable `A` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` remain sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the sequences `a1, a2, ..., an` and `b1, b2, ..., bn` are sorted in ascending order; `A` is an empty list; `B` is an empty list**
