Functionality: **The function processes two sorted lists, `A` and `B`, which contain the results of participants in the first and second semifinals respectively. It constructs two new lists, `a` and `b`, both initialized to all ones. It then iterates through a sorted list `T` containing pairs of indices and flags, setting the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` to zero based on the flags. Finally, it concatenates the binary representations of the elements in `a` and `b` into strings and outputs them.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is even, both `a` and `b` will have their first half set to one and the second half set to zero.
- If `n` is odd, the middle element in both `a` and `b` will remain one.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1, though the initial check in the code (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`) ensures this is unlikely to occur in practice. However, it would be good to explicitly handle such cases, e.g., by raising an error or returning a specific message.
