`T` is appended with a tuple `(a, i, 0)`. Here, `a` is an integer from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` which is not specified in the initial state but is implied to be a variable that holds an integer value, and `0` is a constant value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `A` is a list containing `[a]`, `B` is a list containing `[b]`, `T` contains the additional element `(a, i, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `A` is a list containing `[a]`, `B` is a list containing `[b]`, `T` contains the additional element `(a, i, 0)`**
