The code `Ans += str(a[i])` updates the variable `Ans` by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to `Ans`. However, the initial values of `Ans` and `a[i]` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `Ans` is updated by adding the string version of `a[i]` to its current value.

Output State: **`Ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` to its current value, `a[i]` retains its original value**
