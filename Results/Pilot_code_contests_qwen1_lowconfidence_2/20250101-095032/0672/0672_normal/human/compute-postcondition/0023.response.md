`T.sort()` sorts the list `T` based on the first element of each tuple in `T`. Since `T` originally contains tuples of the form `(ai, n-1-i, 0)` and `(bi, n-1-i, 1)`, sorting `T` will arrange these tuples in ascending order based on the value of `ai` and `bi`.

Given that `A` and `B` are both sorted lists, sorting `T` based on the first element of each tuple will result in `T` being sorted in such a way that all tuples from `A` come before those from `B` and within each category, they are sorted according to their corresponding indices.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `A` is a list containing `a1, a2, ..., an` (sorted in ascending order), `B` is a list containing `b1, b2, ..., bn` (sorted in ascending order), `T` is a list containing `(ai, n-1-i, 0)` and `(bi, n-1-i, 1)` for each `i` in the range 0 to n-1 and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of `ai` and `bi`.**
