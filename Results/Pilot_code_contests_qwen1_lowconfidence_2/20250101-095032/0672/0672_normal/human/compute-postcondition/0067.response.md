`sys.stdout.write(Ans)` writes the value of `Ans` to the standard output. Since `Ans` is defined as `"1\n" + str(b[0]) + str(b[1]) + ... + str(b[n-1])`, it does not change the values of the variables `Ans`, `i`, `a`, or `T`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`Ans` is `"1\n" + str(b[0]) + str(b[1]) + ... + str(b[n-1])`, `i` is `n`, `a` retains its original values of all ones, `T` remains unchanged.**
