You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two semifinals have just been in the running tournament. Each semifinal had n participants. There are n participants advancing to the finals, they are chosen as follows: from each semifinal, we choose k people (0 ≤ 2k ≤ n) who showed the best result in their semifinals and all other places in the finals go to the people who haven't ranked in the top k in their semifinal but got to the n - 2k of the best among the others.

The tournament organizers hasn't yet determined the k value, so the participants want to know who else has any chance to get to the finals and who can go home.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of participants in each semifinal.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 109) — the results of the i-th participant (the number of milliseconds he needs to cover the semifinals distance) of the first and second semifinals, correspondingly. All results are distinct. Sequences a1, a2, ..., an and b1, b2, ..., bn are sorted in ascending order, i.e. in the order the participants finished in the corresponding semifinal.

Output

Print two strings consisting of n characters, each equals either "0" or "1". The first line should correspond to the participants of the first semifinal, the second line should correspond to the participants of the second semifinal. The i-th character in the j-th line should equal "1" if the i-th participant of the j-th semifinal has any chances to advance to the finals, otherwise it should equal a "0".

Examples

Input

4
9840 9920
9860 9980
9930 10020
10040 10090


Output

1110
1100


Input

4
9900 9850
9940 9930
10000 10020
10060 10110


Output

1100
1100

Note

Consider the first sample. Each semifinal has 4 participants. The results of the first semifinal are 9840, 9860, 9930, 10040. The results of the second semifinal are 9920, 9980, 10020, 10090.

  * If k = 0, the finalists are determined by the time only, so players 9840, 9860, 9920 and 9930 advance to the finals. 
  * If k = 1, the winners from both semifinals move to the finals (with results 9840 and 9920), and the other places are determined by the time (these places go to the sportsmen who run the distance in 9860 and 9930 milliseconds). 
  * If k = 2, then first and second places advance from each seminfial, these are participants with results 9840, 9860, 9920 and 9980 milliseconds. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

    for i in range(n // 2):
        a[i] = 1
        
        b[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is exactly \(\frac{n}{2}\), `A` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `B` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is a list containing pairs \((a_i, n-1-i, 0)\) and \((b_i, n-1-i, 1)\) for each \(i\) in the range 0 to \(n-1\) and is sorted in ascending order based on the values of \(a_i\) and \(b_i\), `a` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1, `b` is a list of length \(n\) with all elements set to 1.
    for i in range(n):
        if T[i][-1] == 0:

    sys.stdout.write(Ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two sorted lists, `A` and `B`, which contain the results of participants in the first and second semifinals respectively. It constructs two new lists, `a` and `b`, both initialized to all ones. It then iterates through a sorted list `T` containing pairs of indices and flags, setting the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` to zero based on the flags. Finally, it concatenates the binary representations of the elements in `a` and `b` into strings and outputs them.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
