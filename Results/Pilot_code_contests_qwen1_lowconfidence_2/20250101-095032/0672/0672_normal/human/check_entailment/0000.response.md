Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where `2k` participants advance to the finals. Specifically, the program always sets the first `n//2` positions in both lists `a` and `b` to `1`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, only `k` participants from each semifinal should be set to `1` initially, and the remaining positions should be filled based on the top `n-2k` performers from the rest of the participants.

To fix this, the program should initialize `a` and `b` such that only the top `k` participants from each semifinal are marked as `1`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    A = []
    B = []
    T = []
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        A.append(a)
        B.append(b)
        T.append((a, i, 0))
        T.append((b, i, 1))
    T.sort()
    
    k = n // 2
    a = [0] * n
    b = [0] * n
    
    # Mark the top k participants from each semifinal
    for i in range(k):
        a[T[i][1]] = 1
        b[T[i][1]] = 1
    
    # Fill the remaining spots with the top n-2k performers from the rest
    for i in range(k, n):
        if T[i][-1] == 0:
            a[T[i][1]] = 1
        else:
            b[T[i][1]] = 1
    
    Ans = ''
    for i in range(n):
        Ans += str(a[i])
    Ans += '\n'
    for i in range(n):
        Ans += str(b[i])
    sys.stdout.write(Ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the top `k` participants from each semifinal are marked correctly and the remaining spots are filled according to the problem description.
