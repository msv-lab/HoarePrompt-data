The function processes two sorted lists, `A` and `B`, which contain the results of participants in the first and second semifinals respectively. It constructs two new lists, `a` and `b`, both initialized to all ones. It then iterates through a sorted list `T` containing pairs of indices and flags, setting the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` to zero based on the flags. Finally, it concatenates the binary representations of the elements in `a` and `b` into strings and outputs them.
