The code `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))` reads two space-separated integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Before this line of code, `n` and `m` are defined in the precondition as integers with specific ranges. After executing the code, these variables will now hold the actual integer values entered by the user, but their names and the fact that they are integers remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^5]; `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1] and they are determined by the input values.**
