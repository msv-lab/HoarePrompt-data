`a` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The input is expected to be an integer. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the values of `m` and `dp` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1] and greater than 2, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and `dp[a]` equal to `-1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `a` is an input integer and `a` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`.**
