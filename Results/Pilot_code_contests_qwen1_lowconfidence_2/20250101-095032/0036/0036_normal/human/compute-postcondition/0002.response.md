`dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. This initializes the first element of the `dp` list. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and all elements of the `dp` list except for `dp[0]` are still set to `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^5]; `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1]; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`.**
