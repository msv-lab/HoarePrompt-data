`ans` is increased by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. Given that the condition `step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0` is met, the value of `ans` is updated accordingly. The other variables (`prev`, `step - prev`, and `dp[step - prev]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is the opposite value of its original value, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.**
