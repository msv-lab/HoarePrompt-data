Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `prev` is 2
  - `step` is 1
  - `ans` is 0
  - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0
  - `dp[n + 1]` is 1
  - The condition `if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:` is checked, and no changes are made if this condition holds.

- For loop statement:
  ```python
  for prev in [1, 2]:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the values in the list `[1, 2]`.
2. **Previous Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `prev` was 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: The loop will execute for `prev = 2` again because it needs to cover both 1 and 2.

Since the loop will execute for `prev = 2` again, we need to ensure that the state is correctly set for the next iteration where `prev` is 2.

### Adjusted States:
- `prev` will remain 2 (since it is iterating over the same value again).
- `step` will be incremented to 2 (as the loop will execute for `prev = 2` again).
- `ans` will remain 0 unless the loop body changes it, but since no changes were made in the previous iteration, it remains 0.
- `dp` list will remain the same unless the loop body modifies it, but since no changes were made in the previous iteration, `dp` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- `prev` is 2
- `step` is 2
- `ans` is 0
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is 2, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
