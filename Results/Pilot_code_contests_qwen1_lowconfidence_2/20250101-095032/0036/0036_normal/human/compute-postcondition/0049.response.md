The line `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`), `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
