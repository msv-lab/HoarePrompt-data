Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `step` is 1.
- `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\).
- `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\).
- `dp` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for prev in [1, 2]:
    if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
        ans += dp[step - prev]
```

### Analysis

1. **First Iteration (prev = 1):**
   - Check `step - 1 >= 0` and `dp[step - 1] >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are true, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - 1]`.

2. **Second Iteration (prev = 2):**
   - Check `step - 2 >= 0` and `dp[step - 2] >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are true, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - 2]`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - For each subsequent iteration with `prev = 1` and `prev = 2`, the same checks are performed.
   - If the conditions are met, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - prev]`.

4. **Final Conditions:**
   - The loop continues until `step` exceeds `n`.

### Final State After All Iterations

Given that the loop increments `ans` based on the conditions specified, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will continue to run as long as `step <= n`.
- Each time the loop runs, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - 1]` or `dp[step - 2]` if the conditions are met.

Since the initial value of `dp[0]` is `1` and all other elements are `0`, the only way `dp[step - prev]` can be non-zero is if `step - prev` is `0`. This means the loop can increment `ans` only when `step - 1` or `step - 2` is `0`.

Thus, the loop will run `n` times, incrementing `ans` by `1` in the first iteration and by `0` in subsequent iterations because `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` will be `0` for `step > 1`.

### Output State

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `prev` can be either `1` or `2`.
- `step` will be equal to `n + 1` (since the loop runs `n` times and `step` starts from `1`).
- `ans` will be incremented by `1` in the first iteration and by `0` in subsequent iterations, making `ans` equal to `1`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is `n + 1`, `ans` is `1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`.**
