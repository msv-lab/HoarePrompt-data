The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, in this case, no loop is present, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
