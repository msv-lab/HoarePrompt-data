`a` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, which means `a` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^5], `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1], `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `i` is `0`, and `a` is an integer entered by the user.
