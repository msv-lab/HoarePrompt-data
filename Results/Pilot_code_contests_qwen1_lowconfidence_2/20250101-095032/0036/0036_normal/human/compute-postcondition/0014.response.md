Postcondition: **`step` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\), `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`. If `m == 0`, `dp` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dp` has `-1` for each `a` that was input during the loop, and all other elements remain `0`. The current value of `dp[step]` is less than 0.**
