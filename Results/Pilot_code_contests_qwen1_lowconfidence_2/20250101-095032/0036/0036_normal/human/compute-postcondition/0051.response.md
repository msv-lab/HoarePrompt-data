Postcondition: **`prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`), `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1. The difference between `step` and `prev` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
