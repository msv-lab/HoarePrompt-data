`ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - prev]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `prev` is 2 and `step` is 2, so `dp[step - prev]` is equivalent to `dp[2 - 2]` which is `dp[0]`. Since `dp[0]` is equal to 1, `ans` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is 2, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
