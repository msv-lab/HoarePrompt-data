State: **`n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^5], `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1], `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The for loop is defined as `for i in range(0, m)`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `0 <= i < m` must be true.
3. When the loop starts, `i` is set to 0.
4. Since `m` is within the range [0, n-1], the loop can potentially run from `i = 0` up to `m-1`.
5. At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 to satisfy the initial condition of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to include that `i` is initialized to 0.
