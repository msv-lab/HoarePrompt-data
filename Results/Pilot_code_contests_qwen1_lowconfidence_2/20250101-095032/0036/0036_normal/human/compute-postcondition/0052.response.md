The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to `ans`. Given the initial state, `dp[step - prev]` is equal to `dp[step - (n + 1)]`, which simplifies to `dp[n + 2 - (n + 1)]` or `dp[1]`. From the initial state, we know that `dp[1]` is equal to 0.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is updated by adding 0 to its current value, meaning `ans` remains unchanged. All other variables (`prev`, `step`, `ans`, and `dp`) retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`), `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
