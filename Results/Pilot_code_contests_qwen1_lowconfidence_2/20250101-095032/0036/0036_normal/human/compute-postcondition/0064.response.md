The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. The problem statement mentions constraints and relationships for variables `N` and `M`, and an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M`, but these are not passed as parameters to the function. 

Given the provided information, the function seems to operate based on these predefined constraints and does not have any return values specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate based on the given constraints without accepting any parameters and without returning any specific values.

Functionality: **The function operates based on the given constraints for variables N, M, and the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_M, without accepting any parameters and without returning any specific values.**
