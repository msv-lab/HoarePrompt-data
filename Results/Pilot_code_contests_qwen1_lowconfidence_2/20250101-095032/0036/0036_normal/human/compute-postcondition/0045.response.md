The code snippet `dp[step] = ans` assigns the value of `ans` to `dp[step]`. From the initial state, we know:

- `prev` is 2.
- `step` is `n + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of all elements in `dp` except `dp[n + 1]`.
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0.
- `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

Since `dp` is initialized such that all elements except `dp[0]` and `dp[n + 1]` are 0, and `dp[0]` and `dp[n + 1]` are both 1, the sum of all elements in `dp` except `dp[n + 1]` is simply `dp[0]`, which is 1. Thus, `ans` is 1.

Therefore, `dp[step]` (which is `dp[n + 1]`) is assigned the value of `ans`, which is 1. The value of `dp[n + 1]` remains 1, but now it is explicitly assigned from `ans`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
