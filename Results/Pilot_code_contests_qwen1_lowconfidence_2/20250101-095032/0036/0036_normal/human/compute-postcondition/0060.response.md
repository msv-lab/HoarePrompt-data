Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`).
- `step` is `n + 2`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

### Loop Code:
```python
for prev in [1, 2]:
    if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
        ans += dp[step - prev]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Iteration 1:**
   - `prev = 1`
   - `step = n + 2`
   - Check condition: `step - prev = (n + 2) - 1 = n + 1`
     - Since `dp[step - prev] = dp[n + 1] = 1`, the condition `dp[step - prev] >= 0` is true.
   - `ans += dp[n + 1] = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - No change to `prev` or `step`.

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - `prev = 2`
   - `step = n + 2`
   - Check condition: `step - prev = (n + 2) - 2 = n`
     - Since `dp[step - prev] = dp[n] = 0`, the condition `dp[step - prev] >= 0` is false.
   - No change to `ans`, `prev`, or `step`.

After these iterations, we observe the following:
- `prev` remains as the last used value, which is `2`.
- `step` remains as `n + 2`.
- `ans` is incremented by `1` during the first iteration.
- `dp` remains unchanged.

Since the loop only iterates twice (as per the given examples), and the conditions inside the loop do not cause any further changes, we can generalize this behavior.

### Final State:
- `prev` will be `2` (since `2` is the last value used in the loop).
- `step` will be `n + 2` (since the value of `step` is not changed inside the loop).
- `ans` will be `1` (since it is incremented by `1` during the first iteration and remains unchanged thereafter).
- `dp` will remain the same: a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1`, all other elements equal to `0`, and `dp[n + 1]` equal to `1`.

### Output State:
**Output State: `prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
