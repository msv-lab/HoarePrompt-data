`ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. The value of `prev` is either 1 or 2, and the value of `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `step` is either 1 or 2, making `step - prev` 0. The value of `dp[0]` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `dp[0]`.

Output State: **`prev` is the other value (if it was 1, it will be 2, and if it was 2, it will be 1), `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[0]`**
