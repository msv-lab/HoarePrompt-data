`ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. Given that `prev` is either 1 or 2 and `step` is 1, `step - prev` will be -1 or -2. Since the index `-1` and `-2` are out of bounds for the list `dp` (which starts from `0` and goes up to `n+1`), the expression `dp[step - prev]` will be interpreted as `0` because list indices in Python default to `0` when out of bounds.

Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `0`, which means `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
