According to the code, the loop condition is based on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1]. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `m` must still be within its valid range and greater than 2.

Given this, let's update the states:

1. `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
2. `m` must still be within the range [0, n-1] and greater than 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1] and greater than 2, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and `dp[a]` equal to `-1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `a` is an input integer**
