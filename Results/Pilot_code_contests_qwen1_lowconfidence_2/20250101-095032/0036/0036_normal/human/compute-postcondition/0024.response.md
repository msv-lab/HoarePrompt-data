Postcondition: ***`prev` is the other value (if it was 1, it will be 2, and if it was 2, it will be 1), `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[0]` since the condition `step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0` is met.***
