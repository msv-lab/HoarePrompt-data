`ans` is incremented by `dp[step - prev]`. Given the initial state, `prev` is `n + 1` and `step` is `n + 2`. Therefore, `step - prev` evaluates to `(n + 2) - (n + 1)` which simplifies to 1. So, `ans` is incremented by `dp[1]`.

From the initial state, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1. Thus, `dp[1]` is 0.

So, `ans` is incremented by 0, meaning `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is `n + 1`, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
