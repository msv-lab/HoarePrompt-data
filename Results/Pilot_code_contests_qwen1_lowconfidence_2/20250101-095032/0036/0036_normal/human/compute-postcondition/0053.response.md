Postcondition: ***`prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`), `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1. If `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, then no changes are made to `ans`, `dp`, `prev`, or `step`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`, `dp`, `prev`, or `step`.***
