According to the given code snippet, the for loop iterates over the values `[1, 2]` for the variable `prev`. The loop will execute for each value in this list. Let's break down the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute for both iterations of `prev`.

- The variable `prev` must take on the values `1` or `2` during the loop execution.
- The variable `step` is already set to `1`, so no adjustment is needed here.
- The variable `ans` is currently set to `0`, which is fine for initialization purposes.
- The list `dp` is already initialized as described: it has a length of `n + 1`, with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, and `dp[n + 1]` is `1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `prev` takes on the required values for the loop to execute correctly. Since `prev` must cycle through the values `1` and `2`, the initial state should reflect that `prev` is set to one of these values at the start of the loop.

State: **`prev` is either `1` or `2`, `step` is 1, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
