The code snippet provided is simply printing the value of `dp[n] % 1000000007`. There are no assignments or changes to any variables within this snippet. Therefore, the value of `dp[n]` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is `n + k`, `ans` is `1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, and `dp[n + k]` is `1`, `dp[n]` is unchanged**
