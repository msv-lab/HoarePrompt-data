Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`).
   - `step` is `n + 2`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `prev` with values `[1, 2]`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, then no changes are made to `ans`, `dp`, `prev`, or `step`.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`, `dp`, `prev`, or `step`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since we don't know the exact values of `prev` and `step` from the end of the previous iteration, let's assume they follow the initial conditions for simplicity.
   - `prev` is `n + 1`.
   - `step` is `n + 2`.

5. **Checking the Loop Condition:**
   - For `prev = 1`:
     - `step - prev = (n + 2) - 1 = n + 1`.
     - Since `n + 1` is non-negative, `step - prev >= 0`.
     - `dp[step - prev] = dp[n + 1]` which is 1 (non-negative).
     - Therefore, no changes are made.
   
   - For `prev = 2`:
     - `step - prev = (n + 2) - 2 = n`.
     - Since `n` is non-negative, `step - prev >= 0`.
     - `dp[step - prev] = dp[n]` which is 0 (not non-negative).
     - Therefore, no changes are made.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the specific values of `prev` and `step` from the end of the previous iteration, since both iterations (with `prev = 1` and `prev = 2`) do not change the states, the states remain the same.

**State:**
- `prev` is `n + 1`.
- `step` is `n + 2`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`prev` is `n + 1`, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
