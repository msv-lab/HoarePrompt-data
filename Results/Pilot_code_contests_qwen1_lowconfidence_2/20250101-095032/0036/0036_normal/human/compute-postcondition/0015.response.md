The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this context, since no loop is specified in the code snippet, and given the precondition, the variables `step`, `n`, `m`, and `dp` retain their previous values. The `continue` statement does not change any values or perform any operations.

Output State: **`step` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\), `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, and the current value of `dp[step]` is less than 0.**
