According to the code, the loop iterates over the values `[1, 2]` for the variable `prev`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop will execute for both values of `prev` if they meet certain conditions. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `prev` is either 1 or 2
- `step` is 1
- `ans` is 0
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0
- `dp[n + 1]` is 1
- No changes are made to the variables if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`

Since the loop iterates over both `1` and `2` for `prev`, the loop will execute again with the next value of `prev` unless one of the values does not satisfy the condition `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`.

Given that `step` is 1, the condition `step - prev >= 0` simplifies to `1 - prev >= 0`. This means:
- For `prev = 1`, `1 - 1 >= 0` is true.
- For `prev = 2`, `1 - 2 >= 0` is false.

Therefore, the loop will only execute for `prev = 1` because `prev = 2` does not satisfy the condition and no changes are made.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, we need to set `prev` to the next value in the sequence, which is `2`.

State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
