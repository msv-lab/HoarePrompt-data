Functionality: **The function processes an integer `N` and another integer `M`, along with a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M` such that `1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M <= N-1`. It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length `N+1` with `dp[0]` set to `1` and all other elements initialized to `0`. For each `a_i` in the sequence, it sets `dp[a_i]` to `-1`. Then, it updates the DP array to compute the number of ways to reach each index `i` from `0` to `N` using steps of size `1` or `2`, avoiding the indices marked as `-1`. Finally, it prints the value of `dp[N]` modulo `1000000007`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `m == 0`, the `dp` array remains with only `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements `0`.
- If any `a_i` exceeds `N-1`, the code does not handle this case explicitly; it should skip such values or raise an error.
- If the input sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M` contains duplicate values, the code will only mark one occurrence of each `a_i` in `dp` as `-1`.
- The function does not validate the inputs `N` and `M` to ensure they meet the specified constraints (e.g., `1 <= N <= 10^5` and `0 <= M <= N-1`).
