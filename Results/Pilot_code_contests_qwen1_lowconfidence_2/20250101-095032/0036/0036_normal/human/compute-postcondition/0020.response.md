`ans` is assigned an additional value of `dp[step - prev]`. The value of `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables (`prev`, `step`, and `dp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, step - `prev` is greater than or equal to 0, and `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0; `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`**
