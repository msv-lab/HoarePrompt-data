The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `prev`, `step`, `ans`, and `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`), `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
