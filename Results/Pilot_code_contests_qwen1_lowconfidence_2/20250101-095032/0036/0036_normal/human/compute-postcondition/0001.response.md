The code initializes a list `dp` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This list comprehension sets each element of the `dp` list to 0. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^5]; `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1]; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0.**
