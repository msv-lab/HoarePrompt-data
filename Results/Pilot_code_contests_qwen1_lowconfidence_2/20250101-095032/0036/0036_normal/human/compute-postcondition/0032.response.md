Postcondition: ***`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is 1. If `dp[step] < 0`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
