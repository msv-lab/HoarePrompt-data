Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`).
   - `step` is `n + 2`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for prev in [1, 2]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the values `[1, 2]`.
   - The variable `prev` takes on the values `1` and `2` during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `[1, 2]` must be iterable, meaning it must be a non-empty list or an iterable object containing exactly these two elements.
   - The variable `prev` will take on the values `1` and `2` during each iteration, but these values are already known and provided in the list.

5. **States to Adjust**:
   - Since the list `[1, 2]` is explicitly given and does not depend on any other variables or conditions, no additional states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
   - However, we need to ensure that `prev` is correctly set to `1` or `2` at the beginning of each iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are simply the ones provided initially.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prev` is the value that was used in the last iteration (which was `n + 1`), `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
