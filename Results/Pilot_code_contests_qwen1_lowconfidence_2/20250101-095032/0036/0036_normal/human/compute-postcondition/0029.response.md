`dp[step]` is assigned the value of `ans`. Given that `step` is `n + 1`, the value of `dp[n + 1]` is set to `ans`, which is `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is `n + 1`, `ans` is `1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is `1`.**
