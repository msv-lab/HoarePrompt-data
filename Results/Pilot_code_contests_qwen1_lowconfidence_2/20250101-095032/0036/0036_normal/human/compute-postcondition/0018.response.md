Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `step` is 1
   - `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\)
   - `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\)
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`
   - If `dp[step] < 0`, the value of `dp[step]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dp[step]` is `-1`
   - `ans` is 0

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop is iterating over the list `[1, 2]`, meaning `prev` takes on the values `1` and `2` in the loop.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what these values (`1` and `2`) might represent in terms of the state.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `prev` is one of the values in the list `[1, 2]`.
   - We need to ensure that the initial value of `prev` (before the loop starts) is either `1` or `2`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `prev` can take on the values `1` or `2` during the loop execution, the initial value of `prev` should be set to one of these values.
   - All other given states (`step`, `n`, `m`, `dp`, and `ans`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute based on the provided information.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is the value of `prev`, which should be set to either `1` or `2`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`prev` is 1 or 2**
