The line `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
