The code `dp[step] = ans` updates the value of `dp[step]` to be equal to `ans`. Given that `step` is defined as `n + 2`, and `ans` is currently 1, the value of `dp[n + 2]` is set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1, `dp[n + 2]` is 1.**
