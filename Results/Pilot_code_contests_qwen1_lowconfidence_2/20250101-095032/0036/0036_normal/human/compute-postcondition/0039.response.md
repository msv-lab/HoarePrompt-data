`ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - prev]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `prev` is 2 and `step` is 1, so `step - prev` equals `1 - 2`, which is `-1`. Since `dp` is a list with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, `dp[-1]` does not exist in the list, but for the purpose of this calculation, it would be considered 0 because it's out of bounds. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + 0`, meaning `ans` remains unchanged.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
