The code assigns `-1` to `dp[a]`. Given the initial state, `a` is an integer entered by the user, and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements initially set to `0`. After the assignment, `dp[a]` will be `-1`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, and `dp`) remain unchanged except for `dp[a]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^5], `m` is an integer within the range [0, n-1], `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `i` is `0`, `dp[a]` is `-1`**
