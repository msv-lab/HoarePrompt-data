Postcondition: ***`step` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\), `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, and if `dp[step] < 0`, the value of `dp[step]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the value of `dp[step]` is `-1`.***
