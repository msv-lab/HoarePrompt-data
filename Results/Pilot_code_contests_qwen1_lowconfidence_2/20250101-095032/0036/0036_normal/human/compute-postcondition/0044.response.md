To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `prev` is either 1 or 2.
   - `step` is initially 1.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0.
   - `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `prev` with possible values of 1 and 2.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`.
     - If both conditions are true, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - prev]`.

3. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - **1st iteration**: No change if the conditions are not met, otherwise no changes.
   - **2nd iteration**: No change if the conditions are not met, otherwise no changes.
   - **3rd iteration**: `prev` becomes 2, `step` becomes 2, `ans` becomes 1, `dp` remains unchanged.

From these observations, we can infer the following:
- The loop will continue to iterate as long as `step` is within the bounds of the `dp` list (i.e., `0 <= step <= n + 1`).
- The loop updates `ans` based on the values of `dp[step - prev]` when the conditions are met.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop, the variables will be in the following state:
- `prev` will always be 2 because the loop only updates `prev` to 2 after the first iteration and does not change it further.
- `step` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `step` until it reaches `n + 1`.
- `ans` will contain the sum of `dp[step - prev]` for all valid `prev` values, which essentially means `ans` will be the sum of all elements in `dp` except `dp[n + 1]`.
- `dp` remains unchanged from its initial state.

### Conclusion

Output State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `dp` except `dp[n + 1]`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, `dp[n + 1]` is 1.**
