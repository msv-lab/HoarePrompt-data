Postcondition: **`prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1. If `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, then `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - prev]`. Otherwise, the values of `prev`, `step`, `ans`, and `dp` remain unchanged.**
