Postcondition: ***`prev` is either 1 or 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is 1. If `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, no changes are made to the variables.***

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the variables `prev`, `step`, `ans`, `dp` retain their initial states specified in the precondition.
