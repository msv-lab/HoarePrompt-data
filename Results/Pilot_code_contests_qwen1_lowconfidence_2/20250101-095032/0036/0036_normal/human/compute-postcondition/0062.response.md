Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is `n + k` (where `k` is a non-negative integer), `ans` is `1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, and `dp[n + k]` is `1`.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\).
   - `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\).
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0` if `m == 0`; otherwise, `dp` is a list where `dp[a]` is `-1` for each `a` that was input during the loop, and all other elements remain `0`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` inclusive.
   - The inner loop iterates over `[1, 2]` and updates `ans` based on the condition `dp[step - prev] >= 0`.
   - If `dp[step] < 0`, the outer loop skips the current iteration and continues to the next one.

3. **Observations from Given Output States**:
   - After 1 iteration: `step` is `n + 1`, `dp[n + 1]` is `1`.
   - After 2 iterations: `step` is `n + 1`, `dp[n + 1]` is `1`.
   - After 3 iterations: `step` is `n + 2`, `dp[n + 2]` is `1`.

4. **General Pattern**:
   - The `step` variable increments by 1 each time the loop completes an iteration.
   - The `dp` list is updated such that `dp[n + k]` becomes `1` after `k` iterations.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will eventually execute up to `n + 1` times, updating `dp` accordingly.
   - After all iterations, `dp` will have `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements remain `0` (if `m == 0`), or `dp` will have `dp[n + k]` equal to `1` for the last `k` values of `step` (if `m != 0`).

Thus, the final output state of the loop is:

**Output State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is `n + k` (where `k` is a non-negative integer), `ans` is `1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, and `dp[n + k]` is `1`.**
