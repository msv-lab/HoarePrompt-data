According to the code, the loop iterates over the values `[1, 2]`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `prev` is the other value (if it was 1, it will be 2, and if it was 2, it will be 1).
- `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `ans` is increased by `dp[0]` since the condition `step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0` is met.

The loop will execute again based on the value of `prev` in the sequence `[1, 2]`.

To determine which state needs to be adjusted for the next iteration, we need to consider both possible values of `prev`:

1. If `prev` was 1 in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration `prev` will be 2.
2. If `prev` was 2 in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration `prev` will be 1.

In either case, the condition `step - prev` being greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[step - prev]` being greater than or equal to 0 must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `prev` from the previous iteration, we can consider both scenarios. However, the key states to adjust will be `prev`, `step - prev`, and `dp[step - prev]`.

State: **`prev` is the opposite value (if it was 1, it will be 2, and if it was 2, it will be 1), `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[0]` since the condition `step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0` is met.**
