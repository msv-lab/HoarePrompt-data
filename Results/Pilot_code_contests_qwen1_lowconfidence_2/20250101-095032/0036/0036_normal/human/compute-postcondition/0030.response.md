According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `step`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `prev` is either `1` or `2`, `step` is `n + 1`, `ans` is `1`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, and `dp[n + 1]` is `1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `step` must be within the range of `1` to `n + 1`. Since `step` is currently `n + 1`, the loop cannot execute again because it has already reached the upper limit of the range.

However, if we consider the next possible value for `step` that would allow the loop to execute again, `step` should be `1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`prev` is 1 or 2, `step` is 1, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`, `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
