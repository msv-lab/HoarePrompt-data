Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\).
- `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\).
- `dp` is a list of length \(n + 1\) with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(0, m):
    a = int(raw_input())
    dp[a] = -1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = m-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `m` times if `m > 0`.

2. **Variable Changes**:
   - Each iteration of the loop takes an input integer `a` from the user.
   - It then sets `dp[a]` to `-1`.

3. **State After Loop Execution**:
   - If `m > 0`, the loop will set `dp[a]` to `-1` for each of the `m` inputs provided.
   - The values of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged from their initial values unless modified outside the loop.
   - The `dp` list will have its `dp[a]` element set to `-1` for each `a` that was input during the loop.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `m == 0`, the loop will not run at all, so no changes will be made to the `dp` list. `dp` will remain as initially defined.

### Conclusion:

- If `m > 0`, the `dp` list will have `dp[a]` set to `-1` for each `a` that was input during the loop.
- If `m == 0`, the `dp` list remains unchanged with `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements equal to `0`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \([1, 10^5]\), `m` is an integer within the range \([0, n-1]\), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to `1` and all other elements equal to `0` if `m == 0`; otherwise, `dp` is a list where `dp[a]` is `-1` for each `a` that was input during the loop, and all other elements remain `0`.**
