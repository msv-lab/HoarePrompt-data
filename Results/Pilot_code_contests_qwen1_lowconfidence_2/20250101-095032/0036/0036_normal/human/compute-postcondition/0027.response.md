Postcondition: ***`prev` is the opposite value of its original value, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
