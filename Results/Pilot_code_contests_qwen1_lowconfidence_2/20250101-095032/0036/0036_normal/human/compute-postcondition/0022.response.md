According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `prev`. The loop iterates over the list `[1, 2]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows: `prev` is 1 or 2, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, and `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the possible values for `prev`:

1. If `prev` was 1, it can now be set to 2.
2. If `prev` was 2, it can now be set to 1.

However, since the loop iterates over both 1 and 2, we need to ensure that the condition `step - prev` is still greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[step - prev]` is still greater than or equal to 0.

Since the loop iterates over both values in the list `[1, 2]`, we need to consider the next value for `prev`. Therefore, if `prev` was 1, the next iteration should start with `prev` being 2, and if `prev` was 2, the next iteration should start with `prev` being 1.

Given the constraints, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `prev` will be the other value (if it was 1, it will be 2, and vice versa).
- The condition `step - prev` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
- The condition `dp[step - prev]` must still be greater than or equal to 0.

Since the exact value of `prev` from the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the state generally as:
- `prev` will switch to the other value (either 1 or 2).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`prev` is the other value (if it was 1, it will be 2, and if it was 2, it will be 1), `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, and `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0**.
