The code `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to it. From the initial state, `prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.

First, calculate `step - prev`:
- `step` is `n + 2`
- `prev` is 2
- So, `step - prev` is `(n + 2) - 2`, which simplifies to `n`.

Next, find the value of `dp[n]`:
- From the initial state, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.
- Therefore, `dp[n]` is 0.

Now, add this value to `ans`:
- Initially, `ans` is 0.
- Adding 0 to `ans` keeps `ans` as 0.

After updating `ans`, the values of other variables (`prev`, `step`, `dp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
