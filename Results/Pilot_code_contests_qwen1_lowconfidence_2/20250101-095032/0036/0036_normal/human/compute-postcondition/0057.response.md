Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the values in the list `[1, 2]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `prev` is `n + 1`
   - `step` is `n + 2`
   - `ans` is 0
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1.
   - If `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`, no changes occur. Otherwise, no changes occur due to the absence of an else part.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over two values: `1` and `2`.
   - For the first iteration (`prev = 1`), `step = n + 2`, so `step - prev = (n + 2) - 1 = n + 1`.
   - Since `dp[n + 1]` is 1, the condition `dp[step - prev] >= 0` is satisfied, and no changes occur.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will now iterate with the next value in the list, which is `2`.
   - Therefore, `prev` will be set to `2`.
   - `step` remains `n + 2`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `prev` becomes `2`.
   - `step` remains `n + 2`.

6. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `prev` is `2`
   - `step` is `n + 2`
   - `ans` remains `0`
   - `dp` remains as it was initially defined (a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`prev` is 2, `step` is `n + 2`, `ans` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1**
