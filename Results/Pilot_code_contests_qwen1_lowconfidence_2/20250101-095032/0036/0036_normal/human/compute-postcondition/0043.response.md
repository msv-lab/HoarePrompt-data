Postcondition: ***`prev` is 2, `step` is 2, `ans` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[0]` equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, and `dp[n + 1]` is 1. Since there is no else part, the conditions and values remain as specified in the if part regardless of the if condition evaluation.***
