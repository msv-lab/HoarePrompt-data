Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple steps are broken. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach but fails to reset the state of steps that become valid again after being marked as invalid due to subsequent broken steps. This leads to incorrect counts for paths that avoid broken steps. The output hints confirm that the program sets `dp[a_i]` to `-1` for broken steps and then updates the DP array to compute the number of ways to reach each index, but it does not correctly reset the states for steps that become valid again after being marked as invalid. This results in incorrect counts, as demonstrated by the example provided:

```
6 2
3
4
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly count paths, leading to a non-zero result instead of the correct result of `0`. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
