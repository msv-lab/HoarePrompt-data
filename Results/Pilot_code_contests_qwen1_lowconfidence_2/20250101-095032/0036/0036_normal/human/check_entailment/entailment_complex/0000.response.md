Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values \(N\) and \(M\) from standard input using `raw_input()`. This is consistent with the problem statement which mentions that the input should be processed from standard input.
   - It also correctly handles the sequence of broken steps \(a_1, a_2, ..., a_M\) by marking them in the dynamic programming (DP) array `dp`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized to handle the number of ways to reach each step. `dp[0]` is set to 1 because there is exactly one way to stay at the ground (0-th) step initially.
   - For steps that are broken (`a_i`), `dp[a_i]` is set to -1, indicating that it is not possible to land on these steps.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition:**
   - The program iterates over each step from 1 to \(N\) and checks if it is broken (`dp[step] < 0`). If it is broken, the loop continues to the next step.
   - For each non-broken step, it calculates the number of ways to reach that step by considering the previous two steps (`step - 1` and `step - 2`), ensuring it avoids broken steps.
   - The result for each step is stored in the DP array, effectively building up the solution for all steps up to \(N\).

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final result `dp[N]` is printed modulo \(1000000007\), which is consistent with the requirement to output the number of ways modulo a large prime number to prevent overflow.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases appropriately by initializing `dp[0]` to 1 and marking broken steps as -1. The constraints mentioned in the problem description are respected.

Since the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and correctly handles the input and constraints, it meets the requirements and is thus correct.
