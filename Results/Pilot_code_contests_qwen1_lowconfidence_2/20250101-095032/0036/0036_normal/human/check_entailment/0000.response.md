Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where both `one-step` and `two-step` movements are allowed, but the broken steps should be avoided. Specifically, the program continues to process steps even if they are marked as broken (`dp[a] = -1`), which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 1
3
```
The correct output should be `4` because the valid ways to reach the 6th step are: `1->2->3->4->5->6`, `1->2->4->5->6`, `1->3->4->5->6`, and `2->3->4->5->6`. However, the program incorrectly handles the broken step at the 3rd position and does not account for these paths properly.

To fix this, the program should stop processing once a broken step is encountered and ensure that only valid steps are considered in the dynamic programming array. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    broken_steps = set(map(int, input().split()))
    
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if step in broken_steps:
            dp[step] = 0
        else:
            dp[step] = (dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]) % 1000000007
    
    print(dp[n])

func()
```

This version uses a set to store broken steps and ensures that only valid steps are considered in the dynamic programming array, thus correctly handling the problem constraints.
