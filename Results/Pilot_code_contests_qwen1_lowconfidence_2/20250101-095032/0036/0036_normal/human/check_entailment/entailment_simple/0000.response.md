Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Modulo Operation Missing**: The problem description explicitly states that the final answer should be printed modulo \(1,000,000,007\). However, the program does not perform this modulo operation on the result stored in `dp[n]`. Instead, it prints `dp[n]` directly without taking the modulo.

2. **Handling of Broken Steps**: While the program correctly marks the broken steps by setting `dp[a]` to `-1`, it does not handle the situation where climbing from a broken step to another step is not allowed. Specifically, the logic for calculating `dp[step]` needs to ensure that if `step - prev` is a broken step, the corresponding value should not contribute to the count.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split(' '))
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a = int(input())
        dp[a] = -1
    
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        
        ans = 0
        
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        
        dp[step] = ans % MOD
    
    print(dp[n])

func()
```

### Why the Corrected Program Works:
1. **Modulo Operation**: The `dp[step] = ans % MOD` line ensures that the final count is taken modulo \(1,000,000,007\).
2. **Proper Handling of Broken Steps**: The program correctly handles the situation where `step - prev` is a broken step by checking `dp[step - prev] >= 0` before adding its value to `ans`.

By addressing these issues, the program now accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
