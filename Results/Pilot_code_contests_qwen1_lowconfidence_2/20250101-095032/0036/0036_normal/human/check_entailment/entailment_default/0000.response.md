Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when a step is broken and both `1` and `2` steps lead to a broken step. Specifically, the code updates the DP array to avoid steps marked as `-1`, but it does not correctly update the DP values for steps that are reachable by both `1` and `2` steps when a step is broken. 

For example, consider the following scenario:
- \( N = 5 \)
- \( M = 1 \)
- \( a_1 = 3 \)

In this case, the broken step is the 3rd step. The correct number of ways to reach the 5th step would be 2 (by taking 2 steps from 0 to 2 and then 3 steps from 2 to 5, or by taking 1 step from 0 to 1, then 2 steps from 1 to 3, and finally 2 steps from 3 to 5). However, the current implementation would incorrectly count 0 ways to reach the 5th step because it marks the 3rd step as `-1` and skips it, not updating the DP value for the 5th step correctly.

The correct implementation should ensure that the DP value for each step is updated correctly even if it leads to a broken step, by considering the contributions from both `1` and `2` steps appropriately.
