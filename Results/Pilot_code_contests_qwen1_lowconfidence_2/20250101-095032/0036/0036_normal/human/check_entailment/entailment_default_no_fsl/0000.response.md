Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where multiple broken steps are consecutive. Specifically, the code marks a step as `-1` when it encounters a broken step, but it does not reset the DP values for subsequent steps that would normally be reachable from the broken step. This means that if there are consecutive broken steps, the DP values for steps in between these broken steps are not properly updated, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 2
3
4
```

In this case, the steps 3 and 4 are broken. The code marks `dp[3]` and `dp[4]` as `-1`, but it does not reset `dp[2]` because `dp[3]` is `-1`. As a result, the value of `dp[5]` will be computed incorrectly, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the code needs to reset the DP values for steps that are between consecutive broken steps. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    broken_steps = set()
    
    for i in range(m):
        a = int(input())
        broken_steps.add(a)
    
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if step in broken_steps:
            dp[step] = -1
            continue
        
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        
        dp[step] = ans % 1000000007
    
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)
```

This corrected version uses a set to track broken steps and ensures that the DP values are reset correctly for steps between consecutive broken steps.
