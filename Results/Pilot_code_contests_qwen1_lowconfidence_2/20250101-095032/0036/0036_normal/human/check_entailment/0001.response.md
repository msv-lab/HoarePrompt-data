Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple steps are broken. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach but fails to reset the state of steps that become valid again after being marked as invalid due to subsequent broken steps. This leads to incorrect counts for paths that avoid broken steps.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 2
3
4
```

In this case, steps 3 and 4 are broken. The correct count of ways to reach the 6th step without stepping on broken steps should be 0, as no valid path exists. However, the provided program will incorrectly count the paths, leading to a non-zero result. This is because the program marks step 3 as invalid but does not properly adjust the states for subsequent steps, causing it to miss the fact that step 4 cannot be used to reach the 6th step either.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the reset of states more carefully, ensuring that once a step becomes invalid due to a broken step, all subsequent steps that depend on it are also recalculated appropriately.
