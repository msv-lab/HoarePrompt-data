The function processes an integer `N` and another integer `M`, along with a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_M` such that `1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M <= N-1`. It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length `N+1` with `dp[0]` set to `1` and all other elements initialized to `0`. For each `a_i` in the sequence, it sets `dp[a_i]` to `-1`. Then, it updates the DP array to compute the number of ways to reach each index `i` from `0` to `N` using steps of size `1` or `2`, avoiding the indices marked as `-1`. Finally, it prints the value of `dp[N]` modulo `1000000007`.
