The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a crossword grid and two indices `i` and `j`. It checks whether the placeholder character `_` is present in the i-th row or the j-th column of the matrix. If `_` is found in either the specified row or column, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function temporarily replaces the character at position `(i, j)` with `_` to perform the check, but restores it before returning the result. Potential edge cases include when `i` or `j` are out of bounds of the matrix dimensions, although the code does not explicitly handle these cases, making them undefined behavior.
