#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, matrix is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the grid containing only lowercase Latin letters, and selected_words is an empty string initially used to accumulate the final answer.

    n, m = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n` and equals `n - 1`, `j` is less than `m` and equals `m - 1`, `m` is a positive integer, `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.
    print(selected_words)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a grid represented by a 2D list `matrix` of size `n x m`. For each character in the grid, it calls `func_2(matrix, i, j)` to determine whether to include the character in the final answer stored in `selected_words`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all characters, the function prints `selected_words`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is never called for certain positions due to logical errors or omissions, those characters might not be included in `selected_words`.
2. If `func_2` always returns `True`, then `selected_words` will be an empty string since no characters would be added.
3. The function assumes `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `matrix` is a valid 2D list. If these assumptions are violated, the behavior is undefined.
4. The function does not handle non-lowercase Latin letters in the grid, although the grid is specified to contain only such letters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter, and i, j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]).
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result
    #The program returns result which is True if '_' is present in the i-th row or the j-th column, otherwise result is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a crossword grid and two indices `i` and `j`. It checks whether the placeholder character `_` is present in the i-th row or the j-th column of the matrix. If `_` is found in either the specified row or column, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function temporarily replaces the character at position `(i, j)` with `_` to perform the check, but restores it before returning the result. Potential edge cases include when `i` or `j` are out of bounds of the matrix dimensions, although the code does not explicitly handle these cases, making them undefined behavior.
