Postcondition: ***`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, `selected_words` is concatenated with `matrix[i][1]`. Otherwise, the value of `selected_words` remains unchanged.***
