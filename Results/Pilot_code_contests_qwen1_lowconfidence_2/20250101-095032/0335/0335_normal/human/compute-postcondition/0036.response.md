Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer.**

Explanation:
- The outer loop runs `n` times.
- Each iteration of the outer loop reads a line of input (`letters`) and processes it.
- The inner loop converts the string `letters` into a list of characters (`row`).
- The list `row` is appended to `matrix`.
- After all iterations, `matrix` will contain `n` rows, each row being a list of characters from the corresponding input line.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was the input parameter for the number of iterations the loop would run.
