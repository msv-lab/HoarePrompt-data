The code `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` updates the variable `selected_words` by adding the value of `matrix[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0. However, the specific value of `matrix[i][j]` is not provided, so we will represent it as `char`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The Output State is: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0; `selected_words` is equal to `char` (where `char` is the character at position `[i][j]` in `matrix`); the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False.
