According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`, meaning `i` was incremented by 1 and is now equal to its original value plus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

To determine the new state, we need to adjust `i` to be incremented by 1 again. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` (which means `i` will be incremented by 1 again), and it must still be less than `n`.

The other variables (`matrix`, `j`, `m`, and `selected_words`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop condition.

State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` is `m`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`**
