The code `print(selected_words)` simply prints the value of `selected_words` without changing its value or affecting any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n` and equals `n - 1`, `j` is less than `m` and equals `m - 1`, `m` is a positive integer, `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.**
