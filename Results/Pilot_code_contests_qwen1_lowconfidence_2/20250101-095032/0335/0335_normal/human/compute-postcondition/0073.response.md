Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n` and equals `n - 1`, `j` is less than `m` and equals `m - 1`, `m` is a positive integer, `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.**

### Explanation:
- **Matrix:** The matrix is a list of lists, containing `n` rows and `m` columns, with each cell being a character. The loop iterates over every row (`i`) and every column (`j`), so after the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` and `j` will be `m-1`.
- **i and j:** After the loop completes, `i` will be the last row index (`n-1`) and `j` will be the last column index (`m-1`).
- **m:** The variable `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns in the matrix, and it remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **selected_words:** This string accumulates characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. Since the loop runs until all elements in the matrix are checked, `selected_words` will contain all such characters.

### Summary:
- If the loop executes completely, `i` and `j` will both reach their maximum values (`n-1` and `m-1` respectively).
- `selected_words` will contain all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.
- If the loop does not execute at all (e.g., when `n` or `m` is 0), the values of `i`, `j`, and `selected_words` remain as they were initially set in the initial state.
