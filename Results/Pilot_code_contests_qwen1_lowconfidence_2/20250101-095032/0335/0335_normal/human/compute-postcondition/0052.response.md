The code appends the character at `matrix[i][j]` to the variable `selected_words`. Initially, `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`, `j` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer. The function `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. After executing the line of code, `selected_words` will contain the character from `matrix[i][j]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`; `j` is 0; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]; func_2(matrix, i, j) returns False.**
