Postcondition: ***`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`; `j` is 1; `m` is a positive integer; if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]` and has been updated to include `matrix[i][j]`. There is no change in the case where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns True.***
