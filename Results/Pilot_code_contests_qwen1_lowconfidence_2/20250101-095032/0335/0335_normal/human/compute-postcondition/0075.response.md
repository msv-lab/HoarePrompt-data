The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: two positive integers `n` and `m`, which represent the dimensions of the grid; a 2D list `matrix` of strings where each string represents a row of the grid containing only lowercase Latin letters; and an empty string `selected_words` initially used to accumulate the final answer. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information, but it modifies the `selected_words` string.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m` (positive integers), `matrix` (a 2D list of strings), and `selected_words` (an empty string). It processes the matrix and updates `selected_words` with the final answer, but no explicit return value is mentioned.**
