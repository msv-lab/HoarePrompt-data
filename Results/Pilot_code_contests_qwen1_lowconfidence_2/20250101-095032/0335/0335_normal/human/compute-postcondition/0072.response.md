Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` is in the range `0` to `-1` (i.e., the loop has executed `m` times and `j` has become negative); `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]` (with the character `matrix[i][j]` duplicated) if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `True`, `selected_words` remains unchanged.**
