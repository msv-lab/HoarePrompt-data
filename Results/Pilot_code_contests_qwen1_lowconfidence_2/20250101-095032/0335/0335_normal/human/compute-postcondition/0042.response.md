Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is 0.
- `m` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, then `selected_words` is equal to `matrix[i][0]`.

### Loop Statement
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Current Values at the Start of the Current Iteration:**
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is 0 (start of the loop).
   - `m` is a positive integer greater than 0.

2. **What Changes During the Loop Execution?**
   - The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `matrix` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `selected_words` remains unchanged as it is only assigned if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, and this assignment does not depend on `j`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` is still less than `n`.
- `j` is now 1.
- `m` is still a positive integer greater than 0.
- `matrix` remains the same.
- `selected_words` remains the same.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0.**
