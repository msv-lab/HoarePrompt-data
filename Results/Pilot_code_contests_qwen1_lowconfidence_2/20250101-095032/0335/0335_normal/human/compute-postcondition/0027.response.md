The code `row = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `row`. This clears the content of `row`, making it an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is the input string from the user, `row` is an empty list, `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both `row`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**
