Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters.
   - `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`.
   - `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-1`.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was in the range `0` to `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `0` to `m-1`, but it must be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains the same because the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - Since `j` was in the range `0` to `m-1`, the new value of `j` should be `1` if `j` was `0`, `2` if `j` was `1`, and so on until `m-1` becomes `m-2`.

5. **New Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-2`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]`.**
