According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop condition is that `j` should be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`, `j` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and remain less than `m`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1 (incremented by 1 from 0). The state remains unchanged for other variables as they are not affected by this loop iteration.

State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`; `j` is 1; `m` is a positive integer; if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]`.**
