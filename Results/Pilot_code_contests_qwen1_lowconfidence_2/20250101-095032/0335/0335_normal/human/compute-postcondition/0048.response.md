Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column index `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.
- For each iteration, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character `matrix[i][j]` is appended to `selected_words`.
- After the loop completes, `selected_words` will contain all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` was `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `m` is 0 or `i` is not less than `n`), then:
- `matrix` remains as initially provided.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is 0 (since the loop does not increment `j`).
- `m` is 0.
- `selected_words` remains as its initial value, which is an empty string (`""`).
