The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `matrix`, `i`, and `j`. 

- `matrix` is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter.
- `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]).

If the character '_' is present in the i-th row or the j-th column of the matrix, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a 2D list `matrix`, and two indices `i` and `j`, and return `True` if '_' is present in the i-th row or the j-th column, otherwise return `False`.
