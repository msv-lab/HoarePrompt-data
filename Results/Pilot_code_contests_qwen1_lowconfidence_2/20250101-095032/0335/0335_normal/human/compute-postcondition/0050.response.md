State before the loop starts: According to the given information, `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `m`, and `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.

Now, let's analyze the for loop:

```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This for loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `m` is a non-negative integer.

### Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - Initially, `j` is set to `m`.
   - The loop will start with `j = 0` and increment `j` until `j < m` (i.e., `j` reaches `m`).

2. **Condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `m` is a non-negative integer. If `m` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute at all because `range(m)` would return an empty sequence.

3. **State adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `m` is a positive integer so that the loop can start and iterate properly.
   - `i` should remain less than `n` and should be consistent with the initial condition `i = i + 1`.
   - `j` should start at `0` when the loop begins.

### Final state after adjustment:

- `matrix` remains as a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters.
- `i` remains less than `n` and should be consistent with the initial condition `i = i + 1`.
- `j` must start at `0` and increase until it reaches `m-1`.
- `m` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters, `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be a positive integer**, and `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.
