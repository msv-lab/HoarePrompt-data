Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `letters` is a non-empty string.
   - `row` is a list containing `letter`.
   - `matrix` is a list containing two elements, and each element is `row`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over each `letter` in `letters`.

3. **What happens in each iteration?**
   - In each iteration, a new `letter` from `letters` is processed.
   - `i` starts as `n + 1` and does not change within the loop.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was `n + 1` initially and does not change, it remains `n + 1` after the first iteration.
   - The `letter` that was processed in the first iteration is now one less in the `letters` string.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more `letter` in `letters`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `letters` must still be a non-empty string but one letter shorter than before.
   - `row` and `matrix` remain unchanged since they are not modified by the loop.
   - `i` remains `n + 1` because it does not change inside the loop.
   - `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`letters` is a non-empty string (one letter shorter), `row` is a list containing `letter`, `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both `row`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**
