The code snippet updates `selected_words` by adding the character from `matrix[i][j]` to `selected_words`. Given the precondition:

- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters.
- `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`.
- `j` is 2.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]` and has been updated to include `matrix[i][j]`. Otherwise, there is no change in `selected_words`.

Since `func_2(matrix, i, j)` does not affect the outcome here, we consider the condition where it returns False (as per the initial state). Thus, `selected_words` will include the character from `matrix[i][j]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`; `j` is 2; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]`**
