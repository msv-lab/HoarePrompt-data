`selected_words` is assigned the value of `selected_words` plus `matrix[i][j]`. Since `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, the condition to add `matrix[i][j]` to `selected_words` is met, so `selected_words` is updated accordingly. The value of `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`, `j` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer. The state of the `matrix` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`; `j` is 1; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]` and has been updated to include `matrix[i][j]`.**
