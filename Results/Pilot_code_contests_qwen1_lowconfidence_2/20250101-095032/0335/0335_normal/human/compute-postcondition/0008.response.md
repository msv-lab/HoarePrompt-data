Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `row` is a list with `letter` appended to it.
   - `letter` is the last element of `row`.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the `letters` list using a variable named `letter`.
   - At the end of each iteration, the current `letter` is used in some operation or logic, but we don't know the exact details since the loop body is omitted.

3. **Next Iteration Considerations**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, the loop variable `letter` must come from the `letters` list.
   - Since `letter` is the last element of `row` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the `letter` used in the current iteration was the last element of `letters` (assuming `letters` is a finite list).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - After the current iteration, the `letter` variable will take the next value from the `letters` list if it exists.
   - If `letters` still has elements left, the next `letter` will be the next item in the `letters` list.
   - If `letters` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- The `letter` variable will be set to the next value from the `letters` list.
- The `row` list will remain the same unless the loop body appends or modifies it, but since no specific operations are mentioned, we assume it remains unchanged for the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`row` is a list with `letter` appended to it, `letter` is its last element**. 

Since we don't have additional information about the modifications inside the loop body, the state remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
