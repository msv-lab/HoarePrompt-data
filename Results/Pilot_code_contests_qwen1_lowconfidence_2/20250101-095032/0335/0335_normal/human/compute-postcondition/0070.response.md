`selected_words` is updated by adding the character `matrix[i][j]` to it. The value of `matrix[i][j]` is added to `selected_words`, which means `selected_words` now includes the character `matrix[i][j]` twice because of the precondition that states `selected_words` already contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]` (with the character `matrix[i][j]` duplicated) if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-3`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]` (with the character `matrix[i][j]` duplicated) if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, and the character `matrix[i][j]` is added to `selected_words`.**
