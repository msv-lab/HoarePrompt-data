The code snippet `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` adds the character `matrix[i][j]` to the existing string `selected_words`. Based on the initial state, `selected_words` contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]`.

Given this, before the line of code is executed, `selected_words` already includes `matrix[i][j]`. Now, adding `matrix[i][j]` again will duplicate this character in `selected_words`. However, since the task requires adherence to the initial condition and the actual value of `selected_words` isn't provided, we should represent the updated `selected_words` as including the current `matrix[i][j]` twice.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-2`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]` (with the character `matrix[i][j]` duplicated).**
