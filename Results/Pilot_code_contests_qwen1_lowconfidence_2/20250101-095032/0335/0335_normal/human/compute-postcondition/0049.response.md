According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n` and `j` is equal to `m`.

Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can continue. However, `j` is equal to `m`, and since `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` cannot be incremented further within the same row. Therefore, `i` must be incremented to proceed to the next row.

The state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
- `j` remains equal to `m`.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `m`, `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`**.
