Output State: **`letters` is an input string from the user, `row` is a list containing all the characters of `letters`, `matrix` is a list containing only one element which is `row`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `row` is an empty list, and `i` is set to 1. The loop runs for each character in `letters`.
- After the loop executes, `row` will contain all the characters from `letters`.
- Since the loop appends each character to `row`, and the loop runs for `n` times (where `n` is the length of `letters`), `row` will eventually contain all characters from `letters`.
- `matrix` is initialized with `row`, so it contains only one element, which is `row`.
- `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes, where `n` is the length of `letters`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 ensures that the loop executes at least once. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and `row` remains empty, `matrix` remains as `[row]`, and `i` is still 1. However, since `n` must be greater than 1, the loop will always run at least once, making `row` and `matrix` as described above.
