Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters.
- `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`.
- `j` is `m`.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `selected_words` contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - We need to ensure that `j` is within the valid range for the loop to execute properly.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is set such that `i < n` and `i = i + 2`. This means `i` is an odd number if it starts from 0 (assuming `i` starts from 0 or 1).
   - `j` is initially set to `m`, which is a positive integer.
   - The `range(m)` function will generate values from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-1`.
   - Since `j` is initially set to `m`, it will not be in this range unless `m` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Matrix Validity:**
   - The matrix `matrix` must be valid and accessible. There are no direct constraints given about `matrix`, but we need to ensure that the indices used within the loop are valid.
   - The condition `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returning `False` is not directly affecting the loop execution but might affect the values in `selected_words`.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be within the range `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to a value within this range.
   - `i` is already set to a valid position based on the given conditions (`i < n` and `i = i + 2`).

### Conclusion:
The main adjustment needed is to ensure `j` is within the range `0` to `m-1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-1`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`**.
