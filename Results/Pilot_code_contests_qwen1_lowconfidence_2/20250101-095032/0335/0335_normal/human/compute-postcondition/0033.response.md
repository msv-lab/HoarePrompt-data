The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Before this operation, `row` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `letter`. After appending `letter`, `row` will contain three elements, all of which are `letter`.

- `matrix` remains unchanged as it does not interact with `row`.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is defined independently of `row`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is used to define `i` and is not altered by the code.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `letters` is a non-empty string (two letters shorter).
- `row` is a list containing three elements, each being `letter`.
- `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both `row`.
- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string (two letters shorter), `row` is a list containing [letter, letter, letter], `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both [letter, letter, letter], `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**
