`selected_words` is assigned the value of `matrix[i][j]`. The value of `matrix[i][j]` is a character read from the `i`-th line of input, in the 3rd position (since `j` is 2). The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is 2; `m` is a positive integer greater than 0; `selected_words` is now equal to the character `matrix[i][j]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is 2; `m` is a positive integer greater than 0; `selected_words` is equal to the character `matrix[i][j]`.**
