Let's break down the given code snippet:

1. Initial State:
   - `letters` is an empty string: `letters = ''`
   - `row` is a list containing all the letters from `letters`: `row = ['']` (since `letters` is empty, `row` is a list with one empty string)
   - `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both `row`: `matrix = [[''], ['']]`
   - `i` is `n + len(letters)`: Since `len(letters)` is 0, `i = n + 0 = n`
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1: Let's denote `n` as `n` (we'll assume a specific value for demonstration purposes, say `n = 3`).

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   matrix.append(row)
   ```

   This line appends `row` to `matrix`. Since `row = ['']`, `matrix` will now look like this:
   ```
   matrix = [['', ''], ['', ''], ['', '']]
   ```

3. After the code execution, the following variables have been updated:
   - `matrix` now contains three rows, each being `['', '']`.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it was computed earlier and does not get modified in this line.

Output State: **`letters` is an empty string, `row` is [''], `matrix` is [['', ''], ['', ''], ['', '']], `i` is `n + 0 = n` where `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.**
