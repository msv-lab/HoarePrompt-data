`selected_words` is assigned the value of `selected_words + matrix[i][j]`. This means that `matrix[i][j]` is added to the existing value of `selected_words`. The condition `(not func_2(matrix, i, j))` is true for the current `i` and `j`, which means that `matrix[i][j]` is added to `selected_words`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-1`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]`.**
