The code `matrix[i][j] = '_'` updates the element at the position `(i, j)` in the `matrix` to the underscore character `'_'`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, `letter` is equal to `matrix[i][j]` and is now '_', and i, j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]).**
