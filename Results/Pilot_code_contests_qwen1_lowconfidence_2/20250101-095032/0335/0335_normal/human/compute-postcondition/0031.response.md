`row.append(letter)` adds the `letter` to the end of the list `row`. Since `row` was initially a list containing a single element `letter`, after appending `letter`, `row` will now contain two occurrences of `letter`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string (one letter shorter), `row` is a list containing [letter, letter], `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both `row`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**
