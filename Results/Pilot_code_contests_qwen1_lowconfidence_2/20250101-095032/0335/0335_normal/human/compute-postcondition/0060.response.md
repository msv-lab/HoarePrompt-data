Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`; `j` is `m`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Matrix**: The matrix remains unchanged because the loop only accesses and modifies the `selected_words` based on the condition inside the loop. The matrix itself does not undergo any changes.
2. **i**: The variable `i` is incremented within the loop, but the problem statement mentions that `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`. This implies that `i` starts at 0 and increments to `n - 1` over multiple iterations, ensuring the loop iterates through all rows of the matrix.
3. **j**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, so `j` starts at 0 and increments to `m - 1`. After all iterations, `j` will be `m - 1`.
4. **m**: The value of `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns in the matrix.
5. **selected_words**: For each column `j` in the matrix `i`-th row, if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character `matrix[i][j]` is appended to `selected_words`. Since the loop runs for all `j` from `0` to `m-1`, `selected_words` will contain all characters from the specified row where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is `False`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `selected_words` will contain all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.
