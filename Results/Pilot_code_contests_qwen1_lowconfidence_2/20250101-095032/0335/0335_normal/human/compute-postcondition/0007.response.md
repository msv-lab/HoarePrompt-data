The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `row` or `letter`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for these variables, we can only say that `letter` is appended to `row`.

Output State: **`row` is a list with `letter` appended to it, `letter` is its last element**
