`row` is a list with `letter` appended to it, meaning `row` contains `[letter]` and `letter` is the last element. The code `row.append(letter)` appends `letter` to the list `row`. Since `letter` is already the last element in `row`, appending `letter` to `row` will result in `row` containing `[letter, letter]`.

Output State: **`row` is `[letter, letter]`, `letter` is the second last and last element**
