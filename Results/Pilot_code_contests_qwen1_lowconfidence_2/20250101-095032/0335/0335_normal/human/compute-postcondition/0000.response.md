The code assigns the character at the position `(i, j)` in the `matrix` to the variable `letter`. This means `letter` now holds the value of `matrix[i][j]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, `letter` is equal to `matrix[i][j]`, and i, j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]).**
