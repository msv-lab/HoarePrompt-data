According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `letters`. For the loop to execute again, `letters` must still have at least one character remaining. At the end of the last iteration, `letters` must have had at least two characters, and `row` was updated to include the character added from the latest iteration.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider:
1. The number of characters left in `letters`.
2. The updated state of `row`.

Since `letters` must have at least two characters initially, and one character has already been processed (appended to `row`), `letters` must now have at least one character remaining for the loop to continue.

State: **`letters` must have at least one character, `row` is a list containing the original elements plus the character added from the latest iteration of appending `letter`.**
