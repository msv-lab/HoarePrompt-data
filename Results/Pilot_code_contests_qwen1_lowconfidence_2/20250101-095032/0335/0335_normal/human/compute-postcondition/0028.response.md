Let's break down the given information and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `letters` is the input string from the user.
- `row` is an empty list.
- `matrix` is a list containing two elements, and each element is the list `row`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

### For Loop:
```
for letter in letters:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for letter in letters:` will iterate over each character in the `letters` string.
   - For the loop to execute, `letters` must contain at least one character.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `letters` is the input string from the user (no specific value is provided initially).
   - `row` is an empty list.
   - `matrix` is a list containing two elements, and each element is the list `row`. This means `matrix` looks like `[[], []]`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore, `i` must be a number greater than 2 (since `n > 1`).

3. **States to Adjust**:
   - Since `letters` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `letters` to include at least one character.
   - `i` should be set to `n + 1` where `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. We can keep this as is since `n` is already specified to be a positive integer greater than 1.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is an empty list, `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both `row`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**.

This ensures that the loop will execute with at least one character in `letters`.
