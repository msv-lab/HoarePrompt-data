The code `row.append(letter)` appends the variable `letter` to the list `row`. This means that the list `row` will have one additional element, which is the value of `letter`. The state of `letters` remains unchanged since no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`letters` must have at least one character; `row` is a list containing the original elements plus the character added from the latest iteration of appending `letter`.**
