According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters.
- `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`.
- `j` is 1.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]` and has been updated to include `matrix[i][j]`. There is no change in the case where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns True.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `j`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `j = 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 1`; `j` is 2; `m` is a positive integer; if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns False, `selected_words` contains the character from `matrix[i][j]` and has been updated to include `matrix[i][j]`. There is no change in the case where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns True.**
