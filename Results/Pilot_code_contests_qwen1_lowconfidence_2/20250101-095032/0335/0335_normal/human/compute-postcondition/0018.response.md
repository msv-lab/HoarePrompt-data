The code `row.append(letter)` appends the value of `letter` to the list `row`. Since `letter` is a single character and must be present in the initial state, the length of `row` increases by one, adding the character `letter` to it. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`letters` must have at least one character, `row` is a list containing the original elements plus the character `letter`.**
