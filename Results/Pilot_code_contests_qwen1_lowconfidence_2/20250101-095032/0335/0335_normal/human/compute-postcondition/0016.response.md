The code initializes an empty list `row`. This affects the variable `row` by setting it to an empty list. The other variables (`letter`, `matrix`, `i`, `n`, and `letters`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`row` is an empty list, `letter` is the last letter in `letters`, `matrix` is a list containing `row`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `letters` is an input string from the user**
