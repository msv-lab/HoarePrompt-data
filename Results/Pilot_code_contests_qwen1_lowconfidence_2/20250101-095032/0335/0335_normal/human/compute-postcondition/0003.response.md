The code `matrix[i][j] = letter` assigns the value of `letter` (which is '_') to the element at position `[i][j]` in the `matrix`. The value of `letter` is specifically '_'. The `result` variable's value depends on whether '_' is present in the `i-th` row or the `j-th` column before this assignment. Since the initial state of `result` is determined by whether '_' is already in those positions, and the code only updates the matrix without affecting `result`, the value of `result` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`letter` is '_', `result` is True if '_' is present in the i-th row or the j-th column, otherwise `result` is False**
