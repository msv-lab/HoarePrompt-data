Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters.
   - `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`.
   - `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-2`.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]` (with the character `matrix[i][j]` duplicated) if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `True`, `selected_words` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `0` to `m-2`.
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m-1`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been less than `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range `0` to `m-2`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be updated to `j + 1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `matrix`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged since they are not modified inside the loop.
   - `selected_words` might change based on the value of `func_2(matrix, i, j)` for the new `j` value.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is updated to `j + 1` and must still be within the range `0` to `m-2`.
   - `selected_words` may or may not change depending on the value of `func_2(matrix, i, j + 1)`.

Therefore, the state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters; `i` is less than `n` and equals `i + 2`; `j` must be in the range `0` to `m-3`; `m` is a positive integer; `selected_words` now contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, plus the character `matrix[i][j]` (with the character `matrix[i][j]` duplicated) if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `True`, `selected_words` remains unchanged.**
