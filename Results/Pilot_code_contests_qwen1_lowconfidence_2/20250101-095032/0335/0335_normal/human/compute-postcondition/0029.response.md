The code `row.append(letter)` appends the variable `letter` to the list `row`. Since `letter` is a substring of the non-empty string `letters`, the list `row` will now contain this `letter`. The other variables are not affected.

- `matrix` is a list containing two elements, each of which is a list `row`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

After executing the code, `row` will have one more element, which is `letter`.

Output State: **`letters` is a non-empty string, `row` is a list containing `letter`, `matrix` is a list containing two elements which are both `row`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**
