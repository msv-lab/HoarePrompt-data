The code `selected_words += matrix[i][j]` adds the character at `matrix[i][j]` to the variable `selected_words`. The variable `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0. The state of `matrix`, `i`, and `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `selected_words` is the concatenation of its original value and the character at `matrix[i][1]`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0; `selected_words` is the original value of `selected_words` concatenated with `matrix[i][1]`.**
