Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is 1 (initially).
   - `m` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, `selected_words` is concatenated with `matrix[i][1]`. Otherwise, the value of `selected_words` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `m`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is 1 (initially, but it means we are at the first iteration of the loop).
   - `m` is a positive integer greater than 0.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 2.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j < m`.
   - Since `j` becomes 2 and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, the condition `j < m` will depend on the specific value of `m`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `matrix` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` remains less than `n` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `m` remains a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `selected_words` may or may not have been modified depending on the return value of `func_2(matrix, i, j)`. However, since we are only concerned with the next iteration, the state of `selected_words` does not change for the current step of adjustment.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` should be 2.
- `m` should still be a positive integer greater than 0.

So, the updated state is:
**State: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 2, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 0.**
