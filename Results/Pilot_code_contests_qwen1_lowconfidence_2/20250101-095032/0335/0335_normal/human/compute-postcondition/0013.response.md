The code `matrix.append(row)` appends the `row` list to the `matrix` list. Since `row` is a list containing all the letters in `letters`, and `letter` is the last letter in `letters`, the only change is that `matrix` now contains `row`.

Output State: **`row` is a list containing all the letters in `letters`, `letter` is the last letter in `letters`, `matrix` is a list containing `row`.**
