Postcondition: **`matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is 2; `m` is a positive integer greater than 0; if `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, then `selected_words` is equal to the character `matrix[i][j]`.**
