You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.

To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.

When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.

You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.

Output

Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.

Functions with output description for each function:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    (n, m) = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        row = []
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        matrix.append(row)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
    print(selected_words)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function processes a grid represented by a 2D list `matrix` of size `n x m`. For each character in the grid, it calls `func_2(matrix, i, j)` to determine whether to include the character in the final answer stored in `selected_words`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all characters, the function prints `selected_words`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is never called for certain positions due to logical errors or omissions, those characters might not be included in `selected_words`.
2. If `func_2` always returns `True`, then `selected_words` will be an empty string since no characters would be added.
3. The function assumes `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `matrix` is a valid 2D list. If these assumptions are violated, the behavior is undefined.
4. The function does not handle non-lowercase Latin letters in the grid, although the grid is specified to contain only such letters.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a crossword grid and two indices `i` and `j`. It checks whether the placeholder character `_` is present in the i-th row or the j-th column of the matrix. If `_` is found in either the specified row or column, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function temporarily replaces the character at position `(i, j)` with `_` to perform the check, but restores it before returning the result. Potential edge cases include when `i` or `j` are out of bounds of the matrix dimensions, although the code does not explicitly handle these cases, making them undefined behavior.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
