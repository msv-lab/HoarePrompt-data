Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the African crossword problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function checks for the presence of the letter in the row and column, but it does not account for the fact that a letter should only be crossed out if there is another identical letter in the same row or column. Instead, `func_2` returns `True` if the letter is found anywhere in the row or column, which means that a letter will always be removed if it is found even once in a row or column, regardless of whether there is another identical letter.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
aba
bab
aab
```

The expected output should be "ab", but the current implementation will incorrectly remove all 'a' and 'b' letters because it finds them in the same row or column, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the `func_2` function should check if there is another identical letter in the same row or column, not just if the letter is present.
