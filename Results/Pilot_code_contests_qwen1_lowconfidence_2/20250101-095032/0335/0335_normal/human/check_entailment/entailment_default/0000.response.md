Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to identify and remove repeated letters in rows and columns as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` is responsible for checking if a letter should be removed, but it does not properly handle this logic. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:** The function `func_2` checks if a letter is repeated in the same row or column by looking for the letter in the current row and the current column. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks if the letter appears anywhere in the row or column, not if it appears multiple times.

2. **Temporary Character Replacement:** The function replaces the character at position `(i, j)` with `_` to check for duplicates and then restores it. This replacement step is necessary but does not affect the logic for determining if a character is duplicated.

3. **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle the edge cases where the letter is repeated in the same row or column. For example, if a letter appears exactly twice in a row or column, the function incorrectly allows it to remain in the final word.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    # Check if the letter appears more than once in the row
    row_duplicates = matrix[i].count(letter) > 1
    # Check if the letter appears more than once in the column
    col_duplicates = sum(1 for k in range(len(matrix)) if matrix[k][j] == letter) > 1
    return not (row_duplicates or col_duplicates)

def func_1():
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    matrix = []
    for _ in range(n):
        matrix.append(list(input()))
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
    print(''.join(selected_words))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies and removes letters that appear more than once in their respective rows and columns, ensuring the program meets the problem description for every potential case.
