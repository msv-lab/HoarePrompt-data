You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.

To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.

When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.

You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.

Output

Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.

Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        row = []
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        matrix.append(row)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
    print(selected_words)

#Function 2:
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. Specifically, the function `func_2` checks if a letter is repeated in its row or column but does not handle the simultaneous removal of all such letters. Instead, it only checks and returns a boolean value without actually removing the letters from the matrix. 

For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 3
aaa
bbb
aaa
```

Expected output:
```
ab
```

However, the current implementation would not produce the correct output because it does not remove all occurrences of the letter 'a' from both the first and third rows. The output would be something like:
```
aa
bb
aa
```

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters simultaneously, leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, matrix is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the grid containing only lowercase Latin letters, and selected_words is an empty string initially used to accumulate the final answer.
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        
        row = []
        
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        
        matrix.append(row)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n` and equals `n - 1`, `j` is less than `m` and equals `m - 1`, `m` is a positive integer, `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.
    print(selected_words)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a grid represented by a 2D list `matrix` of size `n x m`. For each character in the grid, it calls `func_2(matrix, i, j)` to determine whether to include the character in the final answer stored in `selected_words`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all characters, the function prints `selected_words`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is never called for certain positions due to logical errors or omissions, those characters might not be included in `selected_words`.
2. If `func_2` always returns `True`, then `selected_words` will be an empty string since no characters would be added.
3. The function assumes `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `matrix` is a valid 2D list. If these assumptions are violated, the behavior is undefined.
4. The function does not handle non-lowercase Latin letters in the grid, although the grid is specified to contain only such letters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter, and i, j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]).
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result
    #The program returns result which is True if '_' is present in the i-th row or the j-th column, otherwise result is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a crossword grid and two indices `i` and `j`. It checks whether the placeholder character `_` is present in the i-th row or the j-th column of the matrix. If `_` is found in either the specified row or column, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function temporarily replaces the character at position `(i, j)` with `_` to perform the check, but restores it before returning the result. Potential edge cases include when `i` or `j` are out of bounds of the matrix dimensions, although the code does not explicitly handle these cases, making them undefined behavior.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
