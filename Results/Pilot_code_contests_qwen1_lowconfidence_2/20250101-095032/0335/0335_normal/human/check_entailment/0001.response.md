Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to remove repeated letters in rows and columns simultaneously. Specifically, the function `func_2` checks if a letter is repeated in its row or column but does not ensure that the letter is removed from both the row and column simultaneously when it is found to be repeated. Instead, it temporarily marks the letter with an underscore `_` and does not actually remove it from the matrix during the first pass through the grid. This means that the program will not correctly remove all repeated letters in the same pass, leading to an incorrect output.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
aaa
bbb
ccc
```

The expected output is "abc", but the current implementation will output "aaabbbccc" because it does not remove the repeated letters correctly.

To fix this, you would need to modify the program to ensure that letters are removed from both their row and column simultaneously. One way to achieve this is by maintaining a count of occurrences of each letter in each row and column, and then removing the letters that have a count greater than 1.
