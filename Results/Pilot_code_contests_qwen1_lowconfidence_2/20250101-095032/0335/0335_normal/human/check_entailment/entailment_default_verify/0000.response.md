Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_2` correctly checks if a letter is repeated in its row or column, but it does not actually remove the letters that are repeated. The main issue lies in how the program uses the result of `func_2` to build the final word. Since `func_2` only checks for repetition but does not remove the letters, the `selected_words` string will still include repeated letters, leading to incorrect output. 

For example, given the input:
```
3 3
aaa
bbb
aaa
```

The expected output is "ab", but the program will produce "aaabaa" because it does not remove the repeated 'a's. The function `func_2` is not designed to modify the matrix in place; instead, it should mark the positions to be removed and then filter out those positions after checking all letters. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
