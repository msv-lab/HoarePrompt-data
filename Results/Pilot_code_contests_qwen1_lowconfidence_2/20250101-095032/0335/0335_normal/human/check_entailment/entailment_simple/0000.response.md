Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \times m \) of the grid and the grid itself.
   - The grid is stored in a 2D list named `matrix`.

2. **Processing Each Cell:**
   - For each cell \((i, j)\) in the grid, the program checks if the letter at this position can be included in the final output string.
   - This check is performed by the function `func_2(matrix, i, j)`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` checks if the letter at \((i, j)\) appears again in the same row or the same column.
   - If the letter appears in either the row or the column, it means the letter should be removed (i.e., not included in the final output).
   - Otherwise, the letter is included in the final output string.

4. **Building the Output String:**
   - If a letter at position \((i, j)\) is not repeated in its row or column, it is added to the string `selected_words`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the string `selected_words`, which contains all unique letters in the grid, ordered by their position in the grid.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and performs the required operations correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
