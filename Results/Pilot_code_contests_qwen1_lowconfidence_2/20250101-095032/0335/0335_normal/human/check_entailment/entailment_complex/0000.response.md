Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where a character appears only once in its row or column. According to the problem description, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. However, the `func_2` function checks if the character is present in the row or column (including the character itself), which means it would incorrectly mark a character for removal even if it appears only once. This is evident from the following example:

### Example
Input:
```
3 3
aaa
bbb
ccc
```

Expected Output:
```
abc
```

However, the current implementation would output an empty string because every character appears only once in its respective row or column.

This issue arises because the condition `letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]` includes the character itself, meaning it will always return `True` for characters that appear only once. Therefore, the code fails to correctly identify and remove only the characters that are repeated in their rows or columns.
