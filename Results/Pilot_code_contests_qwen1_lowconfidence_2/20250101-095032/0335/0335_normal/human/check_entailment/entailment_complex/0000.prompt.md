You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An African crossword is a rectangular table n × m in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.

To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.

When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.

You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Next n lines contain m lowercase Latin letters each. That is the crossword grid.

Output

Print the encrypted word on a single line. It is guaranteed that the answer consists of at least one letter.

Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, matrix is a 2D list of strings where each string represents a row of the grid containing only lowercase Latin letters, and selected_words is an empty string initially used to accumulate the final answer.
def func_1():
    n, m = list(map(int, raw_input('').split()))
    matrix = []
    selected_words = ''
    for i in range(n):
        letters = raw_input('')
        
        row = []
        
        for letter in letters:
            row.append(letter)
        
        matrix.append(row)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if not func_2(matrix, i, j):
                selected_words += matrix[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `matrix` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of characters read from `n` lines of input, `i` is less than `n` and equals `n - 1`, `j` is less than `m` and equals `m - 1`, `m` is a positive integer, `selected_words` is a string that contains all characters from `matrix[i][j]` where `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returned `False` for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`.
    print(selected_words)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a grid represented by a 2D list `matrix` of size `n x m`. For each character in the grid, it calls `func_2(matrix, i, j)` to determine whether to include the character in the final answer stored in `selected_words`. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` returns `False`, the character at position `(i, j)` is added to `selected_words`. After processing all characters, the function prints `selected_words`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `func_2(matrix, i, j)` is never called for certain positions due to logical errors or omissions, those characters might not be included in `selected_words`.
2. If `func_2` always returns `True`, then `selected_words` will be an empty string since no characters would be added.
3. The function assumes `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `matrix` is a valid 2D list. If these assumptions are violated, the behavior is undefined.
4. The function does not handle non-lowercase Latin letters in the grid, although the grid is specified to contain only such letters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of characters representing the crossword grid, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter, and i, j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(matrix) and 0 <= j < len(matrix[0]).
def func_2(matrix, i, j):
    letter = matrix[i][j]
    matrix[i][j] = '_'
    result = letter in matrix[i] or letter in zip(*matrix)[j]
    matrix[i][j] = letter
    return result
    #The program returns result which is True if '_' is present in the i-th row or the j-th column, otherwise result is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a crossword grid and two indices `i` and `j`. It checks whether the placeholder character `_` is present in the i-th row or the j-th column of the matrix. If `_` is found in either the specified row or column, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function temporarily replaces the character at position `(i, j)` with `_` to perform the check, but restores it before returning the result. Potential edge cases include when `i` or `j` are out of bounds of the matrix dimensions, although the code does not explicitly handle these cases, making them undefined behavior.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
