Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. Specifically, the function `func_2` checks if a letter is repeated in its row or column but does not handle the simultaneous removal of all such letters. Instead, it only checks and returns a boolean value without actually removing the letters from the matrix. 

For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 3
aaa
bbb
aaa
```

Expected output:
```
ab
```

However, the current implementation would not produce the correct output because it does not remove all occurrences of the letter 'a' from both the first and third rows. The output would be something like:
```
aa
bb
aa
```

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic to cross out all repeated letters simultaneously, leading to incorrect results.
