The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` updates the output string with the formatted string using the absolute values of `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is within the range [0, n-2], `n` is the length of `xs`, `k` is 1 (since `k2` is 1 and no other value for `k` is provided, we assume `k` is `k2`), and the initial output string is `%s %s` % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)).

Let's break down the changes:

1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, but we substitute `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k` into the string formatting.
2. Since `k` is 1, the new output string will be `%s %s` % (abs(i + 1 + 1), abs(i + 2 + 1)), which simplifies to `%s %s` % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)).

Given the initial output string `%s %s` % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)), the updated output string will be the same because the expression used in the format string hasn't changed, only the indices have shifted by 1 due to the addition of `k`.

Therefore, the output string remains unchanged, and the values of other variables remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is within the range [0, n-2], `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is `%s %s` % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)).**
