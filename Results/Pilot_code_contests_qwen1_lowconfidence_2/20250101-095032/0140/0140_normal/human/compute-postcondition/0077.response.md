Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 1` if the loop executed `n - 2` times, or `n - 2` if the loop did not execute, and `n` is the length of `xs`. The function `w` is called with one of the following output strings: `'1 2'`, `'3 4'`, `'4 5'`, etc., based on the comparison in the loop.***
