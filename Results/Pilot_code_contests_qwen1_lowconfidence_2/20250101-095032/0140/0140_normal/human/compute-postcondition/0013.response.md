Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, index `i` is within the bounds of `xs` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 1. If `xs[i]` is greater than `xs[i + 1]`, then `k2` is increased by 1 and `k1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k2` remains unchanged and `k1` is the previous value of `k1` plus 1.***
