`k2` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The precondition that `i` is within the bounds of `xs` and equals `prev_i + 1` and `n` must be greater than `prev_i + 1` still holds. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `xs` and equals `prev_i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `prev_i + 1`, and `k2` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `xs` and equals `prev_i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `prev_i + 1`, and `k2` is increased by 1.**
