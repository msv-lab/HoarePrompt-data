The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately. This means that no further code will be executed, and all changes made during the execution of the current code block will not be applied. The values of the variables before the execution of `sys.exit()` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, the first element of `xs` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `xs`, and the call to `w` with the string `'%s %s' % (abs(1 + k), abs(n - 1 + k))` has been made.**
