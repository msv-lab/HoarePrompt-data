Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is `'1 2'`. If `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, the output string is updated to `'1 2'`.*** 

Explanation: Given the precondition and the fact that there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the initial precondition if the if condition is satisfied. The values of `total`, `xs`, `k2`, `k1`, `i`, `n`, and the output string are preserved as per the initial precondition since no operations are performed in the if or else parts other than potentially updating the output string, which does not affect the other variables.
