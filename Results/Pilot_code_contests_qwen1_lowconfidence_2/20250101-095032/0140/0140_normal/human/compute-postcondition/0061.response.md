Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop does not execute, or it is the index `i` where the loop exited, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the function `w` is called with one of the following output strings: `'1 2'`, `'3 4'`, `'4 5'`, etc., based on the comparison in the loop.***
