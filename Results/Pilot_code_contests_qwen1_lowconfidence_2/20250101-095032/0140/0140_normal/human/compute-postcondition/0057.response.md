The code snippet uses the `w` function to print the formatted string using the `abs` function on the expressions `i + 1 + k` and `i + 2 + k`. Given the initial state, let's calculate the values:

- `i` is 2
- `k` is 1 (since `k2` is 1 and `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` can be taken as 1)

So, the expressions become:
- `abs(i + 1 + k) = abs(2 + 1 + 1) = abs(4) = 4`
- `abs(i + 2 + k) = abs(2 + 2 + 1) = abs(5) = 5`

Therefore, the output string will be `'4 5'`.

The values of `total`, `xs`, `k2`, `k1`, `i`, `n`, and the output string remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is '4 5'**
