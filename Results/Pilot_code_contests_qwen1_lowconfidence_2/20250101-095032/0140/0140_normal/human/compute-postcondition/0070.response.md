The code `sys.exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. Since the program exits without further execution, no changes are made to the variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2**
