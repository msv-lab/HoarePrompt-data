Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` depending on whether the loop executes or not, `n` is the length of `xs`. The condition `k2 == 1` and `k1 >= 1` holds true, and the length of `xss` is less than `n`. If the condition `k2 >= 2` was not met or the loop did not execute, `k2` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to `n - 2`, and the function `w` is not called.***
