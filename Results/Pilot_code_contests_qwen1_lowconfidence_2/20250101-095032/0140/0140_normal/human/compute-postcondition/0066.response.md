The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately, which means no further code will be executed, and all local variables will be destroyed. Therefore, the values of the variables will not be updated or retained. The only information that remains from the precondition is that the condition `k2 == 1 and k1 == 0 and len(xs) >= 3` was true before the exit.

Output State: **the condition `k2 == 1 and k1 == 0 and len(xs) >= 3` was true**
