The `sys.exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. Since the program exits without further execution, no changes are made to any variables. The only information from the initial state that remains valid is the description of the preconditions.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is within the range [0, n-2], `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is `%s %s` % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)). The program has exited.**
