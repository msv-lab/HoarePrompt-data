Postcondition: **`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2, the function `w` will output a string based on the comparison logic inside the loop, and the condition `k2 == 1 and k1 == 0 and len(xs) >= 3` is true. Additionally, `i` is such that `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` holds true.**
