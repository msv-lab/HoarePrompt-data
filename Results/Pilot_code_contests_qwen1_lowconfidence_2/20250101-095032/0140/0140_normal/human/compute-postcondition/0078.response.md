Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 1` if the loop executed `n - 2` times, or `n - 2` if the loop did not execute, and `n` is the length of `xs`. The function `w` is called with one of the following output strings: `'1 2'`, `'3 4'`, `'4 5'`, etc., based on the comparison in the loop.***

Explanation: Since the if condition checks whether `k2` is equal to 0, and the given precondition already specifies that `k2` is initially 1, the only way to satisfy the if condition is by setting `k2` to 0. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged as per the precondition.
