Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether the loop executes or not, `n` is the length of `xs`. If `k2 >= 2` and the loop executes, `k2` is updated, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and the function `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` is called. If the condition `k2 >= 2` is not met or the loop does not execute, `k2` remains unchanged, `i` is set to `n - 2`, and the function `w` is not called.***
