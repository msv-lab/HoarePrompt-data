Let's go through this step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `xs` is a list of integers.
   - `k2` is 1.
   - `k1` is 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` is executed.
   - Here, `i` is `n - 1`, so `i + 1` is `n`, and `i + 2` is `n + 1`.
   - Since `k2` is 1 and `k1` is 0, the expressions inside `abs` become:
     - `abs(i + 1 + k2) = abs(n + 1 + 1) = abs(n + 2)`
     - `abs(i + 2 + k2) = abs(n + 1 + 1) = abs(n + 2)`
   - The function `w` prints the formatted string, which in this case will print `abs(n + 2) abs(n + 2)`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The values of `xs`, `k2`, `k1`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged because no assignment or modification was done to them.
   - The function `w` prints `abs(n + 2) abs(n + 2)`, but this does not change the state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2**.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2**.
