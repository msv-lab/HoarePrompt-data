The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `xs`, which is a list of integers, and `k`, which is an integer. However, the length of `xs` is constrained to be between 1 and \(10^5\). The function does not use the parameter `k` in its logic.

Based on the provided information, the function will either return an error message indicating that `k` is unused or it will simply return the list `xs` without any modification since no specific operation is described.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list `xs` of integers and return the list `xs` unchanged, while also noting that the parameter `k` is not used in the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `xs` of integers and returns the list `xs` unchanged, noting that the parameter `k` is unused.**
