The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately, which means no further code will be executed after this point. As a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is '4 5'**
