The code snippet `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` calls the function `w` with a formatted string. The values inside the string are determined by the expressions `abs(i + 1 + k)` and `abs(i + 2 + k)`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the length of `xs`

We need to evaluate the expressions within the function call:
- `i + 1 + k` evaluates to `(n - 1) + 1 + k` which simplifies to `n + k`
- `i + 2 + k` evaluates to `(n - 1) + 2 + k` which simplifies to `n + 1 + k`

Taking the absolute values of these expressions, we get:
- `abs(n + k)`
- `abs(n + 1 + k)`

Since the values of `n`, `i`, `k1`, `k2`, and `xs` are not altered by this function call, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, and the function `w` is called with arguments `abs(n + k)` and `abs(n + 1 + k)`.**
