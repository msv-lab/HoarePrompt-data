The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `k1`. The previous value of `k1` was undefined, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables (`k2`, `k`, and `xs`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`k2` is 0, `k` is an integer, `xs` is a list of integers representing the array with length n (1 <= n <= 10^5), `k1` is 0**
