The `sys.exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program and does not allow any further code execution or variable changes. All previously set states of the variables are preserved up until this point.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, prints "1 1"**
