`k1` is incremented by 1. The values of `xs`, `i`, `prev_i`, `n`, and `k2` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `xs` and equals `prev_i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `prev_i + 1`, and `k1` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `xs` and equals `prev_i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `prev_i + 1`, and `k1` is increased by 1.**
