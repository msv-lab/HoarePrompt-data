The `sys.exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately, without executing any further code. This means that none of the variables are modified by the subsequent lines of code. Therefore, the values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `i` is initialized to `n - 2`, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the program has exited.**
