`k2` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `k` remains unchanged, and the list `xs` remains as a list of integers. The length of `xs` is still between 1 and \(10^5\). Therefore, the Output State is: `k2` is 0, `k` is an integer (though its purpose is not clear from the function and seems to be unused in the logic provided), and `xs` is a list of integers representing the array with length n (1 <= n <= 10^5).

Output State: **`k2` is 0, `k` is an integer, `xs` is a list of integers representing the array with length n (1 <= n <= 10^5)**
