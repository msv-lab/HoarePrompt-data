Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step by step to determine the final state after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `xs` is a list of integers.
- `k2` is 0.
- `k1` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1` if the loop executed `n - 2` times, or `n - 2` if the loop did not execute.
- `n` is the length of `xs`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(0, n - 1, 1):
    if xs[0] != xs[i]:
        w('%s %s' % (abs(1 + k), abs(i + 1 + k)))
        sys.exit()
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices from `0` to `n - 2`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `xs[0]` is not equal to `xs[i]`.
   - If the condition is true, it calls the function `w` with the string `'%s %s' % (abs(1 + k), abs(i + 1 + k))` and exits the loop.

2. **Behavior of `i`**:
   - After the loop, `i` will either be `n - 1` (if the loop was executed) or `n - 2` (if the loop was not executed).

3. **Values of `k1` and `k2`**:
   - Since the function `w` is called and the loop exits, the values of `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged, i.e., both are still `0`.

### Final State:
- The loop will exit after the first condition where `xs[0]` is not equal to `xs[i]`.
- If such a condition is found, `i` will be set to the index where the mismatch is found.
- If no such condition is found, `i` will be `n - 1` (since the loop would not execute).

Given the behavior of the loop and the provided output states, we can summarize the final state as follows:

### Output State:
- `i` is `n - 1` if the loop did not execute, or the index where `xs[0]` is not equal to `xs[i]` if the loop executed.
- `n` is the length of `xs`.
- `k2` is 0.
- `k1` is 0.

Since the values of `k1` and `k2` do not change during the loop, they remain `0` regardless of whether the loop executes or not.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **`i` is `n - 1` if the loop did not execute, or the index where `xs[0]` is not equal to `xs[i]` if the loop executed, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0.**
