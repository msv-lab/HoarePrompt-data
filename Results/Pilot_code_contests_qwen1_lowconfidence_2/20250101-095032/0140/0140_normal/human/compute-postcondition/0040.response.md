The code `sys.exit()` is used to exit the program immediately, which means no further operations will be performed, and the current state of the variables will be retained. The variables `total`, `xs`, `k2`, `k1`, `i`, and the output string will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is within the range [0, n-2], `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is '%s %s' % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)).**
