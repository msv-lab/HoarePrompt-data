Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is within the range [0, n-2], `n` is the length of `xs`, and if `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, the output string is set to '%s %s' % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)). If `xs[i] >= xs[i + 1]`, no changes occur and the output string remains as '%s %s' % (abs(i + 2), abs(i + 3)). The program has exited.***
