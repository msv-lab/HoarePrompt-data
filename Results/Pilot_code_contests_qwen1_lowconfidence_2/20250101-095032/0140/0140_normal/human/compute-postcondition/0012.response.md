`k1` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs` is a list of integers, index `i` is within the bounds of `xs` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `k2` is increased by 1 if `xs[i]` is less than `xs[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `k2` remains unchanged; `k1` is the previous value of `k1` plus 1.
