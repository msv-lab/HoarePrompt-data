Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `i` is the last index accessed during the loop (equal to `n - 2`), `n` is the length of `xs`. The count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` is at least 2.***
