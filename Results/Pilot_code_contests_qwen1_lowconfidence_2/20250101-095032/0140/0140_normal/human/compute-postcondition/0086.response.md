The code `sys.exit()` terminates the program immediately, and no further code is executed after this statement. This means that none of the variables are updated or affected by any subsequent code.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `xs`.
- `k2` is 0.
- `k1` is 0.
- `w('%s %s' % (abs(1 + k), abs(i + 1 + k)))` is called with the values `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(i + 1 + k)`. Since `k` is not defined in the current scope, the values passed to `w` would be `abs(1 + 0)` and `abs((n - 1) + 1 + 0)`, which simplify to `1` and `n`, respectively. So, `w` is called with `1` and `n`.

Since the program exits immediately after calling `w`, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, `w` is called with `1` and `n`**
