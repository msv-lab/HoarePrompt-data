Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, and the function `w` is called with arguments `abs(n + k)` and `abs(n + 1 + k)`, regardless of whether `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` or not.***
