`k2` is incremented by 1. The value of `xs[i]` is less than the value of `xs[i + 1]`, and the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `xs`, `k2` is increased by 1, the current value of `xs[i]` is less than the value of `xs[i + 1]`.**
