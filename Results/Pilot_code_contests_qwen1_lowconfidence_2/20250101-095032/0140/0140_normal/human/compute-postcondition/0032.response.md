The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately, which means no further code is executed, and all variables retain their last known values before the exit. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, and the function `w` is called with arguments `abs(n + k)` and `abs(n + 1 + k)`**
