Functionality: **The function `func_3` takes a list `xs` of integers and an unused parameter `k`. It counts the number of adjacent pairs where the first element is less than (`k2`) or greater than (`k1`) the second element. Based on these counts and specific conditions, it calls the function `w` to print certain indices and then exits. The function does not modify the input list `xs`. The final state of the program is that `xs` remains unchanged, `k2` contains the count of ascending pairs, `k1` contains the count of descending pairs, `i` is the last index checked, and `n` is the length of `xs`. If the function `w` is called, it prints indices formatted as strings.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `xs` is a list with only one element, both `k2` and `k1` will be 0, and `i` will be 0.
- If no adjacent pair satisfies the conditions in any of the if blocks, `w` will not be called, and `i` will be `n - 2` or `n - 1` depending on which loop was not executed.
- The parameter `k` is not used in the function and can be considered redundant.
