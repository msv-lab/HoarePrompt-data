The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately without further execution of the remaining code. Since the program exits, no further changes to the variables occur. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is '3 4'.**
