The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to exit immediately without further execution of any subsequent lines of code. As a result, no new assignments or changes to the variables occur. The only information provided in the initial state is that `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2, and the printed output is `n + 1 n + 1`. However, since the program exits before reaching this print statement, these details are not reflected in the final state.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2**
