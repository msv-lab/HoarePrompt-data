The code `sys.exit()` will terminate the program immediately without further execution of any subsequent statements. Since the program exits, no variables are updated or affected by the code. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the output string is `'1 2'`.**
