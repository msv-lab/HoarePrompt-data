`sys.exit()` is called, which means the program will terminate immediately. Since the program exits, no further operations can be performed, and the values of the variables before the exit will remain unchanged. The states of the variables are as follows: `xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the function `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` has been executed.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the function `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k), abs(i + 2 + k)))` has been executed.**
