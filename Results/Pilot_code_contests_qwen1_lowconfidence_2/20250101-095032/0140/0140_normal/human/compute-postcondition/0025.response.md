Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is the count of indices where `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]`, `k1` is the count of indices where `xs[i] > xs[i + 1]`, `i` is initialized to `n - 2`, `n` is the length of `xs`, and the program has exited. If `xs[i] < xs[i + 1]` is true, then `k2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.***
