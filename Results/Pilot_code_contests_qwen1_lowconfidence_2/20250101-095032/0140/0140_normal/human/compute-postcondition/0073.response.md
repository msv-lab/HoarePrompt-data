The code snippet `w('%s %s' % (abs(i + 1 + k2), abs(i + 2 + k1)))` does not modify any variables directly but instead prints a formatted string using the values of `i`, `k2`, and `k1`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Calculate `i + 1 + k2`: Given `i` is `n - 1` and `k2` is 1, this evaluates to `(n - 1) + 1 + 1 = n + 1`.
2. Calculate `i + 2 + k1`: Given `i` is `n - 1` and `k1` is 0, this evaluates to `(n - 1) + 2 + 0 = n + 1`.
3. Take the absolute values of both results: Since `n + 1` is always positive (assuming `n` is greater than 2), the absolute values remain `n + 1`.

Therefore, the code will print `n + 1 n + 1`. The variables `i`, `k2`, `k1`, `xs`, and `n` are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`xs` is a list of integers, `k2` is 1, `k1` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs` and must be greater than 2, the printed output is `n + 1 n + 1`.**
