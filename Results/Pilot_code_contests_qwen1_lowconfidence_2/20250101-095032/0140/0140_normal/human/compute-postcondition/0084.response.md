Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` is the length of `xs`
- `k2` is 0
- `k1` is 0

### For Loop:
```
for i in xrange(0, n - 1, 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop starts from `0` and increments `i` until `i` reaches `n - 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if `i < n - 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - So, `i` will become `n - 1`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - When `i` becomes `n - 1`, the loop condition `i < n - 1` will fail because `n - 1 < n - 1` is false.
   - Thus, the loop will terminate.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop will terminate in the next iteration, we need to adjust the state accordingly.
   - `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same, as it is the length of `xs`.
   - `k2` and `k1` remain unchanged since there is no information suggesting they should change based on the loop itself.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the length of `xs`
- `k2` is 0
- `k1` is 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the final state before the loop termination) is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0**
