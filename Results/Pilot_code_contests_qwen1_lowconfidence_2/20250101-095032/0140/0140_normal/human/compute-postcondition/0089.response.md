The code snippet `w('%s %s' % (abs(1 + k), abs(i + 1 + k)))` does the following:

1. It calculates `abs(1 + k)` which is `abs(1 + 0)` since `k` is `0`.
2. It calculates `abs(i + 1 + k)` which is `abs(-1 + 1 + 0)` since `i` is `n - 1` and `k` is `0`.
3. It prints the result in the format `%s %s`.

Since `k` is `0`, both `abs(1 + k)` and `abs(i + 1 + k)` simplify to `1` and `0` respectively. So the code effectively prints "1 1". 

No variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the only changes are the printed values.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `xs`, `k2` is 0, `k1` is 0, prints "1 1"**
