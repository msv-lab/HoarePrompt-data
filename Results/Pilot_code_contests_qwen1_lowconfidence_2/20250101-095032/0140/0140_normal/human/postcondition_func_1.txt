The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a function `f`. It reads `t` lines from an input source, where each line is a space-separated list of non-negative integers. For each line, it splits the line into a list of integers. If the function `f` is provided (`f` is not `None`), it applies `f` to each integer in the list and converts the result back into a list or tuple (depending on whether `f` returns a single value or a tuple). Otherwise, it simply converts the split line into a list of integers. The function then collects these results into a list called `result` and returns it. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` contains a list of either tuples or lists, depending on whether `f` was applied.
