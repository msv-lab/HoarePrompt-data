The function `func_3` takes a list `xs` of integers and an unused parameter `k`. It counts the number of adjacent pairs where the first element is less than (`k2`) or greater than (`k1`) the second element. Based on these counts and specific conditions, it calls the function `w` to print certain indices and then exits. The function does not modify the input list `xs`. The final state of the program is that `xs` remains unchanged, `k2` contains the count of ascending pairs, `k1` contains the count of descending pairs, `i` is the last index checked, and `n` is the length of `xs`. If the function `w` is called, it prints indices formatted as strings.
