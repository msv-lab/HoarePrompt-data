You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the logic for identifying and swapping two elements to make the array unsorted correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not properly check for the conditions under which swapping two elements can make the array unsorted. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The variables `k1` and `k2` are used to count the number of increasing and decreasing sequences, but the logic to determine if swapping can make the array unsorted is flawed.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function attempts to print indices for swapping but does not ensure that the swap will actually make the array unsorted. The function `w` is used to print the indices, but it is not defined in the provided code.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays that are already sorted in both ascending and descending order, or arrays with repeated elements that do not affect the sorting.

Here’s a more appropriate way to solve the problem:

```python
def can_swap_to_unsort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return -1
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order
    non_decreasing = all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-increasing order
    non_increasing = all(arr[i] >= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    if non_decreasing or non_increasing:
        # Find the first position where the sequence breaks
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
                # Find the next position where the sequence breaks in reverse
                for j in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
                    if arr[j] < arr[j - 1]:
                        return i + 1, j + 1
        return -1
    else:
        return -1

# Example usage
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = can_swap_to_unsort(arr)
print(result)
```

This approach correctly identifies the first and last positions where the array deviates from being sorted in either direction, ensuring that swapping these elements will unsort the array.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes a list `xs` of integers and an unused parameter `k`. It counts the number of adjacent pairs where the first element is less than (`k2`) or greater than (`k1`) the second element. Based on these counts and specific conditions, it calls the function `w` to print certain indices and then exits. The function does not modify the input list `xs`. The final state of the program is that `xs` remains unchanged, `k2` contains the count of ascending pairs, `k1` contains the count of descending pairs, `i` is the last index checked, and `n` is the length of `xs`. If the function `w` is called, it prints indices formatted as strings.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
