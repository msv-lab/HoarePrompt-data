You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

Function number 1 :
 Code:

def func_1(f=None):
    if f:
        return map(f, read().split())
    else:
        return read().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`, which is a function that converts strings to integers. It reads a string of space-separated integers using the `read()` function. Depending on whether `f` is provided, the function returns either a map object applying `f` to each integer in the list of integers or a list of integers directly obtained by splitting the string returned by `read()`.

In both cases, the final state of the program after the function concludes is:
- If `f` is provided and is a valid function, the program returns a map object where `f` is applied to each integer in the list of integers.
- If `f` is not provided or is not a valid function, the program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `read()`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the function returns a map object when `f` is provided. However, the function does not check if `f` is a valid callable function. If `f` is not callable, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- The function does not handle cases where `read()` returns an empty string. In such cases, the returned map object (in Case 1) would be empty, and the returned list (in Case 2) would also be empty.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(t, f=None):
    result = []
    result_append = result.append
    for i in xrange(t):
        if f:
            result_append(tuple(map(f, read().split())))
        else:
            result_append(list(read().split()))
    return result
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a function `f`. It reads `t` lines from an input source, where each line is a space-separated list of non-negative integers. For each line, it splits the line into a list of integers. If the function `f` is provided (`f` is not `None`), it applies `f` to each integer in the list and converts the result back into a list or tuple (depending on whether `f` returns a single value or a tuple). Otherwise, it simply converts the split line into a list of integers. The function then collects these results into a list called `result` and returns it. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` contains a list of either tuples or lists, depending on whether `f` was applied.

''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes a list `xs` of integers and an unused parameter `k`. It counts the number of adjacent pairs where the first element is less than (`k2`) or greater than (`k1`) the second element. Based on these counts and specific conditions, it calls the function `w` to print certain indices and then exits. The function does not modify the input list `xs`. The final state of the program is that `xs` remains unchanged, `k2` contains the count of ascending pairs, `k1` contains the count of descending pairs, `i` is the last index checked, and `n` is the length of `xs`. If the function `w` is called, it prints indices formatted as strings.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
