Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not handle the case where the array has exactly two elements that are out of order in a way that swapping them would make the array unsorted. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function `func_3` does not handle the case where the array has exactly two elements that are out of order. For example, if the input is `[1, 3, 2]`, the function should identify the indices `1` and `2` to be swapped to make the array unsorted. However, the current implementation does not cover this scenario properly.

2. **Logic Issues**: The conditions in `func_3` do not cover all possible ways to identify two indices that can be swapped to make the array unsorted. The conditions only check for specific patterns of increasing and decreasing sequences but do not account for more complex cases where only two elements need to be swapped.

Here is a concrete example that the current code fails to handle correctly:

- **Input**: `[1, 3, 2]`
- **Expected Output**: `1 2` (Swap elements at indices 1 and 2 to make the array unsorted: `[3, 1, 2]`)
- **Actual Output**: `-1` (The current code does not identify the correct indices to swap)

Since the code does not handle this edge case and similar cases where only two elements need to be swapped to make the array unsorted, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.
