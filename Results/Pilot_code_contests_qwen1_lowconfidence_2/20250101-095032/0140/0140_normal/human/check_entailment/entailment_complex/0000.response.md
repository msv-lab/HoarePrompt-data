Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where all elements in the array are the same but the array length is greater than 3. According to the problem description, the program should return `-1` in such cases because no two distinct integers can be swapped to make the array unsorted. However, the code incorrectly handles this case as follows:

1. In the function `func_1`, there is no validation to check if `f` is a callable function. If `f` is not provided or not callable, the code may fail or behave unpredictably.
2. In the main part of the code, the logic checks if the set of elements `xss` has only one unique element. If `len(xss) == 1`, the code incorrectly prints `-1` and exits. This means that the code does not correctly identify the case where all elements are the same but the array length is greater than 3, and thus fails to return `-1` in such cases.

To fix this, the code should check if the length of the array is greater than 3 and all elements are the same before printing `-1`. Here is a modified version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
if n > 3 and len(set(xs)) == 1:
    w('-1')
    sys.exit()
```

This ensures that the code correctly handles the case where all elements are the same and the array length is greater than 3, as specified in the problem description.
