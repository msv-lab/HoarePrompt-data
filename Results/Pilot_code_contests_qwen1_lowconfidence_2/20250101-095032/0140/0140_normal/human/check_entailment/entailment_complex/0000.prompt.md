You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya likes arrays of integers a lot. Recently his mother has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya is now wondering whether he can swap any two distinct integers in the array so that the array got unsorted. Please note that Petya can not swap equal integers even if they are in distinct positions in the array. Also note that Petya must swap some two integers even if the original array meets all requirements.

Array a (the array elements are indexed from 1) consisting of n elements is called sorted if it meets at least one of the following two conditions:

  1. a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an; 
  2. a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. 



Help Petya find the two required positions to swap or else say that they do not exist.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n non-negative space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — the elements of the array that Petya's mother presented him. All integers in the input do not exceed 109.

Output

If there is a pair of positions that make the array unsorted if swapped, then print the numbers of these positions separated by a space. If there are several pairs of positions, print any of them. If such pair does not exist, print -1. The positions in the array are numbered with integers from 1 to n.

Examples

Input

1
1


Output

-1


Input

2
1 2


Output

-1


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

1 2


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first two samples the required pairs obviously don't exist.

In the third sample you can swap the first two elements. After that the array will look like this: 2 1 3 4. This array is unsorted.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: read() is a function that returns a string containing space-separated integers, and f is a function that converts strings to integers. The returned value should be a list of integers representing the array elements.
def func_1(f):
    if f :
        return map(f, read().split())
        #The program returns a map object that applies function f to each integer in the list of integers returned by read(). The read() function returns a string of space-separated integers, which is then split into a list of strings, and function f is applied to each element of this list to convert them to integers.
    else :
        return read().split()
        #`The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by the function read()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `f`, which is a function that converts strings to integers. It reads a string of space-separated integers using the `read()` function. Depending on whether `f` is provided, the function returns either a map object applying `f` to each integer in the list of integers or a list of integers directly obtained by splitting the string returned by `read()`.

In both cases, the final state of the program after the function concludes is:
- If `f` is provided and is a valid function, the program returns a map object where `f` is applied to each integer in the list of integers.
- If `f` is not provided or is not a valid function, the program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `read()`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the function returns a map object when `f` is provided. However, the function does not check if `f` is a valid callable function. If `f` is not callable, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- The function does not handle cases where `read()` returns an empty string. In such cases, the returned map object (in Case 1) would be empty, and the returned list (in Case 2) would also be empty.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of lines to read, and each line is a space-separated list of non-negative integers. The length of each list does not exceed 10^5 and all integers in the list do not exceed 10^9.
def func_2(t, f):
    result = []
    result_append = result.append
    for i in xrange(t):
        if f:
            result_append(tuple(map(f, read().split())))
        else:
            result_append(list(read().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `result` is a list of elements where each element is either a tuple resulting from applying `f` to the split input or a list resulting from splitting the input without applying `f`.
    return result
    #`The program returns the list 'result' which contains elements where each element is either a tuple resulting from applying function f to the split input or a list resulting from splitting the input without applying f, given that 't' is a positive integer and 'i' is 't-1'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a function `f`. It reads `t` lines from an input source, where each line is a space-separated list of non-negative integers. For each line, it splits the line into a list of integers. If the function `f` is provided (`f` is not `None`), it applies `f` to each integer in the list and converts the result back into a list or tuple (depending on whether `f` returns a single value or a tuple). Otherwise, it simply converts the split line into a list of integers. The function then collects these results into a list called `result` and returns it. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` contains a list of either tuples or lists, depending on whether `f` was applied.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: xs is a list of integers representing the array with length n (1 <= n <= 10^5), and k is an integer (though its purpose is not clear from the function and seems to be unused in the logic provided).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a list `xs` of integers and an unused parameter `k`. It counts the number of adjacent pairs where the first element is less than (`k2`) or greater than (`k1`) the second element. Based on these counts and specific conditions, it calls the function `w` to print certain indices and then exits. The function does not modify the input list `xs`. The final state of the program is that `xs` remains unchanged, `k2` contains the count of ascending pairs, `k1` contains the count of descending pairs, `i` is the last index checked, and `n` is the length of `xs`. If the function `w` is called, it prints indices formatted as strings.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
