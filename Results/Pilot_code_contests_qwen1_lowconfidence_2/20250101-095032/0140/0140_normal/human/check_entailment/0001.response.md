Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Increasing and Decreasing Sequences**:
   - The logic for checking increasing and decreasing sequences is flawed. For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. The program should identify that swapping positions 1 and 2 would make the array unsorted. However, the current logic might miss this case.

2. **Unnecessary Complexity**:
   - The nested loops and conditional checks are overly complex and might not cover all edge cases. For instance, the program might fail to handle cases where the array is already sorted in a way that requires specific swaps to become unsorted.

3. **Potential Missed Swaps**:
   - The current implementation might miss certain valid swaps. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, swapping positions 1 and 2 would make the array unsorted, but the program might not identify this due to the current logic.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the array `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. Here, swapping positions 1 and 2 would make the array unsorted. However, the current implementation might not detect this case correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description.
