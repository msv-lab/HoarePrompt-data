Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the logic for identifying and swapping two elements to make the array unsorted correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not properly check for the conditions under which swapping two elements can make the array unsorted. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The variables `k1` and `k2` are used to count the number of increasing and decreasing sequences, but the logic to determine if swapping can make the array unsorted is flawed.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function attempts to print indices for swapping but does not ensure that the swap will actually make the array unsorted. The function `w` is used to print the indices, but it is not defined in the provided code.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays that are already sorted in both ascending and descending order, or arrays with repeated elements that do not affect the sorting.

Hereâ€™s a more appropriate way to solve the problem:

```python
def can_swap_to_unsort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return -1
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order
    non_decreasing = all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-increasing order
    non_increasing = all(arr[i] >= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
    
    if non_decreasing or non_increasing:
        # Find the first position where the sequence breaks
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
                # Find the next position where the sequence breaks in reverse
                for j in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
                    if arr[j] < arr[j - 1]:
                        return i + 1, j + 1
        return -1
    else:
        return -1

# Example usage
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = can_swap_to_unsort(arr)
print(result)
```

This approach correctly identifies the first and last positions where the array deviates from being sorted in either direction, ensuring that swapping these elements will unsort the array.
