Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in a way that no two distinct integers can be swapped to make it unsorted. Specifically, the code does not consider the case where the array is sorted in a non-trivial manner (neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing). The code checks for the presence of at least one pair of elements that are not in the correct order to determine if a swap is possible. However, if the array is sorted in a trivial manner (all elements are the same or the array is already sorted in a non-trivial manner), the code will incorrectly exit without providing a solution.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 2, 3]`. This array is sorted in a non-trivial manner and can be made unsorted by swapping the second and third elements. However, the provided code will not identify this possibility and instead will exit with `-1`.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the array has exactly three elements and the first and third elements are the same. This case is explicitly handled with a separate condition in the code, but it is unclear if this is the only such case that needs special handling. The general logic of the code does not cover all potential scenarios where a swap could potentially unsort the array.
