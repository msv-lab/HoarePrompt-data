The code snippet `range, input = xrange, raw_input` reassigns the `range` and `input` variables to refer to `xrange` and `raw_input` respectively. The initial values of `n` and `xi` remain unchanged, and the value of `sys.version[0]` also remains '2'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `xi` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ xi ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and xi ≠ xj for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≠ j; range refers to `xrange`, input refers to `raw_input`; the current value of `sys.version[0]` is '2'**
