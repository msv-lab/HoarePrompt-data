Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `xi` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ xi ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and xi ≠ xj for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ≠ j; the current value of `sys.version[0]` remains unchanged (as no modifications are made to the variables within the if or else blocks).**
