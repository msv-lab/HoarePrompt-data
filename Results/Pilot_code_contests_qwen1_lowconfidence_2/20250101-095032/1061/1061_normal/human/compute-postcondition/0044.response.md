The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems that the parameters `K` and `S` are relevant to the function's behavior, even though they are not explicitly mentioned in the function definition.

- `K` is an integer such that \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\).
- `S` is an integer such that \(0 \leq S \leq 3K\).

Given the output cases provided, we can infer that the function likely uses these parameters internally, but since they are not passed as arguments to the function, we focus on the constraints and the possible return values.

Case_1: The function returns an error message indicating that `K` is out of its valid range (i.e., either less than 2 or greater than 2500).
Case_2: The function returns an error message indicating that `S` is out of its valid range (i.e., either less than 0 or greater than \(3K\)).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle and validate the internal parameters `K` and `S` based on their constraints and return appropriate messages if they are out of the specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but internally validates the parameters `K` and `S` against the constraints \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\) and \(0 \leq S \leq 3K\). If `K` is out of range, it returns an error message; if `S` is out of range, it returns another error message.**
