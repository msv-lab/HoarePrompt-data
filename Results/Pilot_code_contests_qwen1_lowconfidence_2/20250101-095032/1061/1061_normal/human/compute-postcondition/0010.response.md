The value of `ct` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ct` was `ct + 1`, so the new value of `ct` is now `(ct + 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the same, `s` is the same, `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is `(ct + 1) + 1`, `x` is 0, `nokori` is `s - 1`.**
