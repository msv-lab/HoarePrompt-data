`ct` is incremented by 1, which means the number of valid `y` values that satisfy \(0 \leq s - y \leq k\) plus 1 has increased by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is the number of valid `y` values that satisfy \(0 \leq s - y \leq k\) plus 1 increased by 1, `x` is 0, `nokori` is `s - y_current` if the condition \(0 \leq s - y_current - (y_current + 1) \leq k\) holds, otherwise `nokori` is `s`.**
