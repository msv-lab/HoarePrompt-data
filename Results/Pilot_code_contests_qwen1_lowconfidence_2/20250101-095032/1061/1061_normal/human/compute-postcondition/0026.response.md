`ct` is incremented by 1. The value of `ct` was originally 2, so now `ct` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), \( s \) is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is 3, `x` is \(k + 1\), `nokori` is \(s - (k + 1) - (y_{prev} + 1) - 1\).

Output State: **`k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), \( s \) is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is 3, `x` is \(k + 1\), `nokori` is \(s - (k + 1) - (y_{prev} + 1) - 1\)**
