`ct` is incremented by 1, so the value of `ct` becomes the original value of `ct` plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is `ct + 1`, `x` is 0, `nokori` is `s`, and \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\).

Output State: **`k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is `ct + 1`, `x` is 0, `nokori` is `s`, and \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\)**
