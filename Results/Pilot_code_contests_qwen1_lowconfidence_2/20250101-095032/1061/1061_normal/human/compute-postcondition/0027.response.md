Postcondition: **`k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), \( s \) is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is 3, `x` is \(k + 1\), `nokori` is \(s - (k + 1) - (y_{prev} + 1) - 1\). If \(0 \leq \text{nokori} - y \leq k\), then `ct` is increased by 1.**
