`ct` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ct` and retains the original values of `k`, `s`, `patterns`, `x`, and `nokori`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is 2, `x` is \(k + 1\), `nokori` is \(s - (k + 1) - y - 1\)**
