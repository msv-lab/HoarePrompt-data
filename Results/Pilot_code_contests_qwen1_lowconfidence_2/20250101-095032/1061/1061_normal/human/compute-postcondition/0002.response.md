`ct` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `k` and `s` are read from input, and `patterns` is an empty list. After executing the line `ct = 0`, the value of `ct` is 0, while the values of `k`, `s`, and `patterns` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer read from input such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\); `s` is an integer read from input such that \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\); `patterns` is an empty list; `ct` is 0**
