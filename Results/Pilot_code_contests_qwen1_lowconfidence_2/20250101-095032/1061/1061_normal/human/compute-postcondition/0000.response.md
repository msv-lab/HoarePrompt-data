The code `k, s = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from input, splits them by whitespace, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `k` and `s` respectively. Given the initial conditions:

- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\)
- `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\)

After executing the code, the values of `k` and `s` will be the integers read from the input. The initial conditions remain valid, meaning `k` still satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\) and `s` still satisfies \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\).

Output State: **`k` is an integer read from input such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\); `s` is an integer read from input such that \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\)**
