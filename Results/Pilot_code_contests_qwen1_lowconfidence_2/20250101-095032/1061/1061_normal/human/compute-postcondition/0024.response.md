Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is 2, `x` is \(k + 1\), `nokori` is \(s - (k + 1) - y - 1\). If \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) holds true, then the condition is met. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
