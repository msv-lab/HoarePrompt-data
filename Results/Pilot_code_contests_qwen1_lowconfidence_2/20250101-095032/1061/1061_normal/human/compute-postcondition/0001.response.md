The code initializes an empty list called `patterns`. This does not change the values of `k` or `s`, but it does set the value of `patterns` to an empty list. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is an integer read from input such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\); `s` is an integer read from input such that \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\); `patterns` is an empty list**
