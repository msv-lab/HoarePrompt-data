Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is the number of valid `y` values that satisfy \(0 \leq s - y \leq k\) plus 1, `x` is 0, `nokori` is `s`, and there must exist at least one `y` in the range \([0, k]\) such that \(0 \leq s - y \leq k\). If the condition \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) holds, `ct` is incremented by 1.***
