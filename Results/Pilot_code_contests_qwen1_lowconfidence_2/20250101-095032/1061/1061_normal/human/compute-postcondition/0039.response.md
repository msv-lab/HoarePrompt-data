`ct` is incremented by 1, meaning `ct` increases by 1 from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is the number of valid `y` values that satisfy \(0 \leq s - y \leq k\) plus 1 (increased by 1), `x` is 0, `nokori` is either `s - (y_current + 1)` if the condition \(0 \leq s - (y_current + 1) - ((y_current + 1) + 1) \leq k\) holds or `s`.
