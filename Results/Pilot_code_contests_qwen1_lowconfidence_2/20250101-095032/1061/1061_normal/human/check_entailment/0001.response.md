Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle the case when `s` is greater than `3 * k`. According to the problem description, the maximum value of `s` is `3 * k`, but the program does not include this constraint. For example, if `k = 2` and `s = 4`, the program will still run and produce a result, but the expected output should be `0` because there are no values of `x`, `y`, and `z` within the given constraints that satisfy `x + y + z = 4`.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `s` does not exceed `3 * k`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (k, s) = map(int, input().split())
    if s > 3 * k:
        print(0)
        return
    patterns = []
    ct = 0
    for x in range(k + 1):
        nokori = s - x
        for y in range(k + 1):
            if 0 <= nokori - y <= k:
                ct += 1
    print(ct)

func()
```

With this addition, the program correctly handles the constraint `0 ≤ s ≤ 3 * k`.
