You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two integers K and S.
Three variable X, Y and Z takes integer values satisfying 0≤X,Y,Z≤K.
How many different assignments of values to X, Y and Z are there such that X + Y + Z = S?

Constraints

* 2≤K≤2500
* 0≤S≤3K
* K and S are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


K S


Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: K is an integer such that 2 ≤ K ≤ 2500, and S is an integer such that 0 ≤ S ≤ 3K.
def func():
    k, s = map(int, raw_input().split())
    patterns = []
    ct = 0
    for x in range(k + 1):
        nokori = s - x
        
        for y in range(k + 1):
            if 0 <= nokori - y <= k:
                ct += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq k \leq 2500\), `s` is an integer within the range \(0 \leq s \leq 3k\), `patterns` is an empty list, `ct` is the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs that satisfy \(0 \leq s - x - y \leq k\) over all iterations of the loop, `x` is `k + 1`, and `nokori` is `s - ct \cdot (k + 1)`
    print(ct)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads two integers `K` and `S` from standard input, where \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\) and \(0 \leq S \leq 3K\). It then iterates through all possible pairs \((x, y)\) where \(0 \leq x \leq K\) and \(0 \leq y \leq K\), counting the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the condition \(0 \leq S - x - y \leq k\). After completing the iteration, it prints the count of valid pairs. If `K` is out of range, the function does not handle this case explicitly and may raise an error when converting input. Similarly, if `S` is out of range, the function also does not handle this case explicitly and may raise an error when converting input. The final state of the program is that the variable `ct` contains the count of valid pairs, which is printed to the console.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
