The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\)
- `i`: an integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq 10^8\)
- `ca`: a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values
- `md`: an integer calculated as the smallest power of 2 such that the number of distinct values \(K\) is less than or equal to \(2^{md}\), determined by the formula \(md = 2^{8 \cdot i / n}\)
- `pref`: a prefix sum list of the frequencies of the unique integers
- `s`: the initial count of the minimum number of changes needed, initialized to \(n\)

The function does not directly return a value but calls another function `func_2(s)` at the end, setting `s` to 0 if the range end is less than or equal to 0. The value returned by `func_2(s)` is the output of `func_1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `i`, `ca`, `md`, `pref`, and `s`. It calculates the minimum number of changes needed using a specific algorithm involving a prefix sum list and updates `s` accordingly. Finally, it returns the result of calling `func_2(s)` where `s` is set to 0 if the range end is less than or equal to 0.**
