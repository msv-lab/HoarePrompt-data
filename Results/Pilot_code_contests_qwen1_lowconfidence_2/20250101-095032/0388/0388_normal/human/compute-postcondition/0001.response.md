The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` affects the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the `'sep'` and `'file'` keys and assigning their values to `sep` and `file`, respectively. If `'sep'` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space (' '), and if `'file'` is not provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

After this operation, the values of `n`, `I`, and `a` remain unchanged, but `sep` and `file` are now defined.

Output State: **`n` remains in its initial state, `I` remains in its initial state, `a` remains in its initial state, `sep` is either ' ' or the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it was provided, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or the value of `kwargs['file']` if it was provided.**
