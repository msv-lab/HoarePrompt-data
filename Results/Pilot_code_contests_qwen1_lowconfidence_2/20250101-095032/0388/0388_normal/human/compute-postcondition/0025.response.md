Functionality: **The function `func_2()` accepts variable arguments (`*args`), keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), and prints them to a specified file object. It supports optional parameters such as `sep` (separator between items), `file` (output file, defaults to `sys.stdout`), `end` (string appended after the last item, defaults to newline), and `flush` (whether to forcibly flush the fileâ€™s output buffer). After executing, the function appends the string representations of all items in `args`, separated by `sep`, and ends with the value of `end`. If `flush` is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer immediately. If `kwargs` contains the key `'end'`, it is removed from `kwargs` after use. The function does not return anything and modifies the `file` object in place.**

Potential edge cases:
- If `file` is not a valid file object, the behavior is undefined.
- If `flush` is `True` and `file` does not support flushing, an error may occur.
- If `sep` is not a string, it will still be written as is, which might not be the intended behavior.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not check if `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush` are provided correctly or are of the expected type.
