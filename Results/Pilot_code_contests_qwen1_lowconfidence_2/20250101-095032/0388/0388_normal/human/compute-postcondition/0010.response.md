`file.write(sep)` writes the string `sep` to the file. The variable `sep` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. However, the operation of writing to the file does not affect the values of `args`, `at_start`, or the content of `file` other than appending `sep` to it.

Output State: **`args` contains at least two elements; `at_start` is `False`; `file` now contains the original content plus the string representations of `x` and the next element in `args`, followed by `sep`.**
