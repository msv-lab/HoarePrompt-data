`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The value of `x` is not specified, but it will be converted to a string and appended to the file. The values of `args`, `at_start`, and `sep` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`args` contains at least three elements, `at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of the current `x`, followed by the string representation of the next element in `args`, followed by `sep`, and `sep` has been written to the file, and the string representation of `x` has been written to the file.**
