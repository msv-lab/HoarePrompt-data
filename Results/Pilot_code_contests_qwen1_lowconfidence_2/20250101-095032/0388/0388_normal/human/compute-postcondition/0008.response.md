The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. This changes the value of `at_start` from whatever its previous value was (which was `False` according to the condition given) to explicitly `False`. The other variables (`args`, `file`, `sep`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`args` contains at least one element; `at_start` is `False`; `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of `x`.**
