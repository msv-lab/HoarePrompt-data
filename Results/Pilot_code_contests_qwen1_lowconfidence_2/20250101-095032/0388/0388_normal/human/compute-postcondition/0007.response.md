`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since `x` is a variable, its value will be converted to a string and appended to the file. The state of `args`, `at_start`, and `file` (except for the part where `sep` is written, which is not relevant here) remain unchanged. Therefore, the only affected variable is `file`, which now contains the original content plus the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`args` contains at least one element; if `at_start` is false, then `file` has `sep` written to it; `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of `x`.**
