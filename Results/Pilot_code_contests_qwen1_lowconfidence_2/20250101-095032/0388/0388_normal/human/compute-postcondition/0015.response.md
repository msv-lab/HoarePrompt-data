The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. This operation does not change the value of `sep` or any other variables apart from appending `sep` to the file content. The variables `args`, `at_start`, and the content of `file` are not directly modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`args` contains at least three elements, `at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of the current `x`, followed by the string representation of the next element in `args`, followed by `sep`, and `sep` has been written to the file.**
