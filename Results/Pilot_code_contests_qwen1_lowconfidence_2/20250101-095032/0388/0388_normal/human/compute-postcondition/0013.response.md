The variable `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. This means the value of `at_start` changes directly, while the other variables (`args`, `file`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`args` contains at least two elements; `at_start` is `False`; `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of `x`, followed by the string representation of the next element in `args`, followed by `sep`.**
