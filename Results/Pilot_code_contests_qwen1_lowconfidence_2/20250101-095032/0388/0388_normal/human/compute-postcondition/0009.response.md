According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will continue as long as `args` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `args` contains at least one element.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element. Since we are about to enter another iteration of the loop, `args` will lose one of its elements (the current `x`). Therefore, `args` must contain at least two elements to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`args` contains at least two elements; `at_start` is `False`; `file` now contains the original content plus the string representations of `x` and the next element in `args`.**
