The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `file` variable by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. Since `kwargs` is not explicitly defined in the initial state and the code only pops a value from `kwargs` with a default of `\n`, we assume `kwargs` might contain the key `'end'` with some value, or it might not.

However, without a specific value for `kwargs`, we can only say that `kwargs` will lose the key `'end'` if it contained it, and `file` will have its content updated with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.

Given the initial state, the output state would be:

Output State: **`args` contains all the elements that were originally in it; `at_start` is `False`; `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of the value popped from `kwargs` with a default of `\n`; `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'` if it originally did.**
