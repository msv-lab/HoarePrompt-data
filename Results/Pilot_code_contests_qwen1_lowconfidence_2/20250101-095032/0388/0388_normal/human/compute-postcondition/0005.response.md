The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. Since `at_start` is false, this is the first write operation, and `sep` will be written without any preceding separator. The state of `args` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`args` contains at least one element, `at_start` is false, and `file` has `sep` written to it.**
