The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`args`, `file`, `sep`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `at_start` and retains the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`args` contains at least three elements, `at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of the current `x`, followed by the string representation of the next element in `args`, followed by `sep`, and `sep` has been written to the file, and the string representation of `x` has been written to the file.**
