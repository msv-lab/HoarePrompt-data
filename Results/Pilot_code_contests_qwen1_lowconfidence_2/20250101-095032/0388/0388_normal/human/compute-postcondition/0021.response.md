Postcondition: **`args` contains all the elements that were originally in it; `at_start` is `False`; `file` now contains the original content plus the string representation of the value popped from `kwargs` with a default of `\n`; `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'` if it originally did; the current value of `flush` is `True`**
