You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


2


Input


6 2
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


0


Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the number of distinct values \(K\) is greater than the maximum possible value that can be stored in the given disk size \(I\).

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

**Input:**
```
6 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation:**
- There are 6 distinct values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- The smallest \(k\) such that \(2^k \geq 6\) is \(k = 3\) (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
- Therefore, we need \(3 \times 6 = 18\) bits to store the entire array.
- Since \(I = 1\) byte = 8 bits, the file does not fit, and all values need to be compressed to the smallest possible range that fits into 8 bits.

However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly. It attempts to find a subarray of length equal to the minimum number of bits required (\(md = 2^{8 \cdot I / n}\)) and calculates the number of unchanged elements, which is incorrect for this case.

The correct approach should involve finding the optimal \(l\) and \(r\) such that the number of distinct values is minimized while ensuring the file fits within the given disk size. The current implementation does not account for this logic properly.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

def func_1():

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State Recap:
    #- `ca`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values.
    #- `md`: 2
    #- `pref`: A prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`.
    #- `s`: Equal to `n`.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis:
    #The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(pref) - md` (exclusive). This means it starts from `0` and goes up to `len(pref) - 2`.
    #
    ##### Loop Execution:
    #- For each iteration `i` in the loop, `u` is calculated as `pref[i + md] - pref[i]`.
    #- `s` is updated to be the minimum of `s` and `n - u`.
    #
    #Given this, let's break down the loop execution:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[2] - pref[0]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #   
    #2. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[3] - pref[1]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #   
    #3. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[4] - pref[2]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #
    #And so on until `i = len(pref) - 3`.
    #
    #### Final State Calculation:
    #After the loop completes all its iterations, `s` will be the minimum value obtained by evaluating `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` values.
    #
    #Since the loop updates `s` based on the difference between elements of `pref` at positions `i` and `i + 2`, and the loop runs from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`, the final value of `s` will be the smallest value of `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #- `ca`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `ca`.
    #- `md`: Remains `2`.
    #- `pref`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `pref`.
    #- `s`: Is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`).
    #
    #Thus, the final state after the loop finishes executing is:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `ca` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values.
    #- `md` is `2`.
    #- `pref` is the prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`.
    #- `s` is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`).
    #- `i` is `len(pref) - 3`.
    #- `u` is `pref[len(pref) - 1] - pref[len(pref) - 3]`.
    #- `len(pref)` is at least 3.
    if (len(pref) - md <= 0) :
        s = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ca` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values; `md` is 2; `pref` is the prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`; `s` is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`); `i` is `len(pref) - 3`; `u` is `pref[len(pref) - 1] - pref[len(pref) - 3]`; `len(pref)` is at least 3. If the length of `pref` minus `md` is less than or equal to 0, then `s` is 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
