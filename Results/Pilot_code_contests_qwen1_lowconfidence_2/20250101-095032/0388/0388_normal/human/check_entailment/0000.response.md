Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of changed elements while ensuring the file fits within the given disk size. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the initial number of distinct values is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that can fit within the given disk size without any changes.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `md`**:
   - The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which is meant to determine the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into the given disk size. However, this calculation does not directly reflect the minimum number of distinct values needed to fit the data into the disk.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Changes**:
   - The program uses a prefix sum array `pref` to calculate the number of elements that need to be changed for different ranges of distinct values. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of distinct values is already small enough to fit within the disk size without any changes.

3. **Lack of Handling Small Initial Distinct Values**:
   - The program does not check if the initial number of distinct values is already small enough to fit within the disk size without any changes. This is crucial because if the initial number of distinct values is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that can fit within the disk size, no changes should be made.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
- The initial distinct values are `1, 2, 3`, which means `K = 3`.
- The required bits per value would be `k = ⌈ log_{2} 3 ⌉ = 2`.
- The total bits required to store the file would be `6 * 2 = 12` bits.
- Since `12` bits cannot fit into `1` byte (`8` bits), the program should output `2` (the number of distinct values minus one, as explained in the problem statement).

However, the program does not correctly handle this case and fails to output the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
