Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to achieve the goal of minimizing the number of changed elements while ensuring that the compressed data fits within the given disk size \( I \) bytes.

#### Key Issues:

1. **Incorrect Compression Logic:**
   - The program does not actually perform the compression logic as specified in the problem description. It calculates the number of distinct values and the corresponding bit requirement but does not apply the actual compression to the input array to minimize the number of changes.
   - The main function `func_1()` calculates the minimum number of changes required but does not perform the compression itself. Instead, it computes a theoretical minimum number of changes without altering the input array.

2. **Lack of Compression Implementation:**
   - The program does not include the logic to find the optimal range `[l, r]` that minimizes the number of changes while ensuring the compressed data fits within the disk size \( I \) bytes.
   - The program does not update the input array to reflect the compressed values as described in the problem statement.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Output:**
   - The program calls `func_2(s)` at the end, but `func_2()` is a utility function that simply prints the value of `s`. It does not perform the necessary output formatting as required by the problem description, which states that the output should be the minimal possible number of changed elements.

4. **Misalignment with Problem Requirements:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimal number of changes while ensuring the compressed data fits within the disk size. The program only computes the minimal number of changes without performing the actual compression or fitting the data to the disk size.

### Correct Approach:

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to:
1. Calculate the number of distinct values.
2. Determine the smallest \( k = \lceil \log_2 K \rceil \) such that the compressed data fits within \( I \) bytes.
3. Find the optimal range `[l, r]` that minimizes the number of changes while ensuring the compressed data fits within the disk size.
4. Apply the compression by changing the values outside the range `[l, r]` to either `l` or `r`.
5. Output the minimal number of changes required.

The current implementation does not include steps 3 and 4, which are crucial for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
