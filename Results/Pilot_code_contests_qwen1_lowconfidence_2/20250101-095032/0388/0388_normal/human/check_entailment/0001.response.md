Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the number of distinct values \(K\) is greater than the maximum possible value that can be stored in the given disk size \(I\).

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

**Input:**
```
6 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation:**
- There are 6 distinct values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- The smallest \(k\) such that \(2^k \geq 6\) is \(k = 3\) (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
- Therefore, we need \(3 \times 6 = 18\) bits to store the entire array.
- Since \(I = 1\) byte = 8 bits, the file does not fit, and all values need to be compressed to the smallest possible range that fits into 8 bits.

However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly. It attempts to find a subarray of length equal to the minimum number of bits required (\(md = 2^{8 \cdot I / n}\)) and calculates the number of unchanged elements, which is incorrect for this case.

The correct approach should involve finding the optimal \(l\) and \(r\) such that the number of distinct values is minimized while ensuring the file fits within the given disk size. The current implementation does not account for this logic properly.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
