Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the compression algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code focuses on finding the minimum number of changes needed to fit the compressed sound file into a disk of size \(I\) bytes, but it does not actually perform the compression according to the specified rules.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Compression Logic Missing**: The core logic to perform the compression by choosing appropriate values \(l\) and \(r\) is missing. The code only calculates the number of changes needed but does not actually adjust the values in the array based on the chosen \(l\) and \(r\).

2. **MD Calculation**: The variable `md` is calculated as `2 ** (8 * i / n)`, which is meant to determine the number of bits required to store the distinct values. However, this does not directly translate to choosing \(l\) and \(r\) for compression.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop in `func_1` calculates the number of unchanged elements for different segments but does not perform the actual compression. It sets `s` to the minimum number of changes needed, but it does not update the array to reflect these changes.

4. **Output Logic**: The function `func_2` is a utility function for printing, and it does not interact with the main problem of compression and fitting the file into the disk size.

### Example Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3
```

- According to the problem description, we need to find the minimal number of changes such that the file fits into 1 byte. Since 1 byte contains 8 bits, we need \( \lceil \log_2 K \rceil = \lceil \log_2 4 \rceil = 2 \) bits to store each value, requiring \(6 \times 2 = 12\) bits, which is more than 8 bits. Therefore, we need to compress the values to fit into 8 bits.

- The optimal compression here would be to keep values in the range [2, 3] and change all other values to either 2 or 3. This would require changing 2 elements (1 and 4).

However, the provided code does not perform this compression and simply calculates the number of changes without actually modifying the array. As a result, it would incorrectly output 2, but the correct answer should be 2 because it is the minimal number of changes needed.

Since the code does not perform the actual compression and only calculates the number of changes, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
