You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, i) are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8; ca is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values; md is an integer calculated as the smallest power of 2 such that the number of distinct values K is less than or equal to 2^md, which is determined by the formula md = 2^(8 * i / n); pref is a prefix sum list of the frequencies of the unique integers; s is the initial count of the minimum number of changes needed, initialized to n; the loop iterates over a range determined by the length of pref minus md, calculating the number of unchanged elements for each segment and updating s with the minimum value found; if the range end is less than or equal to 0, s is set to 0 before calling func_2(s).
def func_1():
    n, i = map(int, input().split())
    ca = sorted(Counter(map(int, input().split())).items(), key=lambda x: x[0])
    md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))

    for i in range(len(pref) - md):
        u = pref[i + md] - pref[i]
        
        s = min(s, n - u)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State Recap:
    #- `ca`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values.
    #- `md`: 2
    #- `pref`: A prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`.
    #- `s`: Equal to `n`.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis:
    #The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(pref) - md` (exclusive). This means it starts from `0` and goes up to `len(pref) - 2`.
    #
    ##### Loop Execution:
    #- For each iteration `i` in the loop, `u` is calculated as `pref[i + md] - pref[i]`.
    #- `s` is updated to be the minimum of `s` and `n - u`.
    #
    #Given this, let's break down the loop execution:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[2] - pref[0]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #   
    #2. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[3] - pref[1]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #   
    #3. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[4] - pref[2]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #
    #And so on until `i = len(pref) - 3`.
    #
    #### Final State Calculation:
    #After the loop completes all its iterations, `s` will be the minimum value obtained by evaluating `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` values.
    #
    #Since the loop updates `s` based on the difference between elements of `pref` at positions `i` and `i + 2`, and the loop runs from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`, the final value of `s` will be the smallest value of `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #- `ca`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `ca`.
    #- `md`: Remains `2`.
    #- `pref`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `pref`.
    #- `s`: Is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`).
    #
    #Thus, the final state after the loop finishes executing is:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `ca` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values.
    #- `md` is `2`.
    #- `pref` is the prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`.
    #- `s` is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`).
    #- `i` is `len(pref) - 3`.
    #- `u` is `pref[len(pref) - 1] - pref[len(pref) - 3]`.
    #- `len(pref)` is at least 3.
    if (len(pref) - md <= 0) :
        s = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ca` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values; `md` is 2; `pref` is the prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`; `s` is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`); `i` is `len(pref) - 3`; `u` is `pref[len(pref) - 1] - pref[len(pref) - 3]`; `len(pref)` is at least 3. If the length of `pref` minus `md` is less than or equal to 0, then `s` is 0.
    func_2(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer inputs `n` and `i`, and internally constructs a list of tuples `ca` containing unique integers and their frequencies from the input list, sorted by integer values. It then calculates `md` as the smallest power of 2 such that the number of distinct values is less than or equal to \(2^md\), and generates a prefix sum list `pref` of the frequencies. The function iterates over a range determined by `len(pref) - md`, calculating the number of unchanged elements for each segment and updating the variable `s` with the minimum value found. If the range end is less than or equal to 0, `s` is set to 0. Finally, the function calls `func_2(s)`. Potential edge cases include when the length of `pref` minus `md` is less than or equal to 0, in which case `s` is set to 0. The function does not modify `ca` or `pref` after their initial construction. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `s` is the minimum number of changes needed, possibly set to 0 if the range condition is met.

I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
