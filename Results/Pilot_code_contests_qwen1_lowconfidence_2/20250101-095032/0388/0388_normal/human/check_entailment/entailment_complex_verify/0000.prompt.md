You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


2


Input


6 2
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


0


Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.

    pref = [0]
    for (_, j) in ca:
        pref.append(pref[-1] + j)
    s = n
    for i in range(len(pref) - md):
        u = pref[i + md] - pref[i]
        s = min(s, n - u)
    if len(pref) - md <= 0:
        s = 0

    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of changed elements while ensuring the file fits within the given disk size. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the initial number of distinct values is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that can fit within the given disk size without any changes.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `md`**:
   - The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which is meant to determine the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into the given disk size. However, this calculation does not directly reflect the minimum number of distinct values needed to fit the data into the disk.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Changes**:
   - The program uses a prefix sum array `pref` to calculate the number of elements that need to be changed for different ranges of distinct values. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of distinct values is already small enough to fit within the disk size without any changes.

3. **Lack of Handling Small Initial Distinct Values**:
   - The program does not check if the initial number of distinct values is already small enough to fit within the disk size without any changes. This is crucial because if the initial number of distinct values is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that can fit within the disk size, no changes should be made.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
- The initial distinct values are `1, 2, 3`, which means `K = 3`.
- The required bits per value would be `k = ⌈ log_{2} 3 ⌉ = 2`.
- The total bits required to store the file would be `6 * 2 = 12` bits.
- Since `12` bits cannot fit into `1` byte (`8` bits), the program should output `2` (the number of distinct values minus one, as explained in the problem statement).

However, the program does not correctly handle this case and fails to output the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

def func_1():
    n, i = map(int, input().split())

    s = n
    for i in range(len(pref) - md):
        u = pref[i + md] - pref[i]
        
        s = min(s, n - u)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State Recap:
    #- `ca`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values.
    #- `md`: 2
    #- `pref`: A prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`.
    #- `s`: Equal to `n`.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis:
    #The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(pref) - md` (exclusive). This means it starts from `0` and goes up to `len(pref) - 2`.
    #
    ##### Loop Execution:
    #- For each iteration `i` in the loop, `u` is calculated as `pref[i + md] - pref[i]`.
    #- `s` is updated to be the minimum of `s` and `n - u`.
    #
    #Given this, let's break down the loop execution:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[2] - pref[0]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #   
    #2. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[3] - pref[1]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #   
    #3. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
    #   - `u = pref[4] - pref[2]`
    #   - `s = min(s, n - u)`
    #
    #And so on until `i = len(pref) - 3`.
    #
    #### Final State Calculation:
    #After the loop completes all its iterations, `s` will be the minimum value obtained by evaluating `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` values.
    #
    #Since the loop updates `s` based on the difference between elements of `pref` at positions `i` and `i + 2`, and the loop runs from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`, the final value of `s` will be the smallest value of `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #- `ca`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `ca`.
    #- `md`: Remains `2`.
    #- `pref`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `pref`.
    #- `s`: Is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`).
    #
    #Thus, the final state after the loop finishes executing is:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `ca` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values.
    #- `md` is `2`.
    #- `pref` is the prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`.
    #- `s` is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`).
    #- `i` is `len(pref) - 3`.
    #- `u` is `pref[len(pref) - 1] - pref[len(pref) - 3]`.
    #- `len(pref)` is at least 3.
    if (len(pref) - md <= 0) :
        s = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ca` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input list and its frequency, sorted by the integer values; `md` is 2; `pref` is the prefix sum list starting from 0 where each element is the cumulative sum of the frequencies up to that point in `ca`; `s` is the minimum value obtained from `n - (pref[i + 2] - pref[i])` for all valid `i` (i.e., from `0` to `len(pref) - 3`); `i` is `len(pref) - 3`; `u` is `pref[len(pref) - 1] - pref[len(pref) - 3]`; `len(pref)` is at least 3. If the length of `pref` minus `md` is less than or equal to 0, then `s` is 0.
    func_2(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer inputs `n` and `i`, and internally constructs a list of tuples `ca` containing unique integers and their frequencies from the input list, sorted by integer values. It then calculates `md` as the smallest power of 2 such that the number of distinct values is less than or equal to \(2^md\), and generates a prefix sum list `pref` of the frequencies. The function iterates over a range determined by `len(pref) - md`, calculating the number of unchanged elements for each segment and updating the variable `s` with the minimum value found. If the range end is less than or equal to 0, `s` is set to 0. Finally, the function calls `func_2(s)`. Potential edge cases include when the length of `pref` minus `md` is less than or equal to 0, in which case `s` is set to 0. The function does not modify `ca` or `pref` after their initial construction. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `s` is the minimum number of changes needed, possibly set to 0 if the range condition is met.
