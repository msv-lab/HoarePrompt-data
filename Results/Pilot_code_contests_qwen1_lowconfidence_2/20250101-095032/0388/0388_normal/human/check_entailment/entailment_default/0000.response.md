Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of changes required to fit the sound file into the given disk size. However, the logic used to determine the segments for calculating the number of unchanged elements is flawed.

The critical issue lies in the calculation of `md` and the subsequent iteration over the `pref` list. The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which aims to determine the maximum number of distinct values allowed based on the available bits. However, the iteration over the `pref` list to find the minimum number of changes is done using `range(len(pref) - md)`. This range does not correctly capture all possible segments for changing values to fit the disk size.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3
```
The output should be 2, as explained in the example. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle this case due to the incorrect range calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using binary search or dynamic programming to find the optimal segment lengths that minimize the number of changes while fitting within the disk size.
