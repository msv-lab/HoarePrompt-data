You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base bx and a number Y represented in base by. Compare those two numbers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.

Output

Output a single character (quotes for clarity): 

  * '<' if X < Y
  * '>' if X > Y
  * '=' if X = Y

Examples

Output

Note

In the first sample, X = 1011112 = 4710 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 1023 = 215 and Y = 245 = 1123, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, <image> and Y = 48031509. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and bx is much larger than by, so X is clearly larger than Y.
