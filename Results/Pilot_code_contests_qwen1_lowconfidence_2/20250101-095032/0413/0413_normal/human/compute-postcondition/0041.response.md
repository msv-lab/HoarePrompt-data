Functionality: **The function reads two sets of integers representing digits of numbers in different bases from standard input, converts these digit sequences into their corresponding numerical values, and then compares these values. It outputs either '>', '=', or '<' indicating whether the first number is greater than, equal to, or less than the second number. The function handles potential edge cases such as ensuring the base values are within valid ranges (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and 2 ≤ by ≤ 40) and that the first digits of each number sequence are not zero. However, it does not handle cases where the input bases are invalid (i.e., outside the specified range), which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function assumes the input is well-formed and does not check for non-integer inputs or other forms of malformed data.**
