`y` is updated to its current value plus `b^i * a`. Given that `i = m - 3`, `y` was initially defined as `b^y + b^(y + m - 2) * ys[1]`, and `a` is `ys[2]`, the new value of `y` is calculated as follows:

- The term `b^i * a` translates to `b^(m - 3) * ys[2]`.
- Therefore, the updated value of `y` is `b^y + b^(y + m - 2) * ys[1] + b^(m - 3) * ys[2]`.

Since no other variables are affected, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `b^x`; `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`; `y` is `b^y + b^(y + m - 2) * ys[1] + b^(m - 3) * ys[2]`; `i` is `m - 3`; `a` is `ys[2]`**
