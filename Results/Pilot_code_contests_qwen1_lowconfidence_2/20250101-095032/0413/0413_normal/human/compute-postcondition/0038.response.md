Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `bx`, `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`, `y` is the sum of the weighted integers from `ys` with weights given by powers of `by`, and `ans` is either `'='`, `'>'`, or `'<'` depending on the comparison between `x` and `y`.***
