The code `ans = '='` simply assigns the value `=` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `m`, `y`, or any other variables. The conditions and values of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `bx`, `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`, `y` is the sum of the weighted integers from `ys` with weights given by powers of `by`, and `ans` is '='.**
