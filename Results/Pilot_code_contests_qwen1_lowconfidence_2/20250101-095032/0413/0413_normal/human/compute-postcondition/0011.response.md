Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `a` is an integer from `xs[n - 1 - i]`.
   - `x` is updated to `x + bx`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `-1`.
   - On each iteration, `a` is assigned the value of `xs[n - 1 - i]`.
   - `x` is updated to `x + bx`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been decremented to `-1`, meaning the loop will stop executing.
   - Therefore, we need to determine the state before the loop starts again.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 1`.
   - `a` will be set to `xs[n - 1 - (n - 1)] = xs[0]`.
   - `x` will be updated to `x + bx` as it happens within the loop body but we don't know the exact update yet, but we know the condition for the loop to continue.

6. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `a` is now an integer from `xs[0]`.
   - `x` is updated to `x + bx` from the last iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is an integer from `xs[0]`; `x` is updated to `x + bx`**
