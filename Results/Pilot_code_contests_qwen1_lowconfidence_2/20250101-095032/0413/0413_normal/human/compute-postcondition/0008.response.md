Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `a` is an integer from `xs[n - 1 - i]`.
   - `x` is updated to `x + bx`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs in reverse from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since we are looking at the state before the next iteration, we need to determine the value of `i` at the end of the current iteration.

4. **Determining `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the value that made the loop condition true.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be decreased by 1 (since the loop runs in reverse).

5. **Updating the State:**
   - `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `a` will now be taken from `xs[n - 1 - (i - 1)]` since `i` is decreasing by 1.
   - `x` will be updated again in the next iteration as `x + bx`.

6. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is still greater than or equal to 0.

Given this reasoning, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be decreased by 1.
- `a` will be from `xs[n - 1 - (i - 1)]` where `i` is the new value of `i`.
- `x` will be updated again as `x + bx`.

Assuming `i` was the last valid index at the end of the previous iteration, the next valid `i` would be `i - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is an integer from `xs[n - 1 - (i - 1)]`; `x` is updated to `x + bx`**
