The code `s = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. The resulting list is stored in the variable `s`. 

The initial values of `n` and `m` are still within their respective ranges, and the lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10; `x` is a list of n integers; `y` is a list of m integers; `s` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a line of input by spaces; 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40; 2 ≤ by ≤ 40; x1 and y1 are not zero; all digits are in the range 0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by.**
