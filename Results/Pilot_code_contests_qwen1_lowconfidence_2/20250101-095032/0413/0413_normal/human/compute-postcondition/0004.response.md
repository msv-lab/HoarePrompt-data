The code snippet `xs = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `xs`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `s[0]`
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10
- `x` is 0
- `y` is a list of `m` integers
- `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`
- `by` is between 2 and 40
- `x1` and `y1` are not zero
- All digits are in the range 0 ≤ `xi` < `bx` and 0 ≤ `yi` < `by`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `xs` will be a list of strings split from the input line. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `bx`, `by`, `x1`, and `y1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `s[0]`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10; `x` is 0; `y` is a list of `m` integers; `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`; `by` is between 2 and 40; `x1` and `y1` are not zero; `xs` is a list of strings split from the input line.**
