The code snippet assigns the value of `xs[n - 1 - i]` to the variable `a` after converting it to an integer using `int()`. The initial state is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer from `xs[n - 1 - (i - 1)]`, and `x` is updated to `x + bx`. After executing the line `a = int(xs[n - 1 - i])`, the value of `a` changes to the integer value of `xs[n - 1 - i]`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is now an integer from `xs[n - 1 - i]`; `x` is updated to `x + bx`**
