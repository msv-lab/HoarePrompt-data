`ans` is assigned the value of the string `'<'`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `m`, `y`, `xs`, `ys`, `bx`, and `by`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `bx`, `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`, `y` is the sum of the weighted integers from `ys` with weights given by powers of `by`, `ans` is `<`.**
