Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `b^x`.
   - `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`.
   - `y` is `b^y`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `m - 1` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means it starts from `m - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state just before the next iteration begins.

4. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Since the loop decrements `i` starting from `m - 1`, the loop will stop when `i` becomes `-1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, if the loop continues, `i` should be `i - 1`.
   - The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `m - 1`. So, in the next iteration, `i` will be `m - 2`.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `n`, `x`, `m`, and `y` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but no such modification is mentioned in the provided example.

Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude the following:

- The loop will continue if `i` is greater than `-1`. Given that `i` was `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `m - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `m`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` is a non-negative integer; `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `b^x`; `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`; `y` is `b^y`; `i` is `m - 2`**.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `b^x`; `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`; `y` is `b^y`; `i` is `m - 2`**
