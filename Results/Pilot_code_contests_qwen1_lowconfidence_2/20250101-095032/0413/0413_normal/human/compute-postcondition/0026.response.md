Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `b^x`.
   - `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`.
   - `y` is `b^y + b^(y + m - 2) * ys[1]`.
   - `i` is `m - 2`.
   - `a` is `ys[1]`.

2. **Understand the Loop**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This means the loop starts from `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` until `i = -1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `m - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be decremented to `m - 3` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `i - 1`, so `i` will now be `m - 3`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `x`, `m`, `y`, `a`, `xs`, `ys`, `b`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications to these variables are specified.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` being decremented by 1, while all other variables remain the same.

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `b^x`; `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`; `y` is `b^y + b^(y + m - 2) * ys[1]`; `i` is `m - 3`; `a` is `ys[1]`**
