`x` is assigned the value 0. The value of `x` is updated, but the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `s[0]`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10, `x` is 0, `y` is a list of `m` integers, `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`, `by` is between 2 and 40, `x1` and `y1` are not zero, all digits are in the range 0 ≤ `xi` < `bx` and 0 ≤ `yi` < `by`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `s[0]`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10, `x` is 0, `y` is a list of `m` integers, `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`, `by` is between 2 and 40, `x1` and `y1` are not zero, all digits are in the range 0 ≤ `xi` < `bx` and 0 ≤ `yi` < `by`.**
