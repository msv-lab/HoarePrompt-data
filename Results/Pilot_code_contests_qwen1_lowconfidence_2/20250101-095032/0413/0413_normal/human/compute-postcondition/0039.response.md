The `print(ans)` statement simply outputs the value of the variable `ans`. It does not change the value of `ans` or any other variable. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `bx`, `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`, `y` is the sum of the weighted integers from `ys` with weights given by powers of `by`, and `ans` is either `'='`, `'>'`, or `'<'` depending on the comparison between `x` and `y`.**
