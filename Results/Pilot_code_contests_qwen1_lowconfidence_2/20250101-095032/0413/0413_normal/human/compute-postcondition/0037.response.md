Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `bx`, `m` is an integer such that `m >= 1`, `y` is the sum of the weighted integers from `ys` with weights given by powers of `by`, `ans` is either `'>'` or `'<'` depending on whether the sum of the weighted integers from `xs` with weights given by powers of `bx` is greater than or less than the sum of the weighted integers from `ys` with weights given by powers of `by`.***
