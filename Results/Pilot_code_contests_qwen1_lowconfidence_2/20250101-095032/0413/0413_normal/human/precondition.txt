n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ bx, by ≤ 40 with bx ≠ by. The digits of X (x1, x2, ..., xn) and Y (y1, y2, ..., ym) are given as space-separated integers on separate lines, and both X and Y are represented in their respective bases (bx and by). All digits are in the range 0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by, and there are no leading zeroes.
