You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base bx and a number Y represented in base by. Compare those two numbers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.

Output

Output a single character (quotes for clarity): 

  * '<' if X < Y
  * '>' if X > Y
  * '=' if X = Y

Note

In the first sample, X = 1011112 = 4710 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 1023 = 215 and Y = 245 = 1123, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, <image> and Y = 48031509. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and bx is much larger than by, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    n = int(s[0])
    bx = int(s[1])
    x = 0
    xs = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(xs[n - 1 - i])
        x = x + bx ** i * a
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    m = int(s[0])
    by = int(s[1])
    y = 0
    ys = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(ys[m - 1 - i])
        y = y + by ** i * a
    if x == y:
        ans = '='
    elif x > y:
        ans = '>'
    else:
        ans = '<'
    print(ans)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly converts the numbers X and Y from their respective bases to base 10 and compares them. Here’s a brief walkthrough of how the program works:

1. It reads the base and the number of digits for X, then converts X from base `bx` to base 10.
2. It reads the base and the number of digits for Y, then converts Y from base `by` to base 10.
3. It compares the two base 10 values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=').

Given the constraints and examples, the program handles the conversion and comparison correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or errors in the logic that would cause the program to fail for any valid input within the specified ranges. Thus, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10, and 2 ≤ by ≤ 40 with bx ≠ by. The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn representing the digits of X in base bx, and the fourth line contains m integers y1, y2, ..., ym representing the digits of Y in base by. Both x1 and y1 are guaranteed not to be zero, and all digits are in the range 0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by.

    s = raw_input().split(' ')

        ans = '='

        if (x > y) :

    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two sets of integers representing digits of numbers in different bases from standard input, converts these digit sequences into their corresponding numerical values, and then compares these values. It outputs either '>', '=', or '<' indicating whether the first number is greater than, equal to, or less than the second number. The function handles potential edge cases such as ensuring the base values are within valid ranges (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and 2 ≤ by ≤ 40) and that the first digits of each number sequence are not zero. However, it does not handle cases where the input bases are invalid (i.e., outside the specified range), which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function assumes the input is well-formed and does not check for non-integer inputs or other forms of malformed data.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
