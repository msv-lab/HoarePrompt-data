Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly converts the numbers X and Y from their respective bases to base 10 and compares them. Hereâ€™s a brief walkthrough of how the program works:

1. It reads the base and the number of digits for X, then converts X from base `bx` to base 10.
2. It reads the base and the number of digits for Y, then converts Y from base `by` to base 10.
3. It compares the two base 10 values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=').

Given the constraints and examples, the program handles the conversion and comparison correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or errors in the logic that would cause the program to fail for any valid input within the specified ranges. Thus, the program is correct.
