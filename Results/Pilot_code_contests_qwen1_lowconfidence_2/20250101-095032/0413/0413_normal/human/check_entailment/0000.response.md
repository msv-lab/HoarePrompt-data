Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the bases \(bx\) and \(by\) are equal, although the problem description mentions that \(bx \neq by\). However, the main issue is that the program reads input using `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`.

More importantly, the program logic for converting the numbers from their respective bases to decimal is correct, and the comparison logic is also correct. The only issues are the Python version compatibility and the handling of equal bases, which is not explicitly required but still important to note.

Since the core functionality of the program works as intended and the problem description does not explicitly state that \(bx \neq by\) must be handled separately, the program is mostly correct. However, to strictly adhere to the problem description and ensure full correctness, the program should handle the case where \(bx = by\) appropriately, which is not currently implemented.

If we assume the intention is to handle all cases as described, then the program needs to handle the equality of bases properly or explicitly state that such cases are not required. Given the current implementation, the program fails to meet the exact requirements in a generalized sense, hence the answer is **False**.
