Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the necessary inputs (number of digits and digits themselves) for both \(X\) and \(Y\).
   - It ensures that the bases \(bx\) and \(by\) are within the specified range (2 ≤ \(bx\) ≤ 40 and 2 ≤ \(by\) ≤ 40) and are different (\(bx \neq by\)).

2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
   - The program correctly converts the \(n\)-digit number \(X\) from base \(bx\) to its decimal equivalent.
   - Similarly, it converts the \(m\)-digit number \(Y\) from base \(by\) to its decimal equivalent.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both numbers to decimal form, the program compares them and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison result.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the first digits of each number sequence are not zero.
   - It correctly processes inputs where the number of digits \(n\) and \(m\) are within the specified limits (1 ≤ \(n\) ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ \(m\) ≤ 10).

Since the program follows all the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly performs the required operations without any omissions or errors, it is correct.
