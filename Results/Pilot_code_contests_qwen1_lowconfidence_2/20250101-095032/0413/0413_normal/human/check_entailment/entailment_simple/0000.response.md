Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers \(X\) and \(Y\) represented in different bases. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of digits and the base for \(X\) and \(Y\) from the first two lines of input.
   - It then reads the digits of \(X\) and \(Y\) from the subsequent lines, converting them into their respective decimal values. This is done using the formula \( \text{value} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i \times \text{base}^i \), where \(d_i\) are the digits and \(\text{base}\) is the base of the number.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After calculating the decimal values of \(X\) and \(Y\), the program compares these values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '=', '>') based on the comparison result.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output as per the problem statement.

Since the program accurately performs all steps required to solve the problem as described, including converting the numbers from their given bases to decimal and comparing them, the program is correct.
