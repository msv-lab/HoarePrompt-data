Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input bases are invalid (i.e., outside the specified range of 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and 2 ≤ by ≤ 40). According to the problem description, the function should validate the input bases to ensure they are within the valid range. If the bases are out of this range, the function should raise an error or handle this case appropriately. However, the current implementation does not include any checks for these conditions, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. For example, if `bx` or `by` is 1 or 41, the program will not handle this correctly and may produce incorrect results or raise an error. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
