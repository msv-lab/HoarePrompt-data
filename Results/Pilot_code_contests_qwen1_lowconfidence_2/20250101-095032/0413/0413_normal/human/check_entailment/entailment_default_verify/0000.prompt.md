You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base bx and a number Y represented in base by. Compare those two numbers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.

Output

Output a single character (quotes for clarity): 

  * '<' if X < Y
  * '>' if X > Y
  * '=' if X = Y

Note

In the first sample, X = 1011112 = 4710 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 1023 = 215 and Y = 245 = 1123, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, <image> and Y = 48031509. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and bx is much larger than by, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    n = int(s[0])
    bx = int(s[1])
    x = 0
    xs = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(xs[n - 1 - i])
        x = x + bx ** i * a
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    m = int(s[0])
    by = int(s[1])
    y = 0
    ys = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(ys[m - 1 - i])
        y = y + by ** i * a
    if x == y:
        ans = '='
    elif x > y:
        ans = '>'
    else:
        ans = '<'
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the bases \(bx\) and \(by\) are equal, although the problem description mentions that \(bx \neq by\). However, the main issue is that the program reads input using `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`.

More importantly, the program logic for converting the numbers from their respective bases to decimal is correct, and the comparison logic is also correct. The only issues are the Python version compatibility and the handling of equal bases, which is not explicitly required but still important to note.

Since the core functionality of the program works as intended and the problem description does not explicitly state that \(bx \neq by\) must be handled separately, the program is mostly correct. However, to strictly adhere to the problem description and ensure full correctness, the program should handle the case where \(bx = by\) appropriately, which is not currently implemented.

If we assume the intention is to handle all cases as described, then the program needs to handle the equality of bases properly or explicitly state that such cases are not required. Given the current implementation, the program fails to meet the exact requirements in a generalized sense, hence the answer is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two sets of integers representing digits of numbers in different bases from standard input, converts these digit sequences into their corresponding numerical values, and then compares these values. It outputs either '>', '=', or '<' indicating whether the first number is greater than, equal to, or less than the second number. The function handles potential edge cases such as ensuring the base values are within valid ranges (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and 2 ≤ by ≤ 40) and that the first digits of each number sequence are not zero. However, it does not handle cases where the input bases are invalid (i.e., outside the specified range), which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function assumes the input is well-formed and does not check for non-integer inputs or other forms of malformed data.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
