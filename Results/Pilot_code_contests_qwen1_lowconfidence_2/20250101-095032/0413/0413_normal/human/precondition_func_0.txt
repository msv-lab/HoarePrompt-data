n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10, and 2 ≤ by ≤ 40 with bx ≠ by. The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn representing the digits of X in base bx, and the fourth line contains m integers y1, y2, ..., ym representing the digits of Y in base by. Both x1 and y1 are guaranteed not to be zero, and all digits are in the range 0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by.
