You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored A·B·C hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped A layers high. Each layer had B rows and each row had C blocks.

At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (A - 1) × (B - 2) × (C - 2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1 × 1 × 1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted n hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers A, B и C.

Given number n, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.

Input

The only line contains integer n from the problem's statement (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).

Output

Print space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.

Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

4


Output

28 41

Output

48 105

Note

Let's consider the first sample test. If initially Sam has a parallelepiped consisting of 32 = 2 × 4 × 4 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4 = (2 - 1) × (4 - 2) × (4 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32 - 4 = 28 hay blocks. If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 45 = 5 × 3 × 3 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4 = (5 - 1) × (3 - 2) × (3 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 45 - 4 = 41 hay blocks. No other variants of the blocks' initial arrangement (that leave Sam with exactly 4 blocks after the theft) can permit the thieves to steal less than 28 or more than 41 blocks.
