Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `A`, `B`, and `C`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq (A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) \leq n\). After performing the computation, it returns the value of the expression `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`. This expression involves multiplying and adding the given parameters according to a specific formula. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that the input values satisfy the initial condition \(1 \leq (A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) \leq n\). If this condition is not met, the function will still compute the expression using the provided values, though it might not have the intended behavior in such cases.**
