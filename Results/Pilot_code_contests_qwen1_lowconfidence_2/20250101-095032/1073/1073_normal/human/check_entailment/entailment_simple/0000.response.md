Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks based on the provided problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads the input `n` which represents the number of hay blocks left after the theft.
   
2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints '17 17'. This is a special case handled to simplify the problem for the smallest valid input.
   
3. **Calculating Maximum Stolen Blocks**:
   - The variable `mx` is set to `8 * n + 9`, which represents the maximum possible number of stolen blocks. This calculation ensures that if no blocks were left, the maximum number of stolen blocks would be `8 * 1 + 9 = 17`.

4. **Iterative Search for Minimum Stolen Blocks**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of `A` from `int(math.sqrt(float(n))) + 1` down to 1.
   - For each value of `A`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `A`. If so, it calculates possible values of `B` and `C` such that `(A-1) * (B-2) * (C-2) <= n`.
   - It uses the function `func_1` to calculate the number of stolen blocks for each valid combination of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
   - The function `func_1` computes the number of stolen blocks using the formula `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`.

5. **Updating Minimum Value**:
   - The minimum value of stolen blocks found during the iterations is stored in `mn`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks.

### Why the Program Works:

- **Correct Input Handling**: The program handles the input `n` correctly and processes it without causing any errors.
- **Comprehensive Search**: By iterating over all possible values of `A`, `B`, and `C` that satisfy the condition, the program ensures that both the minimum and maximum values of stolen blocks are found.
- **Formula Accuracy**: The function `func_1` accurately calculates the number of stolen blocks based on the given formula.
- **Edge Cases**: Special cases like `n = 1` are handled appropriately.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
