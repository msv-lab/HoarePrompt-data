Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks. The annotated version helps to understand that the logic within the `func_1` function and the overall calculation of `mn` and `mx` do not align with the problem requirements. For instance, the annotated version shows that the function `func_1` computes a value that does not represent the number of stolen hay blocks correctly. Specifically, the formula used in `func_1` does not reflect the correct mathematical relationship between the initial number of hay blocks and the number of stolen hay blocks. Therefore, the program continues to produce incorrect results, as evidenced by the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs for given inputs.
