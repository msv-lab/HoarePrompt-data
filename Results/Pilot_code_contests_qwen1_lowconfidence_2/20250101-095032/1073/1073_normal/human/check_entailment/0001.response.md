Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the overall logic for calculating `mn` and `mx` do not align with the problem description.

For instance, consider the input `n = 4`. According to the problem description, the minimally possible number of stolen hay blocks is 28 and the maximally possible number is 41. However, the program incorrectly calculates these values.

To illustrate, let's walk through the program's logic for `n = 4`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n = 4`
   - `r = int(math.sqrt(float(n))) + 1 = 2`
   - `r3 = int(10 ** (math.log10(float(n)) / 3)) - 1 = 0`
   - `mx = 8 * n + 9 = 37`

2. **Loop for `r`**:
   - When `r = 2`:
     - `m = n / r = 2`
     - `B = int(math.sqrt(float(m))) + 1 = 2`
     - While loop for `B`:
       - When `B = 2`:
         - `C = m / B = 1`
         - `mn = min([mn, func_1(A, B, C), func_1(B, A, C), func_1(C, B, A)])`
         - `func_1(A, B, C) = 2 * (2 + 1) * (2 + 1 + 2) + 2 * 1 = 2 * 3 * 5 + 2 = 32`
         - `func_1(B, A, C) = 2 * (2 + 1) * (2 + 2 + 2) + 2 * 1 = 2 * 3 * 6 + 2 = 38`
         - `func_1(C, B, A) = 2 * (1 + 1) * (2 + 2 + 2) + 1 * 2 = 2 * 2 * 6 + 2 = 26`
         - `mn = min([37, 32, 38, 26]) = 26`

3. **Final Output**:
   - `print('%d %d' % (mn, mx))` prints `26 37`

Clearly, the output `26 37` does not match the expected values `28 41`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
