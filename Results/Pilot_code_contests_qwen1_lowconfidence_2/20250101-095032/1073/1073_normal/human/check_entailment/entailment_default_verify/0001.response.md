Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program does not correctly calculate the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the overall logic for calculating `mn` and `mx` do not align with the problem requirements. For instance, for the input `n = 4`, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of stolen hay blocks as 26 instead of 28, and the maximum number as 37 instead of 41. The logic within the loops and the computation in `func_1` do not correctly reflect the conditions described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
