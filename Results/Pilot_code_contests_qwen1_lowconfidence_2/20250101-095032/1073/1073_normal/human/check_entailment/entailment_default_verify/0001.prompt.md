You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored A·B·C hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped A layers high. Each layer had B rows and each row had C blocks.

At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (A - 1) × (B - 2) × (C - 2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1 × 1 × 1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted n hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers A, B и C.

Given number n, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.

Input

The only line contains integer n from the problem's statement (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).

Output

Print space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.

Note that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

Output

Output

48 105

Note

Let's consider the first sample test. If initially Sam has a parallelepiped consisting of 32 = 2 × 4 × 4 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4 = (2 - 1) × (4 - 2) × (4 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32 - 4 = 28 hay blocks. If Sam initially had a parallelepiped consisting of 45 = 5 × 3 × 3 hay blocks in his barn, then after the theft the barn has 4 = (5 - 1) × (3 - 2) × (3 - 2) hay blocks left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 45 - 4 = 41 hay blocks. No other variants of the blocks' initial arrangement (that leave Sam with exactly 4 blocks after the theft) can permit the thieves to steal less than 28 or more than 41 blocks.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

n = eval(sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split()[0])
if n == 1:
    print('17 17')
    exit(0)
r = int(math.sqrt(float(n))) + 1
r3 = int(10 ** (math.log10(float(n)) / 3)) - 1
mx = 8 * n + 9
mn = mx
while r > 0:
    if n % r == 0:
        A = r
        m = n / r
        B = int(math.sqrt(float(m))) + 1
        while B > 0:
            if m % B == 0:
                C = m / B
                mn = min([mn, func_1(A, B, C), func_1(B, A, C), func_1(C, B, A)])
            B -= 1
    r -= 1
print('%d %d' % (mn, mx))

def func_1(A, B, C):
    return 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the overall logic for calculating `mn` and `mx` do not align with the problem description.

For instance, consider the input `n = 4`. According to the problem description, the minimally possible number of stolen hay blocks is 28 and the maximally possible number is 41. However, the program incorrectly calculates these values.

To illustrate, let's walk through the program's logic for `n = 4`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n = 4`
   - `r = int(math.sqrt(float(n))) + 1 = 2`
   - `r3 = int(10 ** (math.log10(float(n)) / 3)) - 1 = 0`
   - `mx = 8 * n + 9 = 37`

2. **Loop for `r`**:
   - When `r = 2`:
     - `m = n / r = 2`
     - `B = int(math.sqrt(float(m))) + 1 = 2`
     - While loop for `B`:
       - When `B = 2`:
         - `C = m / B = 1`
         - `mn = min([mn, func_1(A, B, C), func_1(B, A, C), func_1(C, B, A)])`
         - `func_1(A, B, C) = 2 * (2 + 1) * (2 + 1 + 2) + 2 * 1 = 2 * 3 * 5 + 2 = 32`
         - `func_1(B, A, C) = 2 * (2 + 1) * (2 + 2 + 2) + 2 * 1 = 2 * 3 * 6 + 2 = 38`
         - `func_1(C, B, A) = 2 * (1 + 1) * (2 + 2 + 2) + 1 * 2 = 2 * 2 * 6 + 2 = 26`
         - `mn = min([37, 32, 38, 26]) = 26`

3. **Final Output**:
   - `print('%d %d' % (mn, mx))` prints `26 37`

Clearly, the output `26 37` does not match the expected values `28 41`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `A`, `B`, and `C`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq (A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) \leq n\). After performing the computation, it returns the value of the expression `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`. This expression involves multiplying and adding the given parameters according to a specific formula. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that the input values satisfy the initial condition \(1 \leq (A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) \leq n\). If this condition is not met, the function will still compute the expression using the provided values, though it might not have the intended behavior in such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
