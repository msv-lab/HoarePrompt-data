Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number correctly. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum number of stolen blocks using the formula `8 * n + 9`, which is incorrect for prime numbers. Additionally, the program does not compute the minimum number of stolen blocks correctly for prime numbers. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` computes a specific expression involving the parameters `A`, `B`, and `C`, but it does not address the edge case of prime numbers. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description for certain inputs, making the original assessment correct.
