Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` computes a value unrelated to the actual number of stolen hay blocks. Instead, it calculates a value based on the dimensions of the remaining hay blocks, which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the number of stolen blocks.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to find the dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) of the original parallelepiped such that \((A-1) \times (B-2) \times (C-2) = n\). The program should then calculate the total number of blocks in the original parallelepiped \(A \times B \times C\) and subtract \(n\) to get the number of stolen blocks. The program should also consider the different permutations of dimensions to find both the minimum and maximum possible number of stolen blocks.

The current implementation does not properly handle this logic and instead computes an unrelated expression, leading to incorrect results for various inputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
