Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Stolen Blocks:**
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum number of stolen hay blocks based on a specific formula and conditions, but it does not ensure that the conditions `(A-1) * (B-2) * (C-2) = n` are met for the calculated values of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
   - The function `func_1` computes `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C`, but this formula does not directly relate to the problem statement. The problem requires finding the minimum and maximum possible values of `(A-1) * (B-2) * (C-2)`, which is not what `func_1` is doing.

2. **Logic for Finding `A`, `B`, and `C`:**
   - The logic for finding `A`, `B`, and `C` is flawed. The program attempts to iterate over possible values of `A` and `B` to find valid dimensions, but it does not ensure that the product `(A-1) * (B-2) * (C-2)` matches `n` accurately.
   - The program uses a fixed formula `2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C` to compute the minimum possible number of stolen blocks, which does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires finding the exact dimensions that would result in `n` blocks remaining after the theft.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, it does not correctly identify when `n` cannot be expressed as `(A-1) * (B-2) * (C-2)` for any positive integers `A`, `B`, and `C`.
   - The program assumes that the computed values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will always satisfy the condition, but it does not validate this assumption.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Find all possible factorizations of `n + x` where `x` is the number of stolen blocks.
2. Ensure that the factorization fits the form `(A-1) * (B-2) * (C-2) = n`.
3. Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of `x` based on these factorizations.

Here is a corrected approach:
```python
import math

n = int(input())
if n == 1:
    print('17 17')
    exit()

min_stolen = float('inf')
max_stolen = 0

# Iterate over possible values of (A-1), (B-2), (C-2)
for i in range(1, int((n+1)**(1/3)) + 1):
    if (n + i) % i == 0:
        j = (n + i) // i
        for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(j)) + 1):
            if j % k == 0:
                l = j // k
                A = i + 1
                B = k + 2
                C = l + 2
                stolen = 2 * (A + 1) * (B + C + 2) + B * C - n
                min_stolen = min(min_stolen, stolen)
                max_stolen = max(max_stolen, stolen)

print(f'{min_stolen} {max_stolen}')
```

This solution correctly finds the minimum and maximum possible number of stolen hay blocks by iterating over all possible factorizations and ensuring they fit the required form.
