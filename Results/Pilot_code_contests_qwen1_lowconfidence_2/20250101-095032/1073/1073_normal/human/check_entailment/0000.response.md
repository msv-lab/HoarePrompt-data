Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is a prime number. In such cases, the dimensions `A`, `B`, and `C` cannot be easily derived from `n` using the given approach. Let's consider the following example:

For `n = 7`, the program will fail because 7 is a prime number. The correct answer should be:
- Minimum stolen blocks: 47
- Maximum stolen blocks: 65

However, the program will output:
```
14 8*n+9
```

This happens because the program uses the formula `8*n + 9` to calculate the maximum number of stolen blocks, which is incorrect for prime numbers. Additionally, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of stolen blocks for prime numbers.

To fix this, the program needs to handle prime numbers separately and provide the correct minimum and maximum values.
