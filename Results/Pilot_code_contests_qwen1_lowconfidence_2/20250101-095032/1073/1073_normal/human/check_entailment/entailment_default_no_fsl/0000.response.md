Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks for every potential case. Specifically, the program uses a heuristic approach to find possible dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) of the original hay stack, but it does not guarantee that it will find the optimal solutions for both the minimum and maximum number of stolen blocks.

Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Calculation of Dimensions**: The program attempts to find possible dimensions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) by iterating over possible values of \(A\) and \(B\) and checking if they divide \(n\). However, it does not systematically explore all possible factorizations of \(n\) that could correspond to different dimensions of the original stack.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` computes the number of stolen blocks based on the formula \(2 \times (A + 1) \times (B + C + 2) + B \times C\). However, this formula is derived from a specific arrangement of blocks and may not cover all possible configurations where the thieves could have stolen blocks from the front, back, top, and sides.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, if \(n\) is a prime number, the program might not correctly identify the dimensions that minimize or maximize the number of stolen blocks.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

- **Input**: `12`

According to the problem, the minimized and maximized number of stolen blocks should be 48 and 105, respectively. However, the program fails to produce these results consistently.

- **Example Calculation**:
  - If the original stack had dimensions \(3 \times 3 \times 5\), the remaining stack would be \((3-1) \times (3-2) \times (5-2) = 2 \times 1 \times 3 = 6\) blocks. Thus, the number of stolen blocks would be \(3 \times 3 \times 5 - 6 = 45 - 6 = 39\).
  - Another configuration could be \(2 \times 3 \times 3\), resulting in \( (2-1) \times (3-2) \times (3-2) = 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1\) block remaining, and thus \(2 \times 3 \times 3 - 1 = 18 - 1 = 17\) stolen blocks.

Since the program does not ensure it explores all possible configurations, it fails to provide the correct minimally and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
