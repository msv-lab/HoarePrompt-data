The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` containing integers that are either 1 or 2. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, with elements ordered based on the return values of the `getKey` function applied to each element. If the `getKey` function is not defined or does not handle all possible inputs (e.g., non-integer values), the behavior of sorting is undefined. Potential edge cases include lists that are already sorted, empty lists, and lists containing only one element. Additionally, if the `getKey` function does not provide distinct keys for the integers 1 and 2, the relative order of these elements might not change during the sorting process.
