The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from stdin, expecting an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers (either 1 or 2). It then converts these integers into an integer type using the `map` function and returns a map object. Potential edge cases include invalid input such as non-integer values or a mix of 1s and 2s. If the input does not follow the expected format, the function will still attempt to convert the input but may produce unexpected results or errors.
