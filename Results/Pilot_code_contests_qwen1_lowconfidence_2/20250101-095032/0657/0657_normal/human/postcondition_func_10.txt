The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and returns a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2, representing the binary digits of `n`. The function converts the integer `n` to its string representation, then iterates through each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer (which will be either '1' or '2'), and finally returns a list of these integers. This process handles all integers within the specified range, including the smallest (1) and largest (200,000) values, and correctly identifies each binary digit of `n` as either 1 or 2, as per the problem statement.
