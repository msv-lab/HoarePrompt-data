The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input, which should contain an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers, each being either 1 or 2. It then returns a string containing these `n` space-separated integers. There are no additional operations performed by the function other than reading the input and returning it. Potential edge cases include the input not conforming to the expected format (e.g., missing integers or non-integer values), in which case the function would still return whatever input is provided without validation.
