The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer representing the number of number tiles in the bag. The function ensures that the input is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. If the user inputs a valid integer within this range, the function returns this integer. If the user inputs an invalid value (i.e., outside the specified range or non-integer), the function will continue to prompt the user until a valid integer is entered. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, which represents the number of number tiles in the bag.
