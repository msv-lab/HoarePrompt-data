None of the variables in the function `func_2()` are described in the context provided. The function does not take any parameters and returns an integer obtained from user input. However, based on the problem description, the integer input should represent the number of number tiles in the bag, which implies it should be an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
