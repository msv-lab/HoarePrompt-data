`two` is assigned the value of `l.count(2)`. This means `two` will hold the count of the number 2 in the list `l`. The count of 2's in `l` is determined by counting the occurrences of the value 2 in `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `l` is the return value of `func_5()`, `a` is a list containing 200,000 elements, each being either 1 or 2, `s` is an empty list, `one` is the count of the number of 1's in the list `l`, `two` is the count of the number of 2's in the list `l`**
