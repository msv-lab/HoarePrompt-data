`p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends the value of `p[-1] + 2` to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not defined, so it will be created as a list. The last element of `p` before appending (`p[-1]`) is the last element added, which is 2 (since `s` is initially `[2]` and `p` starts with this value). Adding 2 to `p[-1]` gives 4, so `p` becomes `[2, 4]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is [2], `p` is [2, 4]**
