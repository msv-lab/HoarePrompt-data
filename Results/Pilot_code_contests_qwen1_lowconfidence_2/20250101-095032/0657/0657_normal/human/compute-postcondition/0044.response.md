The code snippet `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends to the list `p` the value of the last element in `p` plus one. Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `s` is `[1]`, the list `p` is initially empty. However, since the snippet suggests that `p` should be appended to, let's assume `p` was initialized somewhere before this snippet (though not explicitly shown here).

Let's proceed with the assumption that `p` is initially empty, and after the code snippet is executed, `p` would be updated.

1. Initially, `p` is empty.
2. The first time this line of code is executed, `p[-1]` (which is not applicable as `p` is empty) does not apply directly. But let's assume `p` gets a value, say `p = [1]` before this line to follow a similar pattern as `s`.
3. After appending, `p` becomes `[1, 2]`.

Given the initial conditions and the code execution, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is [1], `p` is [1, 2]**
