`p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends the value of the last element in `p` plus one to the list `p`. Since the last element of `p` is odd, adding 1 to it will result in an even number. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- The last element of `p` is now even (since it was odd and 1 was added)
- `two` is 0
- `s` is `[1]`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of `p` is even, and `two` is 0; `s` is `[1]`**
