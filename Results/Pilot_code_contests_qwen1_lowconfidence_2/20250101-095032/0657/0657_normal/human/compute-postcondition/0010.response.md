To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can start and continue. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the required conditions:

1. **Variable `n`**: The loop starts from `i = 1` and continues as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at all.
   
2. **Variable `i`**: Initially, `i` should be set to 1 because the loop starts from 1 (inclusive) and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `l` is the return value of `func_5()`
- `a` is a list containing 200,000 elements, each being either 1 or 2
- `s` is a list containing the element `2`
- `one` is the count of the number of 1's in the list `l` after adjustments
- `two` is the count of the number of 2's in the list `l` after adjustments minus 1
- `p` is `[2]`

The relevant variables here are `n` and `i`. Since `i` starts from 1, we need to ensure `n > 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
