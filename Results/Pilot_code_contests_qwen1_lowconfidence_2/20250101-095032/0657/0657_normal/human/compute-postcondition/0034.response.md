The code snippet `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` affects the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, but based on the operation, we infer that `p` is a list. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `s` is `[1]`, we need to determine the updated state of `p`.

Since `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends the value of the last element plus one to the list `p`, and assuming `p` starts as an empty list (as no initial value is provided and the operation suggests it is being initialized here), after this line of code, `p` will be `[0]` because `p[-1]` would initially be 0 (the default first element of an empty list when indexed from the end).

However, since the initial state does not specify `p`, and given the code initializes it implicitly, the only thing we can deduce is that `p` now contains `[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is `[1]`, `p` is `[0]`**
