`p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends the value of `p[-1] + 1` to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not defined, so let's assume it starts as an empty list and then is updated by this line of code. Given that `p[-1]` would refer to the last element in the list, and since the list starts empty, we first need to initialize `p` with the first element before appending.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 3
- `s` is [1]

Since `p` is not initially defined, we can infer that before this line of code, `p` might have been initialized to `[1]` (assuming it follows the same pattern as `s`). However, since no such initialization is explicitly mentioned, we treat `p` as starting as an empty list.

The code `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` would append `1 + 1` (since `p[-1]` is the last element in `p`, which is initially non-existent, we consider the operation to add 1 directly) to `p`. Thus, `p` becomes `[1]` followed by `2`, making `p` equal to `[1, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `s` is [1], `p` is [1, 2]**
