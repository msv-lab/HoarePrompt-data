`s` is a list, and the code appends the value `2` to it. The value of `n` remains greater than 2, and `i` remains 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `s` is a list containing `[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `s` is a list containing `[2]`**
