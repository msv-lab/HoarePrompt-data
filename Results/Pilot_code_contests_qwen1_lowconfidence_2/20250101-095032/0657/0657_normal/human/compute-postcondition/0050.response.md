The code appends the value of the last element in list `p` plus 1 to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not defined, so it must be inferred that `p` is being initialized and appended to within this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 3
- `s` is `[1]`

Since `p` is not defined initially, it is being created and the first element is set to `p[-1] + 1`. As `p` just started, `p[-1]` is equivalent to the first element of an empty list, which does not exist until we append something. Therefore, `p[-1]` will default to 0 (as per Python's list indexing rules).

So, `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` translates to `p.append(0 + 1)`, appending `1` to `p`.

After this operation:
- `n` remains greater than 2
- `i` remains 3
- `s` remains `[1]`
- `p` becomes `[1]`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is 3; `s` is [1]; `p` is [1]**
