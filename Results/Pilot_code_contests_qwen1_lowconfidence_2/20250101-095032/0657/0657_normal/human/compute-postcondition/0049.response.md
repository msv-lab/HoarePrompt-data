`s` is a list that is being modified by appending the value 1 to it. The value of `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 3, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 3; `s` is a list containing the element 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is 3; `s` is [1]**
