The code `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends the next consecutive integer (which is `p[-1] + 1`) to the list `p`. Given that `p` ends with an even number, appending `p[-1] + 1` means the new last element in `p` will be an odd number. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `p` is now a list where the last element is an odd number (specifically, the previous last element plus one)
- `one` is not 0
- `s` is `[1]`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list with its last element being an odd number, and `one` is not 0; `s` is `[1]`**
