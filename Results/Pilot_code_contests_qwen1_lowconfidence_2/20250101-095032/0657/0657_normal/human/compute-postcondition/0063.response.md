Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the if condition. If `p[-1] % 2 == 0` (i.e., `two != 0`), then `s` is [2] and `p` is an empty list. If `p[-1] % 2 != 0` (i.e., `one != 0`), then `s` is [1] and `p` is [1]. Otherwise, `s` is [2, 4] and `p` is an empty list.***
