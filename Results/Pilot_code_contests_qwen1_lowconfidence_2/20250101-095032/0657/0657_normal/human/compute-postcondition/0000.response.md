The code `n = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to `n`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `n`. However, we know that initially, `n` was an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000`. After executing the line of code, the value of `n` is updated to whatever `func_2()` returns, which must still fall within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000`.

The list `l` remains unchanged since no operation involving `l` is performed in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is now the return value of `func_2()`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `l` is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2.**
