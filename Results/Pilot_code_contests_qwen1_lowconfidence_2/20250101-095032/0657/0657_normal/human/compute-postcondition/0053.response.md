The code `p.append(p[-1] + 2)` affects the list `p`. Initially, `p` is not defined, but given the context, it can be inferred that `p` is the same as `s` since no other list is mentioned. The initial state is that `s` is a list containing `[2]`.

- `s` is initially `[2]`.
- After `p.append(p[-1] + 2)`, `p[-1]` refers to the last element of `p`, which is `2`. Adding `2` to `2` gives `4`. So, `p` becomes `[2, 4]`.

Since `p` is the same as `s` in this context, `s` also becomes `[2, 4]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `s` is [2, 4]**
