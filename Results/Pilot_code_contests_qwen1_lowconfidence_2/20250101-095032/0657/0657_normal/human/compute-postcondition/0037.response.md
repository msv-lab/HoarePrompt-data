The code `p.append(p[-1] + 2)` is executed, which appends the value of the last element in the list `p` plus 2 to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is `[2]`, so `p[-1]` is 2, and appending `2 + 2` (which is 4) to `p` results in `p` becoming `[2, 4]`.

The other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s` is `[2]`; `p` is `[2, 4]`**
