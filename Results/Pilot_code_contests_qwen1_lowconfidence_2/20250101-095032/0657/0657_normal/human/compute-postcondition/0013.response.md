`s` is a list that is appended with the value `1`. The value of `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers with its last element being an even number, and `one` is not 0. After executing the code, `s` will have the value `[1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers with its last element being an even number, and `one` is not 0; `s` is `[1]`**
