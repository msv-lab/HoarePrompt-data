Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1. If the last element of `p` is odd, then `one` is decremented by 1, `s` is set to `[1]`, and the last element of `p` is now an odd number. Otherwise, `one` is set to 0, `s` is set to `[2]`, and the last element of `p` is increased by 2. If the last element of `p` is odd + 2 and `s` contains at least one element which is 2, then `two` is decremented by 1 and the last element of `p` becomes odd. Otherwise, if the last element of `p` is even and `two` is 0, then `one` is decremented by 1 and `s` is set to `[1]`.***
