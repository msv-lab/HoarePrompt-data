The function `func_14` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and another parameter `l`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information, so it might be expected to return a value derived from processing the list `l` based on the integer `n`. However, based solely on the given information, the function's return value is not specified.

Given the constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function `func_14` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 200,000 and a list `l` containing integers that are either 1 or 2, and then perform some operation on `l` based on `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list `l` of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2, and processes `l` based on `n`.**
