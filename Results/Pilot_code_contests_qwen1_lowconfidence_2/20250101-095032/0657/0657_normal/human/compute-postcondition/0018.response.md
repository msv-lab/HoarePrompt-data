`p` has its last element updated to be the last element plus 2. Since the last element of `p` is an even number, adding 2 to it results in another even number. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers with its last element being an even number + 2, `one` is 0, `s` is a list containing 2**
