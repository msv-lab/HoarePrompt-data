`one` is decremented by 1, which means `one` is now one less than its original value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list with its last element being an odd number, and `one` is now `one - 1`; `s` is `[1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list with its last element being an odd number, and `one` is now `one - 1`; `s` is `[1]`**
