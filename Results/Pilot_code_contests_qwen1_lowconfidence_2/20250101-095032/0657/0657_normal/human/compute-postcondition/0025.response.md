`two` is decremented by 1. The value of `two` was not 0, so it is now `two - 1`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, the last element of `p` is odd + 2, and `s` is a list containing at least one element which is 2; the value of `two` is `two - 1`.**
