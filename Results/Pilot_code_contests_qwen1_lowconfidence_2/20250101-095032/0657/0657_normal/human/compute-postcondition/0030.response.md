Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the last element of `p` is odd + 2 and `s` contains at least one element which is 2, then `two` is decremented by 1 and the last element of `p` becomes odd. Otherwise, if the last element of `p` is even and `two` is 0, then `one` is decremented by 1 and `s` is set to `[1]`.***
