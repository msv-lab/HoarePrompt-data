`s` is a list that now contains the element `2` because `s.append(2)` adds `2` to the list `s`. The values of the other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s` is `[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s` is `[2]`**
