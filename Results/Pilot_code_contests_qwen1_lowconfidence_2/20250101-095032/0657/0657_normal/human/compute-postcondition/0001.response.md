The code `l = func_5()` assigns the return value of `func_5()` to `l`. Since the exact implementation of `func_5()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value or contents of `l`. However, we know that initially, `l` was a list where each element was either 1 or 2. After executing the line of code, the value of `l` is updated to whatever `func_5()` returns, which must still consist of elements that are either 1 or 2.

The value of `n` remains the same as the return value of `func_2()`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is now the return value of `func_2()`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `l` is a list where each element is either 1 or 2, and is now updated to the return value of `func_5()`.**
