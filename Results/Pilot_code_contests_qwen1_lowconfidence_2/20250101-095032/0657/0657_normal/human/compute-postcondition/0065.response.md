The code `func_1(*s)` calls a function `func_1` with arguments unpacked from the tuple `s`. However, since `func_1` is not defined and the contents of `s` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine what changes, if any, this function call will make to the variables.

Given the lack of specific information about `func_1` and `s`, the only thing we can definitively say is that `s` is unpacked into the function call and `func_1` might modify its arguments or perform some operations, but without further details, we cannot specify those changes.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, as no specific modifications or values can be derived from the given information.

Output State: **same as the initial state**
