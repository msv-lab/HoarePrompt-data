Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If the last element of `p` is odd, then:
  - `one` is decremented by 1.
  - `s` is set to `[1]`.
  - The last element of `p` is now an odd number.
- Otherwise:
  - `one` is set to 0.
  - `s` is set to `[2]`.
  - The last element of `p` is increased by 2.

### Given Loop
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **First Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, the first iteration occurs when `i` is 1.
   - The loop body is not given, but we know that the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - After the first iteration (where `i` is 1), `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 2 (since `i` is incremented to 2).

### Updated State

- `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).
- `i` is 2.

### Final Answer

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**.
