The code snippet appends the value of the last element in the list `p` plus 2 to the list `p`. Since the initial state does not explicitly define the list `p`, we assume `p` is initially an empty list before this operation.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Initially, `p` is an empty list.
2. The code snippet appends `p[-1] + 2` to `p`. Since `p` is currently empty, `p[-1]` would refer to the last element of an empty list, which is undefined. However, in the context of appending, we consider the operation to be invalid because there is no last element in an empty list.

Given this, the code effectively does nothing to `p` because appending to an empty list with an undefined last element is not possible without initializing the list first.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `s` is [2], `p` is an empty list**
