The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. The function achieves this by evaluating the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`. This expression simplifies to checking if `x` is 0 because:
- If `x` is 0, both parts of the expression evaluate to `False`, resulting in `True`.
- If `x` is any positive integer, `x & (x - 1)` will be `0` (since `(x - 1)` will have one less bit set than `x`), making the entire expression evaluate to `False`.
Thus, the function correctly identifies whether `x` is 0 or not. There are no potential edge cases beyond the general cases where `x` can be 0 or any positive integer. The function behaves as intended without any missing logic.
