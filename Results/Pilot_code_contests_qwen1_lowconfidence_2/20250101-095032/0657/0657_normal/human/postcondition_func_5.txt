The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be either a tuple or a list containing at least one element. The function returns the first element of `item`. The first element is assumed to be of a type that can be compared and sorted. This function does not modify the input `item` and only accesses its first element. If `item` is empty or not a tuple or list, the function does not handle these cases and will raise an `IndexError` or a `TypeError` respectively.
