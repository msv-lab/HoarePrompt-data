You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function takes a variable-length argument list `args` containing integers and a dictionary `kwargs` with optional parameters 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. It writes the elements of `args` to the specified `file` (defaulting to standard output) separated by the byte string `sep` (defaulting to a space). After writing the last element, it appends the `end` string (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the output buffer if requested. The function does not return any value.

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be that the elements of `args` have been written to `file` (which defaults to standard output), separated by `sep` (defaulting to a space), followed by the `end` string (defaulting to a newline). If `flush` was set to `True` in `kwargs`, the output buffer will be flushed. If `sep` was not provided, it defaults to a space. If `end` was not provided, it defaults to a newline. If `flush` was not provided, it defaults to `False`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `args` is empty, no elements will be written.
- If `sep` is not provided, it will default to a space.
- If `end` is not provided, it will default to a newline.
- If `flush` is not provided, it will default to `False`.

Missing functionality: The function does not handle cases where `args` contains non-integer values, although the provided code only expects integers. Additionally, the function does not validate that `sep` is indeed a byte string if provided.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer representing the number of number tiles in the bag. The function ensures that the input is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. If the user inputs a valid integer within this range, the function returns this integer. If the user inputs an invalid value (i.e., outside the specified range or non-integer), the function will continue to prompt the user until a valid integer is entered. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, which represents the number of number tiles in the bag.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return str(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input, which should contain an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers, each being either 1 or 2. It then returns a string containing these `n` space-separated integers. There are no additional operations performed by the function other than reading the input and returning it. Potential edge cases include the input not conforming to the expected format (e.g., missing integers or non-integer values), in which case the function would still return whatever input is provided without validation.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from stdin, expecting an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers (either 1 or 2). It then converts these integers into an integer type using the `map` function and returns a map object. Potential edge cases include invalid input such as non-integer values or a mix of 1s and 2s. If the input does not follow the expected format, the function will still attempt to convert the input but may produce unexpected results or errors.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_4())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` takes no parameters and returns a list processed by `func_4()`. The input to `func_4()` is a list of integers, each being either 1 or 2, with the constraint that the length of the list is between 1 and 200,000. `func_4()` processes this list according to its own rules, and `func_5` returns the resulting list. Since the annotations mention that the function returns a list generated by `func_4()`, and considering the constraints on the input, the final state of the program after `func_5` concludes is that it returns a list of integers processed by `func_4()`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code provided, but typically, such functions might handle edge cases like an empty input list or invalid inputs, although these are not specified here.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be either a tuple or a list containing at least one element. The function returns the first element of `item`. The first element is assumed to be of a type that can be compared and sorted. This function does not modify the input `item` and only accesses its first element. If `item` is empty or not a tuple or list, the function does not handle these cases and will raise an `IndexError` or a `TypeError` respectively.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` containing integers that are either 1 or 2. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, with elements ordered based on the return values of the `getKey` function applied to each element. If the `getKey` function is not defined or does not handle all possible inputs (e.g., non-integer values), the behavior of sorting is undefined. Potential edge cases include lists that are already sorted, empty lists, and lists containing only one element. Additionally, if the `getKey` function does not provide distinct keys for the integers 1 and 2, the relative order of these elements might not change during the sorting process.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and `num` is an integer either 1 or 2. After executing the function, it returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, otherwise it returns `False`. The function achieves this by evaluating the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`. This expression simplifies to checking if `x` is 0 because:
- If `x` is 0, both parts of the expression evaluate to `False`, resulting in `True`.
- If `x` is any positive integer, `x & (x - 1)` will be `0` (since `(x - 1)` will have one less bit set than `x`), making the entire expression evaluate to `False`.
Thus, the function correctly identifies whether `x` is 0 or not. There are no potential edge cases beyond the general cases where `x` can be 0 or any positive integer. The function behaves as intended without any missing logic.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{200000}\). It converts `n` into its binary representation and returns a string without the '0b' prefix. The function ensures that the input `n` is a valid non-negative integer within the specified range. The returned string is the binary representation of `n`. If `n` is 0, the function correctly returns the empty string `''`.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and returns a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2, representing the binary digits of `n`. The function converts the integer `n` to its string representation, then iterates through each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer (which will be either '1' or '2'), and finally returns a list of these integers. This process handles all integers within the specified range, including the smallest (1) and largest (200,000) values, and correctly identifies each binary digit of `n` as either 1 or 2, as per the problem statement.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p1
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is an integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is a positive integer. It returns `res`, which is the result of repeatedly squaring `x` and multiplying it to `res` whenever `y` is odd, all taken modulo `p`. Specifically, the function computes \( res = 1 \times x^{2^j} \mod p \) for each odd `y` in the range from the original value of `y` down to 1, with the final result also taken modulo `p`. 

The function handles the following scenarios:
- If `y` is 0, the function simply returns 1 (the initial value of `res`).
- If `y` is even, the function processes the next bit of `y` without changing `res`.
- If `y` is odd, the function updates `res` by multiplying it with \( x^{2^k} \mod p \), where \( k \) is the number of times the loop has executed.

There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the standard behavior described above.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (where \(x \geq 0\) and \(y > 0\)). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:

    func_1(*s)
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on the values returned by `func_2()` and `func_5()`. It processes these values to generate a list `s` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000`) based on counts of 1s and 2s in the list `l`. The list `s` is constructed by alternating between 1s and 2s according to the counts of 1s and 2s available. If the counts of 1s and 2s are equal, the list `s` is generated by alternating starting with 2s. If the counts are unequal, the list `s` is constructed to use up the available 1s before 2s or vice versa. The function then calls `func_1(s)` with the generated list `s`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
