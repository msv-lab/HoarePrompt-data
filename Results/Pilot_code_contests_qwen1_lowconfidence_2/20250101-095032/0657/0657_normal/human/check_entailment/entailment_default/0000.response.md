Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly maximize the number of prefix sums that are prime numbers. The code attempts to construct a sequence based on the counts of 1s and 2s in the input list, but it does not ensure that the prefix sums are prime. Instead, it alternates between 1s and 2s in a way that does not guarantee the maximum number of prime prefix sums.

For instance, consider the input `1 1 1 2 2`. The code generates the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 6, 8]`, which has only one prime prefix sum (2). However, the optimal sequence would be `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2]`, which gives the prefix sums `[1, 3, 4, 5, 7]`, and four out of five prefix sums are prime.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to strategically place the 1s and 2s to maximize the number of prime prefix sums. This involves more complex logic to determine the optimal placement of numbers, ensuring that the prefix sums remain prime as much as possible.
