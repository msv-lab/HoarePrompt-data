Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always maximize the number of prefix sums that are prime numbers. Specifically, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
3
2 1 2
```

The expected output would be a permutation that maximizes the number of prime prefix sums. One such permutation could be `1 2 1`, which gives the prefix sums `1, 3, 4`. Here, the prefix sums `1` and `3` are prime, achieving 2 prime prefix sums.

However, the current implementation always appends `2` to the beginning of the list `s` before processing the rest of the input. This means the program might not always produce the optimal permutation.

In the given example:
- The program starts with `s = [2]`.
- It then processes the remaining elements: `1, 2, 1`.

The sequence generated is `[2, 1, 2, 1]`, which results in the prefix sums `2, 3, 5, 6`. Here, only `2` and `3` are prime, achieving only 2 prime prefix sums. 

However, a better permutation would be `[1, 2, 1]`, which achieves 2 prime prefix sums (`1, 3`).

Since the program does not always generate the optimal permutation, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
