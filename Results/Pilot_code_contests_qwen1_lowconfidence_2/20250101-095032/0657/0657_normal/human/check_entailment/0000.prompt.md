You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
