Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements. Specifically, the code generates the `red` and `blue` grids in a way that does not ensure the 4-connectivity of the red and blue cells separately. 

- For the `red` grid, the code alternates `#` and `.` starting from `#`. This means that while the `red` cells form a pattern, they do not necessarily maintain 4-connectivity across rows and columns.
- For the `blue` grid, the pattern is similar but with the order of `#` and `.` flipped between even and odd rows. Again, this does not guarantee 4-connectivity.

Given the problem statement, the red cells must form a 4-connected component, and the blue cells must also form a 4-connected component. The provided code does not enforce these conditions. Therefore, it is incorrect.
