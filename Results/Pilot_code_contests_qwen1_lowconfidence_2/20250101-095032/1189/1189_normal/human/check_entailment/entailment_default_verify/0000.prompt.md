You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke and Ciel went to a strange stationery store. Each of them got a transparent graph paper with H rows and W columns.

Snuke painted some of the cells red in his paper. Here, the cells painted red were 4-connected, that is, it was possible to traverse from any red cell to any other red cell, by moving to vertically or horizontally adjacent red cells only.

Ciel painted some of the cells blue in her paper. Here, the cells painted blue were 4-connected.

Afterwards, they precisely overlaid the two sheets in the same direction. Then, the intersection of the red cells and the blue cells appeared purple.

You are given a matrix of letters a_{ij} (1≤i≤H, 1≤j≤W) that describes the positions of the purple cells. If the cell at the i-th row and j-th column is purple, then a_{ij} is `#`, otherwise a_{ij} is `.`. Here, it is guaranteed that no outermost cell is purple. That is, if i=1, H or j = 1, W, then a_{ij} is `.`.

Find a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation described. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Constraints

* 3≤H,W≤500
* a_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* If i=1,H or j=1,W, then a_{ij} is `.`.
* At least one of a_{ij} is `#`.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
a_{11}...a_{1W}
:
a_{H1}...a_{HW}


Output

Print a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation, as follows:

* The first H lines should describe the positions of the red cells.
* The following 1 line should be empty.
* The following H lines should describe the positions of the blue cells.



The description of the positions of the red or blue cells should follow the format of the description of the positions of the purple cells.

    red = []
    blue = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = raw_input()
        r = ['#']
        b = ['.']
        for j in range(1, m - 1):
            if row[j] == '#':
                r.append('#')
                b.append('#')
            elif i % 2 == 0:
                r.append('#')
                b.append('.')
            else:
                r.append('.')
                b.append('#')
        r.append('.')
        b.append('#')
        red.append(''.join(r))
        blue.append(''.join(b))
    for r in red:
        print(r)
    for b in blue:
        print(b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to generate a pair of sets of red and blue cells such that their intersection matches the given purple cells. However, the logic used in the program does not guarantee that the generated red and blue cells will form 4-connected components.

For example, consider the input:

```
5 5
.....
.#.#.
.....
.#.#.
.....
```

The expected output should be something like:

```
.....
#####
#....
#####
.....

.###.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.....
```

However, the given program generates:

```
.....
#####
#....
#####
.....

.###.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.....
```

This output is incorrect because the red cells (`#####`) and blue cells (`###.`) do not form 4-connected components. The blue cells are not connected, violating the requirement that the blue cells must be 4-connected.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts two parameters `H` and `W`, which represent the height and width of a grid, respectively. It processes a grid represented by `H` rows and `W` columns, where each cell can be either `#` or `.`. The function constructs two modified grids: one with alternating `#` and `.` starting from `#` (referred to as `red`), and another with alternating `#` and `.` starting from `#` but excluding the last column (referred to as `blue`). After processing, it prints both modified grids. The function does not return anything but modifies and prints the grid according to the specified patterns.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
