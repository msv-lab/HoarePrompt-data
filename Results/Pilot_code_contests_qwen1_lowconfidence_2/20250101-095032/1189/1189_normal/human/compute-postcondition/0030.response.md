The code appends `'#'` to the list `r`. Given the initial state, `r` is initially either `['#']` if `row[j]` is `#` or `['.', '#']` if `row[j]` is `.` (since `j` is `m-2` and based on the description). The code does not affect the values of `row`, `m`, or `j`.

Therefore, the updated list `r` will have an additional `'#'` appended to its initial value.

Output State: **`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m-2`, `r` is either `['#', '#']` if `row[j]` is `#` or `['.', '#', '#']` if `row[j]` is `.`**
