`b` is appended with the value `'.'`. The value of `m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, and `r` is a list with one additional element `'#'`. The append operation modifies `b`, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, and `r` is a list with one additional element `'#'`; `b` is appended with `'.'`**
