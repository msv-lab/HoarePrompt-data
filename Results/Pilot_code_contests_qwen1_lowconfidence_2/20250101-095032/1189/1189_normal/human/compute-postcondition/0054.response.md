`b` is appended with the value `'.'`. The value of `m` is still greater than 1, `row[j]` is not equal to `'#'`, the current value of `i` is even, and `r` is `['#']`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `row[j]` is not equal to `'#'`, the current value of `i` is even; `r` is `['#']`, `b` contains the value `'.'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `row[j]` is not equal to `'#'`, the current value of `i` is even; `r` is `['#']`, `b` contains the value `'.'`**
