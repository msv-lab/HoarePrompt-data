`blue` is a list that gets appended with the joined string of `b`. The value of `b` is a list with `m` elements where the first `m-1` elements are either `'#'` or `'.'` and the last element is `'#'`. The joined string of `b` is a string of length `m` consisting of `m-1` characters which are either `'#'` or `'.'` followed by a `'#'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the original value of `m`, `r` is a list with `m` elements where the last element is `'.'` and the rest are either `'#'` or `'.'`, `b` is a list with `m` elements where the first `m-1` elements are either `'#'` or `'.'` and the last element is `'#'`, `red` is a list where the last element is the joined string of `r`, `blue` is a list containing one additional element which is the joined string of `b`**.
