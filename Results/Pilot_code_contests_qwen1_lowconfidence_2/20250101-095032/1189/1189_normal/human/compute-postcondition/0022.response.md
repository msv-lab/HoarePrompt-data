The code `b.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `b`. Since `b` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is a new list that gets initialized with this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m-1`, and `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'`; `b` is a list containing `'#'`.**
