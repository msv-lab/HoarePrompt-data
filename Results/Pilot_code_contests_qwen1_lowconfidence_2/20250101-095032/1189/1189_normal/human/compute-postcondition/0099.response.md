Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. If `row[j]` is `#`, `r` becomes `['#', '#']` and `b` becomes `['.', '#']`. If `row[j]` is not `#`, `r` and `b` become either `['#', '#']` or `['#', '.']` depending on whether `i` is even or odd.***
