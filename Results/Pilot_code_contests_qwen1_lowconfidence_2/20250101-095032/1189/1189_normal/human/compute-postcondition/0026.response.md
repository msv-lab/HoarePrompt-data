The code appends the string `'#'` to the list `b`. The initial values of the variables are as follows: `row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m-1`, and `r` contains an additional element `'.'`. The list `b` does not initially contain any elements.

After running the line `b.append('#')`, the list `b` will have the single element `'#'`.

Output State: **`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m-1`, `r` contains an additional element '.', `b` is `['#']`**
