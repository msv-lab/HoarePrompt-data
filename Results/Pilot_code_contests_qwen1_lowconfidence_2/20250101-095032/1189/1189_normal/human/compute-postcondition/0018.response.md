Postcondition: ***`row` is the input value provided by the user, `r` is either `['#', '#']` or `['#, .']`, `b` is either `['.', '.', '.']` or `['., #']`, `m` is greater than 1, and `row[j]` is not equal to `'#'`. If the current value of `i` is even, `r` is `['#', '#']` and `b` is `['.', '.', '.']`. If the current value of `i` is not even, `r` is `['#, .']` and `b` is `['., #']`.***
