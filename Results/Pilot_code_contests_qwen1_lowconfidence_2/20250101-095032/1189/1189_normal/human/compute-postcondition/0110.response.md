`r.append('#')` adds the character `#` to the list `r`. The other variables (`m`, `j`, `row`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. The value of `i` is updated to the previous value of `i` plus 2.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, `r` is a list with an additional element `#`**
