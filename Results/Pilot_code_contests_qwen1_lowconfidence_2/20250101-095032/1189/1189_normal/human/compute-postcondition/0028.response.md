Postcondition: ***`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is `m-1`. The list `r` is modified as follows: if `row[j]` is `#`, then `r` is a list with an additional element `#`; otherwise, `r` is a list containing `#` followed by an additional element `.` if `i` is odd, or `.` if `i` is even. The list `b` always contains `#` and `.` regardless of the value of `i`.***
