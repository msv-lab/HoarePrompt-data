The code `b.append('#')` adds the string `'#'` to the list `b`. The initial state includes that `m` is greater than 1, `row[j]` is `'#'`, and `r` contains the element `'#'`. The list `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is an empty list before the code is executed.

After executing the code, `b` will contain `'#'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `row[j]` equals `'#'`; `r` contains the element `'#'`; `b` is `['#']`**
