`r` is a list, and the code appends `'#'` to the list. The value of `row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is `m-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m-1`, and `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'`.

Output State: **`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m-1`, and `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'`**
