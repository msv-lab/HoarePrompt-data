Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters `H` and `W`, which represent the height and width of a grid, respectively. It processes a grid represented by `H` rows and `W` columns, where each cell can be either `#` or `.`. The function constructs two modified grids: one with alternating `#` and `.` starting from `#` (referred to as `red`), and another with alternating `#` and `.` starting from `#` but excluding the last column (referred to as `blue`). After processing, it prints both modified grids. The function does not return anything but modifies and prints the grid according to the specified patterns.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `H` or `W` is exactly 3, the grid will have at least one border row or column, which means the constructed `red` and `blue` grids will still follow the specified pattern.
- If the grid contains only `.` within its interior, the constructed `red` and `blue` grids will also contain only `.` within their interiors.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code does not check if there are any `#` in the interior of the grid before constructing the `red` and `blue` grids. Therefore, it will always print the constructed grids regardless of whether there are any `#` in the interior or not.
