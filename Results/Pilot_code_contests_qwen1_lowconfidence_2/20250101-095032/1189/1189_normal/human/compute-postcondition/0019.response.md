Postcondition: ***`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1. If `row[j]` is `'#'`, then `r` is `['#', '#']` and `b` is `['.', '#']`. If `row[j]` is not `'#'`, then `r` is either `['#', '#']` or `['#, .']`, and `b` is either `['.', '.', '.']` or `['., #']`, depending on whether the current value of `j` is even or not.***
