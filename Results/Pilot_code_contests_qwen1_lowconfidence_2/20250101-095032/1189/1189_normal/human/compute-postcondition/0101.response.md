`r.append('#')` adds the string `'#'` to the list `r`. The values of `m`, `j`, `row`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, and `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'`.
