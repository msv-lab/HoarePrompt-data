Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`. If `i` is even, `r` contains `'#'` added to its existing elements, and `b` contains an additional `'.'` appended to it. If `i` is odd, `r` is a list containing one additional element `'.'`, and `b` is a list that includes its previous elements plus `'#'`.***
