The code `r.append('#')` appends the character `#` to the list `r`. Initially, `r` is `['#']`. After appending another `'#'`, `r` becomes `['#', '#']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `r` is `['#', '#']`, `b` is `[.]`, and the current value of `row[j]` is `#`**
