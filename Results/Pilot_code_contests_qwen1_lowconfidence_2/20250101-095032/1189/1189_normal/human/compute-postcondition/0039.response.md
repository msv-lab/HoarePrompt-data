The code `r.append('.')` adds the string `'.'` to the end of the list `r`. The initial state of `r` is a list of length `m` starting with `'#'` and the rest of the elements are either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on the value of `row[j]` and the parity of `j`. Since the list `r` is modified by appending `'.'` to it, the updated state of `r` will be the original list with an additional `'.'` at the end.

Output State: **`row` is the input value provided by the user, `r` is a list of length `m` starting with `'#'` and followed by `m-1` elements where each element is `'#'` or `'.'` depending on the value of `row[j]` and the parity of `j`, and `b` is a list of length `m` with alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, starting with `'#'`; `r` has an additional `'.'` appended to it.**
