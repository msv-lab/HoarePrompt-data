Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `r` is either `['#', '#']` or `['#', '.']`, `b` is either `['.', '.', '.']` or `['.', '#']`, and `row[j]` is not `'#'`. If `i` is even, `r` becomes `['#', '#']` and `b` becomes `['.', '.', '.']`. If `i` is odd, `r` becomes `['#', '.']` and `b` becomes `['.', '#']`.***
