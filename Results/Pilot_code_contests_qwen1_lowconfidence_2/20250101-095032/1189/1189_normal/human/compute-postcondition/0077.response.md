Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 3, `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`. If `row[2]` is `'#'`:
- If `i` is not specified, `r` is `['#', '#']` and `b` is `['#', '#']`.
- If `i` is even, `r` remains `['#', '#']` and `b` becomes `['#', '.']`.
- If `i` is odd, `r` becomes `['#', '.']` and `b` remains `['#', '#']`.

If `row[2]` is not `'#'`:
- If `i` is even, `r` has an additional `'#'` appended to its existing elements and `b` is `['#', '.']`.
- If `i` is odd, `r` has one more `'.'` than before and `b` is `['.', '#']`.***
