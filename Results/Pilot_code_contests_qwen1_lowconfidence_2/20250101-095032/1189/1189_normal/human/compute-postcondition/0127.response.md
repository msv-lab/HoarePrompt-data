The code `print(r)` prints the list `r`. This does not change any of the values of the variables. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n`, `m` is the original value of `m`, `row` is a list of strings input by the user corresponding to each row of the grid, `r` is a non-empty list, `b` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first and last elements are `'#'` and the rest alternate between `'#'` and `'.'`, `red` is a list of strings where each string is the joined version of the corresponding `r` list, `blue` is a list of strings where each string is the joined version of the corresponding `b` list; `r` is printed, and `red` must have at least one more element.**
