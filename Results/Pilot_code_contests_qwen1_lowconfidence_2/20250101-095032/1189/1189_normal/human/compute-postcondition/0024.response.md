The code `b.append('.')` appends the character `'.'` to the list `b`. The initial state does not provide any information about the list `b`, so after this line of code is executed, `b` will contain the element `'#'` from its initial state and the new element `'.'`.

Output State: **`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1 (now `m-1` if it was `m-2` previously), `r` is a list containing the element `'#'`, `b` is a list containing `'#'` and `'.'`**
