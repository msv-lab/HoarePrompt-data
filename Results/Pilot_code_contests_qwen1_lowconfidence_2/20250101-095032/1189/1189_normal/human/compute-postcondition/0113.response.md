`b` is appended with the value `'.'`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same in terms of the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`; `row` is a string entered by the user; `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `r` contains at least one `'#'`; `b` is a list with an additional element `'.'` appended to it.**
