The code snippet appends `'#'` to the list `b`. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

1. `m` remains greater than 1.
2. `j` remains `m-1`.
3. `row[j]` remains either `'#'` or not `'#'`.
4. `r` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
5. `b` originally depends on `row[j]` and `i`:
   - If `row[j]` is `'#'` and `i` is not specified, even, or odd, `b` is `['#'] * (m-1)`.
   - If `row[j]` is `'#'` and `i` is specified, `b` is also `['#'] * (m-1)`.
   - If `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is even, `b` is `['#'] * (m-2) + ['.']`.
   - If `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is odd, `b` is `['#'] * (m-2) + ['#']`.

After appending `'#'` to `b`, the new state of `b` will be:
- If `row[j]` is `'#'` and `i` is not specified, even, or odd, `b` becomes `['#'] * (m-1) + ['#']`.
- If `row[j]` is `'#'` and `i` is specified, `b` becomes `['#'] * (m-1) + ['#']`.
- If `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is even, `b` becomes `['#'] * (m-2) + ['.'] + ['#']`.
- If `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is odd, `b` becomes `['#'] * (m-2) + ['#'] + ['#']`.

The other variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is `m-1`; `row[j]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`; `r` is `['#'] * (m-1) + ['.']` if `row[j]` is `'#'` and `i` is not specified, even, or odd; otherwise, `r` is `['#'] * (m-2) + ['#'] + ['.']` if `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is even, and `r` is `['#'] * (m-2) + ['.'] + ['#']` if `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is odd; `b` is `['#'] * (m-1) + ['#']` if `row[j]` is `'#'` and `i` is not specified, even, or odd; otherwise, `b` is `['#'] * (m-2) + ['#'] + ['#']` if `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is odd, and `b` is `['#'] * (m-2) + ['.'] + ['#']` if `row[j]` is not `'#'` and `i` is even.**
