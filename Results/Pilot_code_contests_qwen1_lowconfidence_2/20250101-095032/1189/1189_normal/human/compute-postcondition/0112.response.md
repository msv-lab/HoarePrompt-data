`r.append('#')` adds a `'#'` to the list `r`. The initial state does not specify the content of `r`, so after executing this line, `r` will contain at least one `'#'`. The other variables (`m`, `j`, `row`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`; `row` is a string entered by the user; `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `r` contains at least one `'#'`**
