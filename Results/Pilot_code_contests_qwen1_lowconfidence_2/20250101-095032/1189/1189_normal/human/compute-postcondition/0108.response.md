Postcondition: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2. If `row[j] == '#'`, then `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'` and `b` is a list containing `'#'`. Otherwise, if `i % 2 == 0`, then `r` is a list with one additional element `'#'` and `b` is appended with `'.'`. Otherwise, `r` is a list with an additional element `'. '` and `b` is `['#']`.**
