The code appends `'#'` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not include the definition of `b`. Since `b` is not defined initially, it is assumed to be an empty list before this line of code is executed. After appending `'#'` to the list, `b` will contain `['#']`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`; `row` is a string entered by the user; `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `r` is a list with an additional element `'.`'; `b` is `['#']`**
