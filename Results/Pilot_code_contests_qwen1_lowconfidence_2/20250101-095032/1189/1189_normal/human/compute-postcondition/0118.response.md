Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the original value of `m` (since `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration and the loop runs `m-2` times), `r` is a list with `m-1` elements where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions inside the loop, and `b` is a list with `m-1` elements where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions inside the loop.**
