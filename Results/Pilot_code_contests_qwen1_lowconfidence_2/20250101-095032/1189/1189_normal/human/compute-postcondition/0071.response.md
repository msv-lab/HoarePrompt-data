`b` is appended with `'#'`. The initial value of `b` is `['#']` if `row[2]` is `'#'` and `i` is not specified, otherwise `b` is modified based on the parity of `i`. After appending `'#'`, `b` becomes `['#', '#']` in both cases.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is 3; `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`; `r` is `['#', '#']` if `row[2]` is `'#'` and `i` is not specified, otherwise `r` is modified based on the parity of `i`; `b` is `['#', '#']` if `row[2]` is `'#'` and `i` is not specified, otherwise `b` is modified based on the parity of `i`.**
