`b.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `b`. Based on the initial state, the value of `b` depends on the condition of `row[2]` and the value of `i`. 

- If `row[2]` is `'#'`, then `b` is `['#']`.
- If `row[2]` is not `'#'`, then `b` has one more `'.'` than before based on the previous value of `i`.

In both cases, appending `'#'` to `b` results in:
- If `row[2]` is `'#'`, then `b` becomes `['#', '#']`.
- If `row[2]` is not `'#'`, then `b` becomes `['.', '#']` (one more `'.'` than before).

The states of the other variables (`m`, `j`, `row[2]`, `r`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 3, `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`, `r` is `['#', '.']` if `row[2]` is `'#'` and `i` can be anything, or `r` has one more `'.'` than before based on the previous value of `i`, and `b` is `['#', '#']` if `row[2]` is `'#'`, and `b` is `['.', '#']` if `row[2]` is not `'#'`**
