Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n`, `m` is the original value of `m`, `row` is a list of strings input by the user corresponding to each row of the grid, `r` is a list of length `m` where the first element is `'#'`, the last element is `'. '` and the rest of the elements alternate between `'#'` and `'.'` based on the value of `row[j]` and the parity of `j`, `b` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first and last elements are `'#'` and the rest alternate between `'#'` and `'.'`, `red` is a list of strings where each string is the joined version of the corresponding `r` list, `blue` is a list of strings where each string is the joined version of the corresponding `b` list.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, `row` is read as input.
- `r` and `b` are initialized with specific values and then modified based on the value of `row[j]` and the parity of `i`.
- `r` starts with `'#'` and ends with `'. '` with elements in between alternating based on the conditions provided.
- `b` starts with `'#'` and ends with `'#'` with elements in between alternating.
- After each iteration, `r` and `b` are converted to strings and appended to `red` and `blue` respectively.
- Since the loop runs exactly `n` times, all rows and their corresponding `r` and `b` lists will be processed and stored in `red` and `blue`.
