`b` is appended with `'#'`. The values of `m`, `j`, `row`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, `r` is a list with an additional element `#`; `b` is a list now containing at least one `'#'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, `r` is a list with an additional element `#`; `b` is a list containing `'#'`**
