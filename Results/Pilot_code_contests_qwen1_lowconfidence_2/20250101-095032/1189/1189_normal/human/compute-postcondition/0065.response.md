`r.append('.')` adds a period (`'.'`) to the list `r`. The other variables (`m`, `j`, `row[2]`, `i`, `r`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation. The initial state of `m` being greater than 1 and `j` being 2 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`, `r` is a list containing one additional element `'.'`, and `b` is adjusted based on the value of `row[2]` and the parity of `i`.**
