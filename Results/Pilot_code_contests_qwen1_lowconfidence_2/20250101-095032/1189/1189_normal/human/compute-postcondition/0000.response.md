The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and splits them using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means `n` and `m` will hold the values of these two integers, which are the dimensions of the grid (H and W). However, the actual values of `n` and `m` are not specified in the initial state, so they will be represented as `n` and `m` in the output state.

The initial state also mentions that `a_{ij}` is either `#` or `.` with certain conditions, but the code provided does not affect these values. Therefore, those conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 500); at least one of `a_{ij}` is `#`; `a_{ij}` is `.` if i=1, n or j=1, m.**
