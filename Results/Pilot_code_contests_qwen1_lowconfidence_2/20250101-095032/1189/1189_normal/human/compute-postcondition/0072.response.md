The code snippet `r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Based on the initial conditions:

- `m` is greater than 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`.

Let's consider both cases for `row[2]`:

1. If `row[2]` is `'#'`:
   - `r` is `['#']`.
   - `b` is `['#']`.

After running the code `r.append('#')`, the list `r` becomes `['#', '#']`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, which is `['#']`.

2. If `row[2]` is not `'#'`:
   - If `i` is even, `r` contains `'#'` added to its existing elements, and `b` contains an additional `'.'` appended to it.
   - If `i` is odd, `r` is a list containing one additional element `'.'`, and `b` is a list that includes its previous elements plus `'#'`.

After running the code `r.append('#')`, the list `r` becomes the list with an additional `'#'` appended to its existing elements. The value of `b` becomes the list with an additional `'.'` appended to it.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`.
- `r` is updated accordingly to the case it falls under.
- `b` is updated accordingly to the case it falls under.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 3, `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`, `r` is `['#', '#']` if `row[2]` is `'#'` and `r` is the list with an additional `'#'` appended to its existing elements if `row[2]` is not `'#'`, `b` is `['#']` if `row[2]` is `'#'` and `b` is the list with an additional `'.'` appended to it if `row[2]` is not `'#'`**.
