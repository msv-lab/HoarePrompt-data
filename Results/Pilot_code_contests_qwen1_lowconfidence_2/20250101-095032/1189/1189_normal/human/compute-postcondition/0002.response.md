The code `blue = []` creates an empty list named `blue`. The initial state of `n` and `m` as integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and `red` as an empty list remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `blue` list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 500); at least one of `a_{ij}` is `#`; `a_{ij}` is `.` if i=1, n or j=1, m.; `red` is an empty list; `blue` is an empty list.**
