Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 3, `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`. If `row[2]` is `'#'` and `i` is even, `r` is `['#', '#']` and `b` is `['#', '.']`. If `row[2]` is `'#'` and `i` is odd, `r` is `['#', '.']` and `b` is `['#', '#']`. If `row[2]` is not `'#'` and `i` is even, `r` is a list with an additional `'#'` appended to its existing elements and `b` is `['#', '.']`. If `row[2]` is not `'#'` and `i` is odd, `r` has one more `'.'` than before and `b` is `['.', '#']`***
