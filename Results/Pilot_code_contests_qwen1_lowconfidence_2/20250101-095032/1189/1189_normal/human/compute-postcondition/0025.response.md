`r` is appended with the value `'.'`. The value of `row` is input from the user, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is `m-1` if it was `m-2` previously. The value of `j` itself does not change as it is not used in the code snippet.

Output State: **`row` is the input value provided by the user, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m-1`, `r` contains an additional element `'.'`**
