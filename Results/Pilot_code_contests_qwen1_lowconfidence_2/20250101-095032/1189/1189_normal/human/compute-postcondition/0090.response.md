The code appends `'#'` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` is `['.']`. After appending `'#'`, `b` becomes `['.', '#']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `r` is `['#', '#']`, `b` is `['.', '#']`, and the current value of `row[j]` is `#`.**
