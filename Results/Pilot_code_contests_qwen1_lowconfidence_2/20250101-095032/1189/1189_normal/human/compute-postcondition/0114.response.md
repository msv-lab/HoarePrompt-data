`r.append('.')` adds a period ('.') to the list `r`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is to the list `r`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, `r` is a list with an additional element '.'**
