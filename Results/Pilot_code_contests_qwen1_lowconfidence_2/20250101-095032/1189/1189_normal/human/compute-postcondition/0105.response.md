`r.append('.')` appends a period ('.') to the list `r`. The value of `m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, and `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2. The states of these variables remain unchanged except that a period is added to the list `r`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, `r` is a list with an additional element '.'**
