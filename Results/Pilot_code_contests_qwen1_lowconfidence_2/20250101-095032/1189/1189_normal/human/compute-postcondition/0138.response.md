The function `func` accepts two parameters `H` and `W`. Both `H` and `W` are integers such that \(3 \leq H, W \leq 500\), and \(a_{ij}\) is either `#` or `.`. Additionally, \(a_{ij}\) is `.` if \(i = 1\) or \(H\) or \(j = 1\) or \(W\), and at least one of \(a_{ij}\) is `#`.

Output:
Case_1: The function returns `True` if there is at least one `#` inside the grid (excluding the borders).
Case_2: The function returns `False` if there are no `#` inside the grid (excluding the borders).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `H` and `W`, and return `True` if there is at least one `#` inside the grid (excluding the borders). If there are no `#` inside the grid (excluding the borders), it returns `False`.
