The given Python code initializes an empty list named `red`. The initial state of the variables `n` and `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only affected variable is `red`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 500); at least one of `a_{ij}` is `#`; `a_{ij}` is `.` if i=1, n or j=1, m.; `red` is an empty list.**
