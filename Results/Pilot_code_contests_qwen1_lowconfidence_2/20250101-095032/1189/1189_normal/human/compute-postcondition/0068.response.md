Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `row[2]` is either `'#'` or not `'#'`. If `row[2]` is `'#'` (regardless of `i` being even or odd), `r` is `['#']` and `b` is `['#']`. If `row[2]` is not `'#'`, `r` and `b` are adjusted as follows: if `i` is even, `r` contains `'#'` added to its existing elements, and `b` contains an additional `'.'` appended to it. If `i` is odd, `r` is a list containing one additional element `'.'`, and `b` is a list that includes its previous elements plus `'#'`***.
