The code `b.append('#')` appends the character `'#'` to the list `b`. The initial state does not specify the value of `b`, so after appending `'#'`, `b` will contain `'#'`. The other variables (`m`, `j`, `row`, `i`, and `r`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'`, `b` is a list containing `'#'`**
