`r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. The values of `m`, `j`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, and `r` is a list with one additional element `'#'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is within the range `1` to `m - 3`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, and `r` is a list with one additional element `'#'`**.
