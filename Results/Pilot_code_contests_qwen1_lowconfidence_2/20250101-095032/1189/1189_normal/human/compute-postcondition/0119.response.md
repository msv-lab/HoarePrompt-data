The code snippet `r.append('.')` appends a `'.'` to the list `r`. Since `r` originally contains `m-1` elements, this operation increases its length by 1, making it now contain `m` elements, with the last element being `'.'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is `m - 2`, `row` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the original value of `m`, `r` is a list with `m` elements where the last element is `'.'` and the rest are either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions inside the loop, and `b` is a list with `m-1` elements where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions inside the loop.**
