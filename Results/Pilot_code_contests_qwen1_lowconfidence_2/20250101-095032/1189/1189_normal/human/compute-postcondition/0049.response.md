`r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. The value of `m` being greater than 1 and `row[j]` being `'#'` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1; `row[j]` equals `'#'`; `r` contains the element `'#'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `row[j]` equals `'#'`; `r` contains the element `'#'`**
