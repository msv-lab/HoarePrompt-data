The function `func` accepts two parameters `H` and `W`, which represent the height and width of a grid, respectively. It processes a grid represented by `H` rows and `W` columns, where each cell can be either `#` or `.`. The function constructs two modified grids: one with alternating `#` and `.` starting from `#` (referred to as `red`), and another with alternating `#` and `.` starting from `#` but excluding the last column (referred to as `blue`). After processing, it prints both modified grids. The function does not return anything but modifies and prints the grid according to the specified patterns.
