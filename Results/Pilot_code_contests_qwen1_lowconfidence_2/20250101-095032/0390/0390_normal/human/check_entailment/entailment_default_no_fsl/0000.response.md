Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the relative order of platforms remains unchanged and that the platforms do not intersect each other after moving them. Here is an example where the code fails:

### Example Input:
```
7 3 2
1 2 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 0 3
```

### Actual Output:
```
NO
```

### Reason:
The code tries to adjust the positions of platforms to fit within the jump distance `d`, but it does not properly maintain the non-intersecting condition and the relative order of platforms. In this specific case, the platforms are initially placed at positions `[7, 5, 3]` (0-based indexing), and the code tries to move them to fit within the jump distance `d=2`. However, the code incorrectly moves the platforms, leading to an invalid configuration where the platforms overlap or do not allow reaching the target.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that:
1. Platforms do not overlap.
2. The relative order of platforms is maintained.
3. The adjusted positions still allow reaching the target position `n+1`.

The current implementation fails to handle these conditions correctly, resulting in an incorrect output for certain inputs.
