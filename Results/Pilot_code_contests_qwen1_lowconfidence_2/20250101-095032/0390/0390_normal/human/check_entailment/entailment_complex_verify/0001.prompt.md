You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a river of width n. The left bank of the river is cell 0 and the right bank is cell n + 1 (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of n + 2 cells numbered from 0 to n + 1). There are also m wooden platforms on a river, the i-th platform has length c_i (so the i-th platform takes c_i consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed n.

You are standing at 0 and want to reach n+1 somehow. If you are standing at the position x, you can jump to any position in the range [x + 1; x + d]. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if d=1, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells 0 and n+1 belong to wooden platforms.

You want to know if it is possible to reach n+1 from 0 if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.

Note that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).

For example, if n=7, m=3, d=2 and c = [1, 2, 1], then one of the ways to reach 8 from 0 is follow:

<image> The first example: n=7.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and d (1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, m ≤ n) — the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains m integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m (1 ≤ c_i ≤ n, ∑_{i=1}^{m} c_i ≤ n), where c_i is the length of the i-th platform.

Output

If it is impossible to reach n+1 from 0, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array a of length n in the second line — the sequence of river cells (excluding cell 0 and cell n + 1).

If the cell i does not belong to any platform, a_i should be 0. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform (1-indexed, platforms are numbered from 1 to m in order of input) to which the cell i belongs.

Note that all a_i equal to 1 should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_1, all a_i equal to 2 should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_2, ..., all a_i equal to m should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_m. The leftmost position of 2 in a should be greater than the rightmost position of 1, the leftmost position of 3 in a should be greater than the rightmost position of 2, ..., the leftmost position of m in a should be greater than the rightmost position of m-1.

See example outputs for better understanding.

0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 

Note

Consider the first example: the answer is [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]. The sequence of jumps you perform is 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8.

Consider the second example: it does not matter how to place the platform because you always can jump from 0 to 11.

Consider the third example: the answer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The sequence of jumps you perform is 0 → 5 → 6 → 11.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, m, d) = rints()
    (c, ans) = (rints(), [0] * n)
    (pos, su) = ([], 0)
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
        su += c[i]
    pos.append(0)
    pos.reverse()
    for i in range(m):
        if pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d:
            for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
                ans[j - 1] = i + 1
            continue
        pos[i + 1] = min(pos[i] + d, n)
        for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
            ans[j - 1] = i + 1
        pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1
    if n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the last platform's end is too far from the target (n+1) after moving platforms. Specifically, the program checks if `n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d` to determine if it is possible to reach the target, but this check might not be sufficient. Consider the following example:

Input:
```
10 1 5
2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
```

However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program checks the distance from the last platform's end to the target after potentially moving the platforms, but it does not ensure that the platforms are optimally placed to cover the entire distance. In this case, the last platform can be moved to cover the remaining distance, making it possible to reach the target. The program should ensure that after moving the platforms, there is no gap larger than `d` between the end of the last platform and the target.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

        if pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d:

If \(n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d\), the console prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is the space-separated string representation of `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `c` of positive integers under given constraints defined by `n`, `m`, and `d`. It determines whether it is possible to assign values to a list `ans` of length `n` such that the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` does not exceed `d`. If possible, it assigns values to `ans` based on the elements of `c` and prints 'YES' followed by the list `ans` in a space-separated format. If it is not possible to satisfy the condition, it prints 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
