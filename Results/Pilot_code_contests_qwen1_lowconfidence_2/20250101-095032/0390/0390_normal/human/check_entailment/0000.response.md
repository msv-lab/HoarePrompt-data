Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the platforms are placed in such a way that allows reaching cell \( n+1 \) from cell \( 0 \) with jumps of size \( d \). Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
n = 7, m = 2, d = 2
c = [3, 2]
```

According to the problem, we need to place the platforms in a way that allows us to jump from \( 0 \) to \( n+1 \). However, the program places the platforms as follows:
- The first platform of length 3 is placed starting at position 4 (since the second last position is 7-2=5, and placing it at 4 gives a valid segment).
- The second platform of length 2 is placed starting at position 6.

This results in the array:
```
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

With this arrangement, we can see that we can only jump from 0 to 2, and then from 2 to 4, but we cannot jump from 4 to 6 because the gap between 4 and 6 is 2, and we can only jump up to 2 units forward. Therefore, we cannot reach \( n+1 \).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the placement of platforms allows for continuous jumps of size \( d \) from \( 0 \) to \( n+1 \). This can be achieved by ensuring that the end of one platform is at most \( d \) units away from the start of the next platform. The current implementation does not enforce this constraint.
