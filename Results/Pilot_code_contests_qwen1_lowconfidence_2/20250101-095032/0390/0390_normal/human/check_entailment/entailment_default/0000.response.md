Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the placement of platforms to ensure that it is possible to jump from cell 0 to cell n+1. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Platform Placement Logic**: The code attempts to place platforms in reverse order, which can lead to incorrect placements. The primary issue is that the code does not ensure that the placement of platforms allows for valid jumps within the given constraints.

2. **Jump Distance Constraint**: The code does not correctly adjust the positions of platforms to ensure that the jump distance constraint (`d`) is met. The logic for adjusting positions when the distance constraint is not satisfied is flawed.

3. **Final Check for Reachability**: The final check to determine if the last platform can be placed such that it is reachable from cell 0 is insufficient. The code does not guarantee that the platforms are placed in a way that allows for a valid sequence of jumps.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```plaintext
Input:
n = 7, m = 3, d = 2
c = [1, 2, 1]
```

Expected output:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 0 3
```

However, running the provided code with this input results in an incorrect placement of platforms, which does not allow for a valid sequence of jumps.

Therefore, the code fails to meet the problem requirements for certain cases, leading to incorrect outputs. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
