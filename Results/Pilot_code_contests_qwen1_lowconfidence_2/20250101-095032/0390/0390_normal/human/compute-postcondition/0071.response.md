Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is an integer where `i` is `m + 1`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\), `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `j - 1` is now `i + 1`, `pos` is a list where `pos[i + 1]` is updated correctly and `pos[i + 1] == n`, `ans[j - 1]` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i] + 1`.**
