Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is an integer, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`, the elements in the range \([pos[i + 1] - 1, pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2]\) are set to `i + 1`, and all other elements are 0, `pos` is a list where `pos[i + 1]` is the position where the next value in the `ans` list will start, reflecting the cumulative sum of `c[i] - 1` for each `i` and adjusted by the rule `pos[i + 1] = min(pos[i] + d, n)` when necessary, and `pos[m + 1] == n`. The condition `(n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) <= d)` holds true.**
