The code `su += c[i]` adds the value of `c[i]` to `su`. The previous value of `su` was `c[0] + c[m - 2]`. After adding `c[i]` to `su`, the new value of `su` becomes `c[0] + c[m - 2] + c[i]`.

All other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000; `m` is a positive integer at least 1; `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000; `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `pos` is a list containing three elements: `n + 1 - c[0]`, `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2]`, and `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2] - c[i]`; `su` is `c[0] + c[m - 2] + c[i]`.**
