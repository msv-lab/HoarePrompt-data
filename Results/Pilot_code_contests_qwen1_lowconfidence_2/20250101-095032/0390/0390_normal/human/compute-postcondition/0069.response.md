The code snippet updates the value of `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1`. To determine the specific values, let's break down the given information:

- `ans[j - 1]` was initially set to `m + 2`.
- `j` is defined as `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Given that `ans[j - 1]` was previously set to `m + 2`, updating it to `i + 1` means `ans[j - 1]` now holds the value `i + 1`.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the only change is in `ans[j - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is an integer where `i` is `m + 1`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\), `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `j - 1` is now `i + 1`, `pos` is a list where `pos[i + 1]` is updated correctly and `pos[m + 1] == n`, `pos[i + 1]` must be defined and a valid index, and `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must be a valid index, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.**
