The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. Based on the initial state, `ans[j - 1]` was already `i + 1`. Now, it remains unchanged because the same value is being reassigned. The values of `j` and the condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 2`, and `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`**
