Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is an integer where `i` is `m`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`, the elements in the range `[pos[i + 1] - 1, pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2]` are set to `i + 1`, and all other elements are 0, `pos` is a list where `pos[i + 1]` reflects the cumulative sum of `c[i] - 1` for each `i`. If `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, `pos[i + 1]` is updated to its current value plus `c[i] - 1` and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `pos` and `i` remains the same.***
