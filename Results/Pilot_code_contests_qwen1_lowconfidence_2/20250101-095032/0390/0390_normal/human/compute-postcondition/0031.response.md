The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. According to the initial state, `ans[j - 1]` is currently `i + 1`. After running this line of code, the value of `ans[j - 1]` will be updated to `i + 1` again, which means the value remains unchanged. The values of `j` and the condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`**
