According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the conditions involving `pos[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust `j` to reflect this change. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Let's break it down step by step:
1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.
2. For the loop to continue, `j` must still satisfy the condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be `j + 2` (since `j` was already `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
- The condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must hold true.

So, the updated states are:
- `ans[j - 1]` remains `i + 1`
- `j` becomes `j + 2`
- `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must still hold true.

State: **`ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 2`, and `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`**
