Let's analyze the given code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `total` is 0
  - `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000
  - `m` must be at least 1
  - `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000
  - `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`
  - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros
  - `pos` is a list containing one new element `n + 1 - c[0]`
  - `su` is `c[0]`

- Code: 
  ```python
  pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
  ```

- Analysis:
  - The code appends a new element to the `pos` list.
  - The new element is calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.
  - Here, `su` is defined as `c[0]`, so the new element is `n + 1 - c[0] - c[i]`.

Since `i` is not defined in the provided context and there is no loop or index specification, we can infer that `i` is likely an index within the range of the list `c`. However, without a specific value for `i`, the exact value of the appended element cannot be determined precisely. 

Given this, the output state will include the updated `pos` list, which now includes two elements: `n + 1 - c[0]` (the original value) and `n + 1 - c[0] - c[i]`.

- Updated Variables:
  - `total` remains unchanged
  - `n` remains unchanged
  - `m` remains unchanged
  - `d` remains unchanged
  - `c` remains unchanged
  - `ans` remains unchanged
  - `pos` is updated to include `n + 1 - c[0]` and `n + 1 - c[0] - c[i]`
  - `su` remains unchanged

- Output State:
  **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` must be at least 1, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `pos` is a list containing two elements: `n + 1 - c[0]` and `n + 1 - c[0] - c[i]`, `su` is `c[0]`**
