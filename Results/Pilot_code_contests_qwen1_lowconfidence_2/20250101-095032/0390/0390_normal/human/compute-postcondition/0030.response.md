To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the range of the for loop and how the variables `j` and `pos[i + 1]` interact.

Given:
- The loop starts from `j = pos[i + 1]`.
- The loop runs until `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.
- This means that `j - 1` was the last index modified, so `j` was the current value at the end of the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be incremented and still satisfy the condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the current value of `j`**:
   - Since `ans[j - 1]` was updated to `i + 1`, `j` must have been the value at the end of the previous iteration.
   
2. **Increment `j`**:
   - To enter the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - So, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

3. **Check the condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans[j - 1]` was updated to `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `ans[j]` (where `j` is the new value) will be updated.
   - Thus, `ans[j]` will be `i + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` (unchanged).
- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- The condition for the next iteration is that `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Final state:
State: **`ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`**.
