Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
   - `m` is at least 1.
   - `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
   - `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized as specified.
   - `pos` is a list of integers where `pos[i + 1]` is updated to its current value plus `c[i] - 1` after the loop.
   - `i` is an index variable that starts at 0 and increments by 1 after each iteration until it reaches `m`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs while `i` is less than `m`.

4. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted but is assumed to update `ans` based on the range defined by `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

5. **Determining the Initial States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `i < m` at the start of the loop.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the initial state must include `i` being 0 and `i` being less than `m`.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` must be 0 (since it starts at 0).
- `i` must be less than `m`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is at least 1, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`, the elements in the range `[pos[i + 1] - 1, pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2]` are set to `i + 1`, and all other elements are `0`, and `pos[i + 1]` is updated to its current value plus `c[i] - 1`, `i` is 0, and `i` is less than `m`**.
