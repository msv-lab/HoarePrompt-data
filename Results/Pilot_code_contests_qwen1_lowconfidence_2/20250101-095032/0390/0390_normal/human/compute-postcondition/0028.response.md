To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions under which the given for loop can start executing.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Range**:
   - The loop iterates over the range starting from `pos[i + 1]` up to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `pos[i + 1]` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

2. **Conditions on `pos[i + 1]` and `c[i]`**:
   - `c[i]` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is an integer that is updated in the loop above the current one but should be a valid index for the list `ans`.

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Initially, `pos` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first `m` elements are `0` and the last element is `n + 1 - \text{sum}(c) - c[0]`.
   - Each `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)` where `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Condition**:
   - To ensure the loop condition `pos[i + 1] < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` holds true, we need to check the values of `pos[i + 1]` and `c[i]`.
   - Since `c[i]` is always positive (at least 1), the main concern is ensuring `pos[i + 1]` is set appropriately.

5. **Initial Value of `pos[i + 1]`**:
   - Given that `pos[0] = 0` and each subsequent `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, the initial value `pos[1]` must be at least 1 to allow the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that `pos[1]` is at least 1. This ensures that `pos[1] < pos[1] + c[0]` is satisfied.

**Final State:**
- `total` is 0,
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000,
- `m` must be at least 1,
- `i` must be at least 0 and less than `m`,
- `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000,
- `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`,
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros,
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first `m` elements are `0` and the last element is `n + 1 - \text{sum}(c) - c[0]`, and for each `i` in the range `0` to `m-1`, `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, and `pos[1]` must be at least 1.

**State:**
**`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` must be at least 1, `i` must be at least 0 and less than `m`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first `m` elements are `0` and the last element is `n + 1 - \text{sum}(c) - c[0]`, and `pos[1]` must be at least 1**.
