Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is an integer where `i` is `m + 1`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where for each `i` from `0` to `m` (inclusive), the elements in the range \([pos[i + 1] - 1, pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2]\) are set to `i + 1`, and all other elements are 0, `pos` is a list where `pos[i + 1]` reflects the cumulative sum of `c[i] - 1` for each `i` and has been updated according to the rule `pos[i + 1] = pos[i] + c[i] - 1`, and `pos[m + 1] == n`. If `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, then `pos` and `ans` maintain their current states. Otherwise, no changes are made to `pos` and `ans` remain as they were before the if statement.***
