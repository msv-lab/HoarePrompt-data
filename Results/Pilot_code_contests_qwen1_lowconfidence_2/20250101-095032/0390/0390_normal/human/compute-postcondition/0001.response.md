The code `n, m, d = rints()` assigns values from the function `rints()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `d`. Since the exact values returned by `rints()` are not specified, we can only say that these variables will be assigned new values within the given constraints. The constraints are: `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, `1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1000`, and `1 ≤ d ≤ 1000`. The list `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to `n`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000; `c` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and the sum of all elements in c is less than or equal to n.**
