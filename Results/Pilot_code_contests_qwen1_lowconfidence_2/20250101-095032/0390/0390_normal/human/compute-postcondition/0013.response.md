To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to `n`.
- `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `pos` is an empty list.
- `su` is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
    su += c[i]
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop starts from `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` until `i = -1`. This means the loop will execute `m` times.
2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `pos` will append a new element each time the loop runs.
   - `su` will accumulate the sum of the elements in `c` from `i = m - 1` to `i = 0`.

### Final Values
- After the loop completes, `su` will be the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `pos` will contain `m` elements, where each element is calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` ranging from `m - 1` to `0`.

### Output State
- `total` is 0 (unchanged).
- `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `m` must be at least 1 (unchanged).
- `d` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000 (unchanged).
- `c` remains a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n` (unchanged).
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros (unchanged).
- `pos` is a list containing `m` elements, where each element is `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` ranging from `m - 1` to `0`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is a positive integer at least 1, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `pos` is a list containing `m` elements, where each element is `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` ranging from `m - 1` to `0`, `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.**
