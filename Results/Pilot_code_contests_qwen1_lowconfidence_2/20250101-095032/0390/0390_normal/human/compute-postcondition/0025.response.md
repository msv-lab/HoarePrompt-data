The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` must be at least 1 and `i` must be at least 0 and less than `m`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros where each index `j - 1` (where `j` ranges from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`) is set to `i + 1`, `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first `m` elements are `0` and the last element is `n + 1 - \text{sum}(c) - c[0]`, the difference between `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, and `c[i]` is greater than 0 for all valid `i` and `pos[i + 1]` is defined for all valid `i`.**
