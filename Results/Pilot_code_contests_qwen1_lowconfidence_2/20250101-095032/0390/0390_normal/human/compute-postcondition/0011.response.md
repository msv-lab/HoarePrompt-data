Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000
   - `m` is a positive integer at least 1
   - `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000
   - `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros
   - `pos` is a list containing two elements: `n + 1 - c[0]` and `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2]`
   - `su` is `c[0] + c[m - 2]`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
   ```

   Here, `pos` is a list initially containing two elements: `n + 1 - c[0]` and `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2]`. We need to append another element to this list. The new element is `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.

3. Substituting the known values:
   - `su` is `c[0] + c[m - 2]`
   - Therefore, `n + 1 - su - c[i]` becomes `n + 1 - (c[0] + c[m - 2]) - c[i]`

4. The updated `pos` list will be:
   - First element: `n + 1 - c[0]`
   - Second element: `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2]`
   - Third element: `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2] - c[i]`

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000; `m` is a positive integer at least 1; `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000; `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `pos` is a list containing three elements: `n + 1 - c[0]`, `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2]`, and `n + 1 - c[0] - c[m - 2] - c[i]`; `su` is `c[0] + c[m - 2]`.**
