The provided lambda function `rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]` does not actually modify any variables; it only defines a new function `rints`. This function reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string to an integer, returning a list of these integers. Since no variables are directly assigned or modified within this lambda function, the initial states of `n`, `m`, `d`, and the list `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1000; `d` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000; the list `c` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and the sum of all elements in c is less than or equal to n.**
