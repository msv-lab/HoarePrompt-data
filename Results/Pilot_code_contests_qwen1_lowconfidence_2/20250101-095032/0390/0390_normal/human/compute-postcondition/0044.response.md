The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, the variables are not modified by this statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is an integer where `i` is `m`, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`, the elements in the range `[pos[i + 1] - 1, pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2]` are set to `i + 1`, and all other elements are 0, `pos` is a list where `pos[i + 1]` reflects the cumulative sum of `c[i] - 1` for each `i`.**
