The code appends the value `0` to the list `pos`. The previous value of `pos` is a list containing `m` elements, where each element is `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` ranging from `m - 1` to `0`. After appending `0`, the length of `pos` increases by 1, making it `m + 1` elements long.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is a positive integer at least 1, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` ranging from `m - 1` to `0` and the last element is `0`, `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.**
