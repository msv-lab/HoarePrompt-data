The code `pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])` appends the value `n + 1 - su - c[i]` to the list `pos`. However, the index `i` is not defined in the given code snippet, which means there's no iteration over the list `c`. This suggests that `i` might be a variable that holds an index of the list `c`, but its value is not specified.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, let's assume `i` is an index within the range of `c`. Given that `c` is a list of positive integers such that each element is between 1 and `n` and the sum of all elements is less than or equal to `n`, we know that `c[i]` is a positive integer within this range.

Therefore, the value `n + 1 - su - c[i]` will be appended to `pos`, but without knowing the exact value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of the element appended to `pos`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` must be at least 1, `d` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is a list of positive integers such that \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `pos` is a list containing one new element `n + 1 - su - c[i]`, `su` is 0**
