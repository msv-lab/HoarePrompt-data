Functionality: **The function processes a list `c` of positive integers under given constraints defined by `n`, `m`, and `d`. It determines whether it is possible to assign values to a list `ans` of length `n` such that the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` does not exceed `d`. If possible, it assigns values to `ans` based on the elements of `c` and prints 'YES' followed by the list `ans` in a space-separated format. If it is not possible to satisfy the condition, it prints 'NO'.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `d` from standard input.
2. Reads a list `c` of positive integers and initializes an empty list `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to zero.
3. Constructs a list `pos` where `pos[i]` indicates the starting position for assigning the value `i + 1` in the list `ans`.
4. Adjusts the positions in `pos` to ensure that the difference between consecutive elements does not exceed `d`.
5. Assigns values to `ans` based on the adjusted positions in `pos` and the elements in `c`.
6. Checks if the final position adjustment respects the constraint \(n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d\). If it does, prints 'NO'; otherwise, prints 'YES' followed by the list `ans` in a space-separated format.

**Potential edge cases:**
- If the sum of elements in `c` exceeds `n`, the function cannot proceed and should handle this case appropriately (though the current code does not explicitly check this).
- If `m` is 0 (no elements in `c`), the function should still work correctly by setting `ans` to `[0] * n`.

**Missing functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly check if the sum of elements in `c` exceeds `n`, which could lead to an error in subsequent operations. This check should be added to ensure the function's robustness.
