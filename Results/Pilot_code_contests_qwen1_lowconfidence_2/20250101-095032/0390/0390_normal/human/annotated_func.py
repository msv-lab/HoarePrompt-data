#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `c` of positive integers under given constraints defined by `n`, `m`, and `d`. It determines whether it is possible to assign values to a list `ans` of length `n` such that the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` does not exceed `d`. If possible, it assigns values to `ans` based on the elements of `c` and prints 'YES' followed by the list `ans` in a space-separated format. If it is not possible to satisfy the condition, it prints 'NO'.
