The function `func_2` accepts a variable number of string arguments (`args`) and an optional keyword argument `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). It writes these strings to the specified file, separated by a space (`sep`), and adds a newline character (`end`) at the end. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer of `sys.stdout`. The final state of the program after the function executes is that all strings in `args` are concatenated with a space in between, written to `file`, and followed by a newline character unless explicitly overridden. If `flush` is `True`, the output buffer is flushed.
