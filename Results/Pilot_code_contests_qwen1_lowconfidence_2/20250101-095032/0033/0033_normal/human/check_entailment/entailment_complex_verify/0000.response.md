Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly counts the number of test cases for each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`) and prints the results in the required format. The annotations confirm that the program processes the input as specified and maintains the correct state throughout its execution. The function `func_2` ensures that the output is formatted correctly according to the problem requirements. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
