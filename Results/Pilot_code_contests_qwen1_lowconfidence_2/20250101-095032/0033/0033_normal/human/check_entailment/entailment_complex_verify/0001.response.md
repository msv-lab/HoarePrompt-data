Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly processes the input according to the problem statement, counting the occurrences of each verdict type (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`). The function `func_1` iterates through the list of verdicts and updates the counters for each verdict type. The function `func_2` is then called to print the results in the required format.

The annotated code provides clear insights into the state of the program at different points, confirming that the program behaves as expected:
1. The `func_1` function correctly counts the occurrences of each verdict type.
2. The `func_2` function correctly formats and prints the results.

There are no discrepancies between the problem description and the annotated code that would indicate the program is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
