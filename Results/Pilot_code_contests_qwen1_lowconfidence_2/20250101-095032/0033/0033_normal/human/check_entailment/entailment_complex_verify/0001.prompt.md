You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi is participating in a programming contest called AXC002, and he has just submitted his code to Problem A.

The problem has N test cases.

For each test case i (1\leq i \leq N), you are given a string S_i representing the verdict for that test case. Find the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively.

See the Output section for the output format.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* S_i is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S_1
\vdots
S_N


Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of verdicts and counts the occurrences of `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`. It then prints the results in the specified format. The program handles all the given constraints and examples correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to fail under different inputs or conditions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `S` of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), where each element in the list is one of the strings 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each string type and then calls the function `func_2` with specific messages and corresponding counts. After processing, the function updates four variables: `ac` (count of 'AC'), `wa` (count of 'WA'), `tle` (count of 'TLE'), and `re` (1 if 'RE' appears at least once, otherwise 0). The function does not return any value.

Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a variable number of string arguments (`args`) and an optional keyword argument `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). It writes these strings to the specified file, separated by a space (`sep`), and adds a newline character (`end`) at the end. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer of `sys.stdout`. The final state of the program after the function executes is that all strings in `args` are concatenated with a space in between, written to `file`, and followed by a newline character unless explicitly overridden. If `flush` is `True`, the output buffer is flushed.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
