You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi is participating in a programming contest called AXC002, and he has just submitted his code to Problem A.

The problem has N test cases.

For each test case i (1\leq i \leq N), you are given a string S_i representing the verdict for that test case. Find the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively.

See the Output section for the output format.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* S_i is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S_1
\vdots
S_N


Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Examples

Input

6
AC
TLE
AC
AC
WA
TLE


Output

AC x 3
WA x 1
TLE x 2
RE x 0


Input

10
AC
AC
AC
AC
AC
AC
AC

Output

AC x 10
WA x 0
TLE x 0
RE x 0
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    ac = 0
    wa = 0
    tle = 0
    re = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == 'AC':
            ac += 1
        elif i == 'WA':
            wa += 1
        elif i == 'TLE':
            tle += 1
        elif i == 'RE':
            re += 1
    func_2('AC x', ac)
    func_2('WA x', wa)
    func_2('TLE x', tle)
    func_2('RE x', re)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
