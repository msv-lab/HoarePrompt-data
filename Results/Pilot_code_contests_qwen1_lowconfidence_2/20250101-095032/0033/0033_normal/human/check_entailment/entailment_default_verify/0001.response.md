Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of verdicts and counts the occurrences of `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`. The function `func_2` is used to print these counts in the specified format. The output hints confirm that `func_2` works as expected, concatenating the provided strings with a space separator and appending a newline character. Since the program handles all given constraints and examples correctly and the function `func_2` is implemented to meet the required specifications, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
