Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly counts the number of test cases for each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`) and prints them in the required format. The `func_2` function handles the printing process as described in the output hints, ensuring that the strings are concatenated with a space in between and followed by a newline character. Since the program meets the problem description and handles all given constraints and examples properly, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
