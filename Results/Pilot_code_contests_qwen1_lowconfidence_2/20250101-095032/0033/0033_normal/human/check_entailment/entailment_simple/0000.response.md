Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing a verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`).

2. **Counting Verdicts:**
   - The program uses variables `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` to count the occurrences of each verdict.
   - It iterates through the list of verdicts and updates these counters accordingly.

3. **Printing Output:**
   - After counting the occurrences, the program prints the counts in the required format:
     ```
     AC x C_0
     WA x C_1
     TLE x C_2
     RE x C_3
     ```
   - The counters are passed to the `func_2` function, which prints them to `sys.stdout` with the appropriate separators and formatting.

4. **Handling Function Calls:**
   - The `func_2` function is used to print the formatted output, ensuring the correct separation and order of the output.

Given that the problem description specifies the exact input and output format, the provided program meets all the requirements. It correctly reads the input, processes the verdicts, and outputs the results in the specified format. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
