Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts and prints the number of test cases for each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`). It handles all given constraints and examples properly. Here's a brief analysis:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `N` and then iterates over `N` strings, counting the occurrences of each verdict.
2. It uses a dictionary-like approach with variables (`ac`, `wa`, `tle`, `re`) to keep track of the counts.
3. After processing all test cases, it calls `func_2` to print the results in the required format.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all possible inputs within the given constraints, it is correct. There are no potential cases identified where the program fails to meet the requirements.
