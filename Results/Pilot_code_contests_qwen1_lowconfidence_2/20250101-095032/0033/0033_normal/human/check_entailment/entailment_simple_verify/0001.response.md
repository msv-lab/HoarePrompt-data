Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The program correctly counts the occurrences of each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`) and prints them in the specified format. The annotations confirm that the program processes the input as expected and maintains the correct state throughout its execution. The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly updates the counters `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` based on the input list `s`. The function `func_2` is used appropriately to print the counts with the required format. There are no issues or edge cases that would cause the program to fail under the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
