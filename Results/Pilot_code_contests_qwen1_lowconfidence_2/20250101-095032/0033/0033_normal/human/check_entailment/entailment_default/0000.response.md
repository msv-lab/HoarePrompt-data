Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - Reads `n` lines of input, each containing a verdict ('AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE').
   - Counts the occurrences of each verdict using the variables `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re`.
   - Calls the function `func_2` to print the counts in the specified format.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Prints the counts in the format "AC x count", "WA x count", "TLE x count", and "RE x count" to the standard output.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the code handles all potential cases correctly:
- It correctly processes each line of input.
- It updates the count variables appropriately.
- It prints the results in the correct format.

There are no examples or hints indicating that the code fails for any valid input. Thus, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
