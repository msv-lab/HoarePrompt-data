Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case to count the occurrences of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', and 'RE', and then prints the counts in the required format. The `func_2` function is used to print the results, which matches the expected output format. There are no obvious edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail for any potential input within the given constraints.
