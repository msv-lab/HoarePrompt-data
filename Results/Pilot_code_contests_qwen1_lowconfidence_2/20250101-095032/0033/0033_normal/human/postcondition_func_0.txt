The function `func_1` processes a list `S` of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), where each element in the list is one of the strings 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each string type and then calls the function `func_2` with specific messages and corresponding counts. After processing, the function updates four variables: `ac` (count of 'AC'), `wa` (count of 'WA'), `tle` (count of 'TLE'), and `re` (1 if 'RE' appears at least once, otherwise 0). The function does not return any value.
