Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of at least 2 strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', and `s` must have at least two elements. If the string `i` is 'RE', `re` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` remain unchanged.***
