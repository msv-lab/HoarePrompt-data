Postcondition: ***`args` must contain at least three strings, `x` is the third string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`. Since the condition `not at_start` does not change these variable states, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
