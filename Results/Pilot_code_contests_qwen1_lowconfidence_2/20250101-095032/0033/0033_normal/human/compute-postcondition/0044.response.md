The function `func_2('RE x', re)` is called, which takes two arguments: 'RE x' and `re`. In the initial state, `re` is 1 if 'RE' appears at least once in `s`, otherwise it is 0. The function modifies `re` based on the first argument 'RE x'.

Since 'RE x' includes the substring 'RE', the function `func_2` will modify `re` to 1 regardless of its current value because 'RE' is present in the first argument.

Therefore, the value of `re` will be updated to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is the count of 'AC' in `s` plus 1, `wa` is modified by `func_2`, `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s` and is modified by `func_2`, and `re` is 1.**
