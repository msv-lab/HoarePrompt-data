The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the function definition `def func_1()`. The functionality of the function is to process a list `S` where the length of the list `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and each element `S_i` in the list is one of the strings 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. However, since no specific operation or return value is provided in the output cases, we can only state that the function processes this list.

Functionality: **The function processes a list `S` of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), and each element `S_i` in the list is one of the strings 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', but does not specify any particular return value.**
