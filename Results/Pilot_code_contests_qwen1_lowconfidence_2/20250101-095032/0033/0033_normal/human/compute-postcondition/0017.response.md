`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, this will print `x` to the standard output. The value of `x` is the third string in `args`, and the other variables (`args`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`) are not affected.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least three strings, `x` is the third string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `x` is printed to the standard output.**
