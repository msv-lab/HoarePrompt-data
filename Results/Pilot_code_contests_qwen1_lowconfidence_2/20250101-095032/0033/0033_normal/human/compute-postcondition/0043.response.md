The function `func_2` is called with two arguments: `'TLE x'` and `tle`. However, the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided. Assuming `func_2` modifies its second argument (which is `tle` in this case), let's proceed with the given information.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'
- `ac` is the count of 'AC' in `s` plus 1
- `wa` is modified by `func_2`
- `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s`
- `re` is 1 if 'RE' appears at least once in `s`, otherwise, it is 0

After calling `func_2('TLE x', tle)`, the value of `tle` will be modified by the function. Since the exact behavior of `func_2` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `tle`. We only know that `tle` will be updated according to the function's logic.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is unchanged, still within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is unchanged
- `ac` is unchanged
- `wa` is unchanged
- `tle` is modified by `func_2`
- `re` is unchanged

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is the count of 'AC' in `s` plus 1, `wa` is modified by `func_2`, `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s` and is modified by `func_2`, and `re` is 1 if 'RE' appears at least once in `s`, otherwise, it is 0.**
