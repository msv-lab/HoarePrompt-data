`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This does not change the values of `args`, `x`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least three strings, `x` is the third string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.**
