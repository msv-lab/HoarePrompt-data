Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', and `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` are updated as follows:
- `ac` is the count of 'AC' in `s`.
- `wa` is the count of 'WA' in `s`.
- `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s`.
- `re` is 1 if 'RE' appears at least once in `s`, otherwise, it is 0.**
