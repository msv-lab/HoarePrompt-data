`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of the file object. Since `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` was `True`, the output buffer is flushed, but this operation does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` is a variable number of strings, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, and the output buffer of `sys.stdout` has been flushed.**
