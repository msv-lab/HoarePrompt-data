The line `at_start = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least three strings, `x` is the third string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**
