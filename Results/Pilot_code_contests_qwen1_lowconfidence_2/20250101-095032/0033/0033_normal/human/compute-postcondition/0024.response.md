The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `args`, which is a variable number of strings representing the verdicts for each test case, and `file`, which is a file object (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) where the output will be written to. The function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a variable number of strings and a file object, and write the strings to the specified file.
