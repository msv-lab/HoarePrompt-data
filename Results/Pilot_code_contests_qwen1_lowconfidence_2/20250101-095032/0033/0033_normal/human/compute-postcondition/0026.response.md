`re` is incremented by 1. The value of `re` was previously set to 1 if any string in `s` was 'RE', so now `re` will be 2. The values of `n`, `s`, `ac`, `wa`, and `tle` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of at least 2 strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', and `s` must have at least two elements; if the string `i` is 'AC', `ac` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, there exists at least one string in `s` that is not 'AC'. If the string `i` is 'WA', `wa` is incremented by 1. If the string `i` is 'TLE', `tle` is incremented by 1. If the string `i` is 'RE', `re` is set to 1; `re` is 2.**
