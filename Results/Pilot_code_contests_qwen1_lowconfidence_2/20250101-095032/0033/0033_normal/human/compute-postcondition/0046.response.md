Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list `S` of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), where each element in the list is one of the strings 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each string type and then calls the function `func_2` with specific messages and corresponding counts. After processing, the function updates four variables: `ac` (count of 'AC'), `wa` (count of 'WA'), `tle` (count of 'TLE'), and `re` (1 if 'RE' appears at least once, otherwise 0). The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `s` contains no 'RE' strings, the variable `re` will be 0.
- If the list `s` contains exactly one 'RE' string, the variable `re` will be 1.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle any input validation for the values of `n` or the strings in `s`. It assumes that `n` is within the specified range and that each string in `s` is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'.

After the function concludes, the program will have updated counts of each type of string in the list `s` and will have called `func_2` with the appropriate arguments.
