The function `func_2('WA x', wa)` is called with two arguments: `'WA x'` and `wa`. The first argument `'WA x'` does not affect the variables directly, so we focus on the second argument `wa`.

The variable `wa` is updated within the function `func_2`, which means the value of `wa` changes after the function call. However, the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `wa` without that information. We only know that `wa` is modified inside `func_2`.

The other variables (`n`, `s`, `ac`, `tle`, and `re`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is the count of 'AC' in `s` plus 1, `wa` is modified by `func_2`, `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in `s`, and `re` is 1 if 'RE' appears at least once in `s`, otherwise, it is 0.**
