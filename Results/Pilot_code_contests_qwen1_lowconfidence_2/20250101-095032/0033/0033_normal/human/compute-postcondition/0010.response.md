`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must contain at least one string, `x` is the second string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `x` is the second string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
