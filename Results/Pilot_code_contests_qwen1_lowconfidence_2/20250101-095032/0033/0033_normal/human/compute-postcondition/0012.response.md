`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, the string representation of `x` is written to the standard output. The value of `args`, `sep`, and `at_start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `x` is the second string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and the standard output contains the string representation of `x`.**
