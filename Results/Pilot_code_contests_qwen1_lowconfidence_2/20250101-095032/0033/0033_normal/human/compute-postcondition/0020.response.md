The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `file` and `kwargs` variables. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` attempts to write the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`.
2. `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` removes the key `'end'` from `kwargs` and returns its value (which is `\n` by default if `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`).
3. The value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is written to `file`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a variable number of strings.
- `sep` is a space.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- All strings in `args` are concatenated with `sep` in between.
- `at_start` is `False`.

Since `kwargs` is not initially defined, `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` defaults to `\n`. This value is written to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` is a variable number of strings, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `sys.stdout.write('\n')` has been executed.**
