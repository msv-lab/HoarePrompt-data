`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `args`, `x`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this line of code. The standard output still contains the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `x` is the second string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.**
