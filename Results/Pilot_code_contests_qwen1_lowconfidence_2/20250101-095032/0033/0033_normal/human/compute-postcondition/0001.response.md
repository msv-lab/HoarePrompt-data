The code assigns the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` to `sep` and the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` to `file`. This means that `sep` is set to the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which defaults to a space if 'sep' is not present in `kwargs`. Similarly, `file` is set to the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which defaults to `sys.stdout` if 'file' is not present in `kwargs`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `kwargs`, we consider the default values. Therefore, the updated states are `sep` is a space and `file` is `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` is a variable number of strings representing the verdicts for each test case, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`**
