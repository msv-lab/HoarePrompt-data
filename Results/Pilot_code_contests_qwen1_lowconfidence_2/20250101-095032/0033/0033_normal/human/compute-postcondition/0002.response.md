The code initializes the variable `at_start` to `True`. The values of `args`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the only new information is the assignment of `True` to `at_start`.

Output State: **`args` is a variable number of strings representing the verdicts for each test case, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
