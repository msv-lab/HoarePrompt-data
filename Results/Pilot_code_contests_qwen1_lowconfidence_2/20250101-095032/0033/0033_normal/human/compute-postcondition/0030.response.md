Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of at least 2 strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', and `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` are updated as follows:
- If `i` is 'AC', `ac` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` is 'WA', `wa` is incremented by the number of 'WA' in `s`.
- If `i` is 'TLE', `tle` is incremented by the number of 'TLE' in `s` (if `i` was 'TLE' in the if part, `tle` is incremented by 1; if `i` was 'TLE' in the else part, `re` is set to 2).
- If `i` is 'RE', `re` is set to 2 (if `i` was 'RE' in the if part, `re` is set to 2; if `i` was 'RE' in the else part, `re` remains unchanged).
- Otherwise, the values of `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` remain unchanged.**
