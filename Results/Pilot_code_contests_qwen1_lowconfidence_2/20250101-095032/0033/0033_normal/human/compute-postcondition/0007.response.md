The code writes the string `x` to the file `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, the string `x` is printed to the standard output. The value of `x` is the first string in `args`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `x` is the first string in `args`, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, the string `x` is printed to the standard output.**
