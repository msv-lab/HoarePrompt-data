Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of at least 2 strings where each string is one of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', and `s` must have at least two elements; if the string `i` is 'TLE', `tle` is incremented by 1 (if `i` was 'TLE' in the if part, `tle` is incremented by 1; if `i` was 'TLE' in the else part, `re` is set to 2); if the string `i` is 'RE', `re` is set to 2; otherwise, the values of `ac`, `wa`, and `tle` remain unchanged and `re` remains unchanged if `i` is neither 'TLE' nor 'RE'.***
