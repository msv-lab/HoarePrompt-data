Postcondition: ***`args` is a variable number of strings, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, and the output buffer of `sys.stdout` has been flushed if the keyword argument `flush` is `True`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
