The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be either a tuple or a list containing exactly two elements, where the second element is an integer representing the height of a tower. After executing, the function returns the integer value representing the height of the tower from the second element of `item`. There are no edge cases to consider since the code does not handle any exceptional scenarios or validate the type of `item` beyond ensuring it contains exactly two elements.
