The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `l`, where each integer represents the height of a tower that can be formed using two-block and three-block pieces. The function sorts the list in descending order based on the values of these integers and returns the sorted list. This means that the highest tower height comes first in the returned list. The function does not modify the original list; instead, it returns a new sorted list.
