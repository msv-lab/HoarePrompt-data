The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where \(0 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\)) and returns a list of its digits as integers. Specifically, the function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This process handles the conversion of each digit of `n` into an integer without any loss or modification of the original digits. The function will correctly handle the edge case where `n` is 0, returning a list containing a single element `[0]`.
