The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` with the constraint \(0 \leq r \leq n\). It calculates and returns the value of \(\frac{\text{factorial}(n)}{\text{factorial}(r) \times \text{factorial}(n - r)}\), which corresponds to the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{r}\). The function does not handle edge cases where `n` or `r` are negative or where \(r > n\); these should be validated before calling the function. If `n` or `r` are out of bounds, the function will raise an error when attempting to compute the factorials.
