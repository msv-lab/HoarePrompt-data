The function `func_10` accepts a positive integer `x` and checks whether `x` is a power of two. It returns `True` if `x` is a power of two, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the bitwise operation `x & (x - 1)` to determine if `x` is a power of two. Specifically, if `x` is a power of two, then `x & (x - 1)` will be `0`, and the function returns `True`. If `x` is not a power of two, `x & (x - 1)` will not be `0`, and the function returns `False`. This method correctly handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `x = 1` (which is a power of two) and `x = 0` (which is not a valid input as per the initial condition but should be noted).
