The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returning `False` if true. Then it checks if `n` is less than or equal to 3, returning `True` if true. Next, it checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if true. Finally, it enters a loop that iterates over potential divisors starting from 5, checking if `n` is divisible by these numbers or their consecutive offset by 2. If no divisors are found up to the square root of `n`, the function returns `True`. If any of the previous conditions are met, the function returns `False`.
