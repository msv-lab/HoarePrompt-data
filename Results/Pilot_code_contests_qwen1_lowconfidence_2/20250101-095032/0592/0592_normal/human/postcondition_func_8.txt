The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a nested list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the integer `num`. The function handles the case where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), and `num` is either 2 or 3. After executing the function, the program concludes with the state that a nested list has been created with the specified dimensions (`n` rows and `m` columns), and every element within this list is set to the value of `num`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; it correctly generates the desired nested list as described.
