The function `func_4()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from standard input and returns them as a list of two strings. There are no parameters required for this function. Potential edge cases include the scenario where the input does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers, in which case the function will raise an error. The function does not handle such cases internally; instead, it relies on the input being correctly formatted.
