The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the computation, the function returns `x` (the GCD) and sets `y` to 0. This process handles all cases where both `x` and `y` are positive integers, including when `x` is equal to `y`, when one of them is larger than the other, and when they are relatively prime. The function does not handle cases where either `x` or `y` is not a positive integer, as these would result in a TypeError due to the modulus operation.
