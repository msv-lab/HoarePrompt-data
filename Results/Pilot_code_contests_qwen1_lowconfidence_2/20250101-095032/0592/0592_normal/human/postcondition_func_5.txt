This function sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread and starts the execution of the `main` function within that thread. It does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. After the function concludes, a new thread is running the `main` function with the specified recursion limit and stack size set. If the `main` function encounters a recursion depth exceeding 100,000,000 or a stack size exceeding 40,960,000 bytes, it may encounter errors. There is no explicit handling of these potential edge cases within the provided code.
