The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. This integer represents either the number of students using two-block pieces (`n`) or the number of students using three-block pieces (`m`), with the constraints that both `n` and `m` are within the range 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and their sum is greater than zero (n + m > 0). If the user inputs a value outside the specified range, the function will still return the value, but it will not validate the constraints internally. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the input adheres to the given constraints.
