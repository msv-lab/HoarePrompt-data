The function `func_3()` reads a space-separated string of non-negative integers from user input, converts these integers into a map object, and ensures that each integer is less than or equal to 1,000,000 and their sum is greater than 0. If the input does not meet these criteria, the function will continue to prompt the user until valid input is provided.
