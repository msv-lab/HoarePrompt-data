You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.

Examples

Input

1 3


Output

9


Input

3 2


Output

8


Input

5 0


Output

10

Note

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not implement the logic to find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers. Instead, it appears to be reading input and printing some values without processing the actual problem. Specifically, the function `func_19` attempts to iterate over numbers up to 1,000,000 and check conditions that do not align with the problem description. It prints `i` when certain conditions are met, but these conditions do not ensure that the minimum height is found.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Calculate the minimum possible height for towers built with 2-block pieces.
2. Calculate the minimum possible height for towers built with 3-block pieces.
3. Ensure that all students have unique tower heights.
4. Return the height of the tallest tower.

Here is an example where the program would fail:

For input:
```
2 2
```

The expected output is:
```
7
```

However, the current implementation will not produce the correct output.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the final output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided information.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, specifically, \( n \geq 4 \).
    #- `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.
    #- `i` is initialized to 5.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #The loop runs as long as \( i \times i \leq n \). For each iteration:
    #1. It checks if \( n \) is divisible by \( i \) or \( i + 2 \).
    #2. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
    #3. Otherwise, it increments `i` by 6 and continues the loop.
    #
    #### Observations from Example Outputs
    #- After 1 iteration, \( n \) must be greater than or equal to 25 and not divisible by any \( i \) in the range from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} - 1 \) and \( i + 2 \).
    #- After 2 iterations, \( n \) must be greater than or equal to \((i + 6)^2\) and not divisible by \( i \) or \( i + 2 \).
    #- After 3 iterations, \( n \) is greater than or equal to \((i + 12)^2\).
    #
    #### Final Analysis
    #The loop continues until \( i \times i > n \). This means that after the loop completes, \( i \) will be such that \( i \times i > n \), and \( i \) will be incremented to the smallest possible value satisfying this condition.
    #
    #Given that \( i \) starts at 5 and increases by 6 each iteration, the loop will continue until \( i \) reaches a value where \( i \times i > n \). The value of \( i \) will be just above \( \sqrt{n} \), and it will be in the form of \( 6k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \).
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #After the loop has executed, \( n \) will be such that there are no divisors \( i \) in the range from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} - 1 \) and \( i + 2 \) that divide \( n \). The value of \( i \) will be the smallest integer greater than \( \sqrt{n} \) in the form of \( 6k + 5 \).
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, specifically, \( n \geq 4 \), not divisible by 2, not divisible by 3, and no integer \( i \) in the range from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} - 1 \) divides \( n \) or \( n \) is not divisible by \( i + 2 \); `i` is the smallest integer greater than \( \sqrt{n} \) in the form of \( 6k + 5 \).**
