Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not implement the logic to find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers. Instead, it appears to be reading input and printing some values without processing the actual problem. Specifically, the function `func_19` attempts to iterate over numbers up to 1,000,000 and check conditions that do not align with the problem description. It prints `i` when certain conditions are met, but these conditions do not ensure that the minimum height is found.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Calculate the minimum possible height for towers built with 2-block pieces.
2. Calculate the minimum possible height for towers built with 3-block pieces.
3. Ensure that all students have unique tower heights.
4. Return the height of the tallest tower.

Here is an example where the program would fail:

For input:
```
2 2
```

The expected output is:
```
7
```

However, the current implementation will not produce the correct output.
