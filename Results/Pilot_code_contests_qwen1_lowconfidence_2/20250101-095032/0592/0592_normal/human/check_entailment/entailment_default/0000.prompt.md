You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Students in a class are making towers of blocks. Each student makes a (non-zero) tower by stacking pieces lengthwise on top of each other. n of the students use pieces made of two blocks and m of the students use pieces made of three blocks.

The students don’t want to use too many blocks, but they also want to be unique, so no two students’ towers may contain the same number of blocks. Find the minimum height necessary for the tallest of the students' towers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000, n + m > 0) — the number of students using two-block pieces and the number of students using three-block pieces, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, denoting the minimum possible height of the tallest tower.

Examples

Input

1 3


Output

9


Input

3 2


Output

8


Input

5 0


Output

10

Note

In the first case, the student using two-block pieces can make a tower of height 4, and the students using three-block pieces can make towers of height 3, 6, and 9 blocks. The tallest tower has a height of 9 blocks.

In the second case, the students can make towers of heights 2, 4, and 8 with two-block pieces and towers of heights 3 and 6 with three-block pieces, for a maximum height of 8 blocks.

    func_19()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns it. This integer represents either the number of students using two-block pieces (`n`) or the number of students using three-block pieces (`m`), with the constraints that both `n` and `m` are within the range 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and their sum is greater than zero (n + m > 0). If the user inputs a value outside the specified range, the function will still return the value, but it will not validate the constraints internally. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the input adheres to the given constraints.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from the user, where \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). After reading the input, it returns a string containing these integers separated by a space. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not handle any specific exceptions. The function assumes valid input within the specified range.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` reads a space-separated string of non-negative integers from user input, converts these integers into a map object, and ensures that each integer is less than or equal to 1,000,000 and their sum is greater than 0. If the input does not meet these criteria, the function will continue to prompt the user until valid input is provided.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from standard input and returns them as a list of two strings. There are no parameters required for this function. Potential edge cases include the scenario where the input does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers, in which case the function will raise an error. The function does not handle such cases internally; instead, it relies on the input being correctly formatted.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by calling the function `func_3()`. After executing, the program will return a list that is the result of whatever `func_3()` does. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided code, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. However, the function `func_5` guarantees that the output will always be a list. There are no specific actions performed by `func_5` itself other than invoking `func_3()` and returning its result.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  This function sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread and starts the execution of the `main` function within that thread. It does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. After the function concludes, a new thread is running the `main` function with the specified recursion limit and stack size set. If the `main` function encounters a recursion depth exceeding 100,000,000 or a stack size exceeding 40,960,000 bytes, it may encounter errors. There is no explicit handling of these potential edge cases within the provided code.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be either a tuple or a list containing exactly two elements, where the second element is an integer representing the height of a tower. After executing, the function returns the integer value representing the height of the tower from the second element of `item`. There are no edge cases to consider since the code does not handle any exceptional scenarios or validate the type of `item` beyond ensuring it contains exactly two elements.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `l`, where each integer represents the height of a tower that can be formed using two-block and three-block pieces. The function sorts the list in descending order based on the values of these integers and returns the sorted list. This means that the highest tower height comes first in the returned list. The function does not modify the original list; instead, it returns a new sorted list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a nested list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the integer `num`. The function handles the case where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\), and `num` is either 2 or 3. After executing the function, the program concludes with the state that a nested list has been created with the specified dimensions (`n` rows and `m` columns), and every element within this list is set to the value of `num`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; it correctly generates the desired nested list as described.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a positive integer `x` and checks whether `x` is a power of two. It returns `True` if `x` is a power of two, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the bitwise operation `x & (x - 1)` to determine if `x` is a power of two. Specifically, if `x` is a power of two, then `x & (x - 1)` will be `0`, and the function returns `True`. If `x` is not a power of two, `x & (x - 1)` will not be `0`, and the function returns `False`. This method correctly handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `x = 1` (which is a power of two) and `x = 0` (which is not a valid input as per the initial condition but should be noted).
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where \(0 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\) and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly converts the integer to a binary string and removes the '0b' prefix. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code; it performs the required task accurately. After the function concludes, the program state includes a binary string representing the input integer `n`.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where \(0 \leq n \leq 1,000,000\)) and returns a list of its digits as integers. Specifically, the function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This process handles the conversion of each digit of `n` into an integer without any loss or modification of the original digits. The function will correctly handle the edge case where `n` is 0, returning a list containing a single element `[0]`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` with the constraint \(0 \leq r \leq n\). It calculates and returns the value of \(\frac{\text{factorial}(n)}{\text{factorial}(r) \times \text{factorial}(n - r)}\), which corresponds to the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{r}\). The function does not handle edge cases where `n` or `r` are negative or where \(r > n\); these should be validated before calling the function. If `n` or `r` are out of bounds, the function will raise an error when attempting to compute the factorials.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` such that `x >= y` and `x + y > 0`. It returns `x // y` if `x` is divisible by `y`, otherwise it returns `(x // y + 1)`. This covers both cases where `x % y == 0` and `x % y != 0`. The function ensures that the returned value is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of `x / y`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It calculates and returns the result of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. The function uses a loop to efficiently compute this using the method of exponentiation by squaring. Specifically, it reduces `x` modulo `p` at the start, then iteratively squares `x` and updates the result based on whether the current bit of `y` is set. The function handles the case where `y` is zero by immediately returning `res` as `1`. If `y` is odd, it multiplies `res` by the current value of `x` before squaring `x`. After the loop completes, the function returns `res`, which is the correct modular exponentiation result. The function does not handle negative exponents or non-integer inputs for `x`, `y`, or `p`.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the computation, the function returns `x` (the GCD) and sets `y` to 0. This process handles all cases where both `x` and `y` are positive integers, including when `x` is equal to `y`, when one of them is larger than the other, and when they are relatively prime. The function does not handle cases where either `x` or `y` is not a positive integer, as these would result in a TypeError due to the modulus operation.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, returning `False` if true. Then it checks if `n` is less than or equal to 3, returning `True` if true. Next, it checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if true. Finally, it enters a loop that iterates over potential divisors starting from 5, checking if `n` is divisible by these numbers or their consecutive offset by 2. If no divisors are found up to the square root of `n`, the function returns `True`. If any of the previous conditions are met, the function returns `False`.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18()` modifies the standard input and output streams to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. After executing this function, the standard input is redirected to 'input.txt' and the standard output is redirected to 'output.txt'. This means that any subsequent print statements or input() calls within the program will read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt' respectively. There are no return values, and the function does not modify any external variables or perform any other operations besides setting the standard streams.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    (n, m) = func_3()
    for i in range(1, 1000001):
        if n <= i // 2 and m <= i // 3 and (n + m <= i // 2 + i // 2 - i // 6):
            func_20(i)
            break
''' 

 Output hints for function19:  The function `func_19` accepts no parameters. It initializes `n` and `m` by calling another function `func_3()`. The function then iterates over a range from 1 to 1,000,000. For each iteration, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to half of the current index `i`, `m` is less than or equal to one-third of `i`, and the sum of `n` and `m` is less than or equal to half of `i` plus half of `i` minus one-sixth of `i`. If these conditions are met, it calls `func_20()` with the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop. After the loop, the state of `n` and `m` is either both set to 0 if the loop was executed, or they retain their original values if the loop did not execute. The function does not explicitly return any value, but its effect is seen in the updated values of `n` and `m`.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20(*args, **kwargs):

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function20:  The function `func_20()` accepts no parameters and does not return any values. Its primary action is to print the elements of the `args` iterable to the specified `file` stream, using the specified `sep` (separator) between elements. If the `end` parameter is provided, it appends the `end` value to the output. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it flushes the file buffer. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by popping the `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` keys. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `at_start` is always `False`, and the `kwargs` dictionary no longer contains the `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` keys. The `sep` and `file` values retain their original values from before the function call, unless explicitly modified within the function.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
