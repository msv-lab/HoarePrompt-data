The function `func_18()` modifies the standard input and output streams to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. After executing this function, the standard input is redirected to 'input.txt' and the standard output is redirected to 'output.txt'. This means that any subsequent print statements or input() calls within the program will read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt' respectively. There are no return values, and the function does not modify any external variables or perform any other operations besides setting the standard streams.
