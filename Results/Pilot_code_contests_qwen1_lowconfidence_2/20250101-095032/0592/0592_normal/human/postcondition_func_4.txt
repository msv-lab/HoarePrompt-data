The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by calling the function `func_3()`. After executing, the program will return a list that is the result of whatever `func_3()` does. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided code, the exact content of the returned list cannot be determined. However, the function `func_5` guarantees that the output will always be a list. There are no specific actions performed by `func_5` itself other than invoking `func_3()` and returning its result.
