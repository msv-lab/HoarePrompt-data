The function `func_2()` reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from the user, where \(0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000\) and \(n + m > 0\). After reading the input, it returns a string containing these integers separated by a space. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not handle any specific exceptions. The function assumes valid input within the specified range.
