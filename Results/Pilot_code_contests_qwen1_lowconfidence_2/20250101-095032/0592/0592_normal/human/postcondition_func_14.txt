The function `func_15` takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It calculates and returns the result of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. The function uses a loop to efficiently compute this using the method of exponentiation by squaring. Specifically, it reduces `x` modulo `p` at the start, then iteratively squares `x` and updates the result based on whether the current bit of `y` is set. The function handles the case where `y` is zero by immediately returning `res` as `1`. If `y` is odd, it multiplies `res` by the current value of `x` before squaring `x`. After the loop completes, the function returns `res`, which is the correct modular exponentiation result. The function does not handle negative exponents or non-integer inputs for `x`, `y`, or `p`.
