The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` impacts the program by popping the values associated with the keys 'sep' and 'file' from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the keys exist in `kwargs`, their values are assigned to `sep` and `file`, respectively. If the keys do not exist, default values ' ' for `sep` and `sys.stdout` for `file` are used.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `kwargs`, we assume that `kwargs` could potentially contain these keys or not. After executing the code, `kwargs` will have had the 'sep' and 'file' keys popped if they existed.

Output State: **`kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`**
