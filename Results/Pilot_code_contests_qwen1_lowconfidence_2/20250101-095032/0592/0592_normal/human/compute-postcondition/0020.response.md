`kwargs` had the key `'end'` with a default value of `\n`. The code pops the value associated with `'end'` from `kwargs` and writes it to `file`. Since `'end'` was the only key in `kwargs` related to this operation and its value is `\n`, `kwargs` will no longer contain the key `'end'`. The value of `file.write` is not relevant to the output state.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'end' key, `sep` retains its original value from the initial state, `file` retains its original value from the initial state**
