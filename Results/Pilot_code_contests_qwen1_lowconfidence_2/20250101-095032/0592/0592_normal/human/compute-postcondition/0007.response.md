`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file specified by `file`. Since `file.write(sep)` has already been executed, the file is already open and set to write `sep`. Writing `str(x)` to the file does not affect the values of `at_start`, `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`. The only change is that `x` is now converted to its string representation and written to the file.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, and `file.write(str(x))` has been executed.**
