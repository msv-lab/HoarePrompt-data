The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. Since the initial state includes that `file.write(sep)` has been executed, the value of `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, and `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, this operation will write `str(x)` to the same file.

The states of the other variables (`at_start`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, and `file.write(str(x))` has been executed.**
