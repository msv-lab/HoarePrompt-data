The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was its initial value. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The conditions about `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`**
