`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object referenced by `file`. Since `at_start` is initially `False` and this condition does not affect the execution of the code, `at_start` remains `False`. The `kwargs` dictionary does not contain the keys `'sep'` or `'file'`, so these remain unaffected. The value of `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, and `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`. The length of `args` decreases by one, but the specific elements are not relevant to the current code execution. The only change is that `x` is converted to a string and written to the `file`.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `args` has one fewer element, `file` contains the string representation of `x`.**
