Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `args` has one fewer element. Since the condition `not at_start` is always true based on the precondition, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
