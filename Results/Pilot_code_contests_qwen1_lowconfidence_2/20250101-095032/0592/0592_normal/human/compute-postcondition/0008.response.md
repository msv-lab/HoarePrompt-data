The code `at_start = False` sets the variable `at_start` to `False`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`**
