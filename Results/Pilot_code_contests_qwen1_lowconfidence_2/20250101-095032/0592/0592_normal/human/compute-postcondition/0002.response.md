The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`at_start` is True, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`**
