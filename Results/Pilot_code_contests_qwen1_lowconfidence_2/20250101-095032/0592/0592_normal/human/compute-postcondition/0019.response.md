Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` retains its original value from the initial state, `file` retains its original value from the initial state.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `at_start` is True.
   - `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys.
   - `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`.
   - `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `args` and writes each element to `file`.
   - If `at_start` is `False`, it writes `sep` to `file` before writing the current element.
   - `at_start` is set to `False` after the first iteration, ensuring it remains `False` for all subsequent iterations.

3. **Final Values After Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop runs until all elements in `args` are processed, `at_start` will always be `False` after the loop completes.
   - `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped) because the loop does not modify these variables.
   - `sep` retains its original value from the initial state because the loop only uses `sep` for writing, and there is no indication that `sep` is being modified within the loop.
   - `file` retains its original value from the initial state for the same reason as `sep`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop are completed is as described above.
