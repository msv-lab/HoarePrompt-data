Let's break down the given state and the for loop to understand how the states should be modified for the next iteration.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `at_start` is `False`
- `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped)
- `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`
- `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`

### For Loop:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of the Loop**: 
   - The loop starts with the first element of `args`.
   - At the start of the loop, `x` is set to the first element of `args`.

2. **Loop Body Execution**:
   - The loop body is executed with `x` as the current element of `args`.
   - After the loop body is executed, `x` will be set to the next element of `args`.

3. **End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Since `at_start` was `False` at the beginning of the loop, this means that the loop has already executed at least once.
   - `x` is now set to the second element of `args` (since it started with the first element).
   - `kwargs` still does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys, or their values have been popped.
   - `sep` remains either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`.
   - `file` remains either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be set to the third element of `args`.
   - `kwargs` should still not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys, or their values have been popped.
   - `sep` should remain either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`.
   - `file` should remain either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration:
- `at_start` is `False` (unchanged)
- `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped) (unchanged)
- `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs` (unchanged)
- `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs` (unchanged)

State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`**
