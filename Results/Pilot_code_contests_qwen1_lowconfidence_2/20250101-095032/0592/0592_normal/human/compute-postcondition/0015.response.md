The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object referenced by `file`. Given the initial state, `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, and `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`. The code does not change the value of `sep` or `file`, but it uses these values.

- `at_start` remains `False`.
- `kwargs` remains unchanged since it doesn't contain 'sep' and 'file', and the code does not add or modify these keys.
- `sep` remains either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`.
- `file` remains either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.
- `args` having one fewer element is not directly related to the execution of this line of code and thus remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `args` has one fewer element**
