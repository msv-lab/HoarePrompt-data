`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Since `sep` is either `' '` or a value from `kwargs`, and `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, the output state will include these values being used in the write operation.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, file.write(sep) has been executed**
