The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object referenced by `file`. Since `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, and `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, the value of `sep` and `file` remains unchanged in terms of their types and values, but the action of writing `sep` to `file` occurs.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `file.write(sep)` has been executed**
