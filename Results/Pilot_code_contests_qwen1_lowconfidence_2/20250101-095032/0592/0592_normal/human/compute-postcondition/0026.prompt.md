You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and `n` is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the final output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided information.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, specifically, \( n \geq 4 \).
    #- `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.
    #- `i` is initialized to 5.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #The loop runs as long as \( i \times i \leq n \). For each iteration:
    #1. It checks if \( n \) is divisible by \( i \) or \( i + 2 \).
    #2. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
    #3. Otherwise, it increments `i` by 6 and continues the loop.
    #
    #### Observations from Example Outputs
    #- After 1 iteration, \( n \) must be greater than or equal to 25 and not divisible by any \( i \) in the range from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} - 1 \) and \( i + 2 \).
    #- After 2 iterations, \( n \) must be greater than or equal to \((i + 6)^2\) and not divisible by \( i \) or \( i + 2 \).
    #- After 3 iterations, \( n \) is greater than or equal to \((i + 12)^2\).
    #
    #### Final Analysis
    #The loop continues until \( i \times i > n \). This means that after the loop completes, \( i \) will be such that \( i \times i > n \), and \( i \) will be incremented to the smallest possible value satisfying this condition.
    #
    #Given that \( i \) starts at 5 and increases by 6 each iteration, the loop will continue until \( i \) reaches a value where \( i \times i > n \). The value of \( i \) will be just above \( \sqrt{n} \), and it will be in the form of \( 6k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \).
    #
    #### Conclusion
    #After the loop has executed, \( n \) will be such that there are no divisors \( i \) in the range from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} - 1 \) and \( i + 2 \) that divide \( n \). The value of \( i \) will be the smallest integer greater than \( \sqrt{n} \) in the form of \( 6k + 5 \).
    #
    #### Output State
    #**Output State: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, specifically, \( n \geq 4 \), not divisible by 2, not divisible by 3, and no integer \( i \) in the range from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} - 1 \) divides \( n \) or \( n \) is not divisible by \( i + 2 \); `i` is the smallest integer greater than \( \sqrt{n} \) in the form of \( 6k + 5 \).**
    return True
    #`True`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_17` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. Based on the conditions provided, the function returns `False` in cases 1 through 6 and returns `True` in case 7. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_17` is to accept a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and return `True` if a specific condition is met (which is only true for a particular value of `n`), otherwise it returns `False`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns True

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns False

Case_5: The program returns False

Case_6: The program returns False

Case_7: `True`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
