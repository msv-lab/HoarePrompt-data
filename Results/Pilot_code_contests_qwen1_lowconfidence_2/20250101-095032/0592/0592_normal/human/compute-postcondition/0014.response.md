According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `args`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element left in `args`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were observed:
- `at_start` is `False`
- `kwargs` does not contain the keys 'sep' and 'file', or these keys have been popped
- `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`
- `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`

For the loop to continue executing, `args` must still contain elements. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `args` now contains one fewer element.

Let's summarize the new state:

- `at_start` remains `False` because the loop's initial state is not relevant here.
- `kwargs` continues to not contain the keys 'sep' and 'file', or these keys have been popped.
- `sep` remains either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`.
- `file` remains either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`.

State: **`at_start` is False, `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file' keys (or their respective values are popped), `sep` is either ' ' or a value from `kwargs`, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value from `kwargs`, `args` has one fewer element**
