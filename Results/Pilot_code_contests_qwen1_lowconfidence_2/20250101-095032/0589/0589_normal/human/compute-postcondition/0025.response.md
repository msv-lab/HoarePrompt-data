Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `a` is `l`.
- `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \).
- `r` is the same as before.

### For Loop:
```
for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `b`:**
   - The initial value of `b` is defined as the maximum integer within the range \([a, r]\) that satisfies two conditions:
     - \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \)
     - \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \)

2. **Range of the For Loop:**
   - The for loop iterates over the integers from `a + 1` to `r`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `b` is within the range `[a + 1, r]`.

### Steps to Adjust the States:
- **Initial State of `b`:**
  - We need to ensure that `b` is correctly set according to the given conditions.
  - Specifically, `b` should be the maximum integer such that:
    - \( a \leq b \leq r \)
    - \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \)
    - \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \)

- **Range Adjustment:**
  - Since the loop starts at `a + 1` and goes up to `r`, we need to ensure that `b` is within this range.

### Final State After Initialization:
- `a` remains `l`.
- `b` is set to the maximum integer satisfying the conditions mentioned above.
- `r` remains the same.

### Final State for Loop Execution:
- To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `b` is set correctly and within the range \([a + 1, r]\).

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `b` must be the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \).

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is `l`, `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \), `r` is the same as before**
