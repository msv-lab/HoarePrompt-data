Output State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the maximum integer such that `a <= b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is the same as before.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range starting from `a + 1` up to `r`.
- It checks the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1`.
- If the condition is met, it returns the values of `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- Since the loop continues to iterate until it finds such a `b` (or until it reaches `r`), the final value of `b` will be the largest integer within the specified range that satisfies the condition.

If the loop does not execute at all (which would happen if no `b` in the range satisfies the condition), the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` remain as they were initially set: `a = r + 1`, `b` can be any value depending on the initial state, and `r` remains unchanged. However, based on the problem statement, the primary concern is understanding the state when the loop does execute, which leads to the above conclusion.
