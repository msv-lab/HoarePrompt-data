Output State: **`a` is `l`, `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \), `r` is the same as before.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is `l`.
   - `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \).
   - `r` is the same as before.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
       if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
           return a, b, r
   ```

3. **Observation from Provided Output States**:
   - After the loop executes 1 time, `b` becomes the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) \neq 1 \) or \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) == 1 \).
   - After the loop executes 2 times, `b` decreases by 1 (becomes \( b - 1 \)), and the condition still holds.
   - After the loop executes 3 times, `b` becomes `l + 2`, and the condition still holds.

4. **Final Iterations**:
   - The loop continues until it finds an integer `b` within the range `[a + 1, r]` that satisfies the condition \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \).
   - Once such a `b` is found, the loop terminates and returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - If the loop executes at least once, `b` will be the maximum integer within the range `[a + 1, r]` that satisfies the given conditions.
   - If the loop does not execute, `b` remains `l` because no other integer within the range `[a + 1, r]` satisfies the conditions.

Thus, the final output state of the loop after all iterations is that `a` remains `l`, `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[a + 1, r]` that satisfies the condition \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \), and `r` remains the same as before.
