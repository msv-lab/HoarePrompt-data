To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Loop Analysis

#### Initial Conditions:
- `l` and `r` are positive integers such that `1 <= l <= r` and `r - l <= 50`.
- `a` and `b` are integers within the range `[l, r]` where `a < b`.
- `func_5` returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its two arguments.

#### Loop Code:
```python
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
        if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
            return a, b, r
```

### Observations from Given States:
1. **After 1 Execution**:
   - If the function returns, it means there exists at least one pair `(a, b)` that satisfies the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
   - If the function does not return, `a`, `b`, and `r` are undefined.

2. **After 2 Executions**:
   - If the function does not return, `a` becomes `r + 1` and `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies the condition.
   - This suggests that if the function does not return after the first iteration, it will continue to search until it finds a valid pair or exhausts all possibilities.

3. **After 3 Executions**:
   - Similar to the previous observation, if the function does not return, `a` remains `l` and `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies the condition.
   - This indicates that if no valid pair is found starting from `l`, the loop will check the next possible value of `a`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will either find a valid pair `(a, b)` that satisfies the condition and return it, or it will not return if no such pair exists.
- If the loop does not return, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `r` will depend on whether the conditions are met during the last iteration.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop returns, `a`, `b`, and `r` will be such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
- If the loop does not return, `a` and `b` will be undefined, and `r` will remain the same as the input value.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `r` are such that if the function returns, `a`, `b`, and `r` satisfy `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If the function does not return, `a` and `b` are undefined, and `r` remains the same as the input value.**
