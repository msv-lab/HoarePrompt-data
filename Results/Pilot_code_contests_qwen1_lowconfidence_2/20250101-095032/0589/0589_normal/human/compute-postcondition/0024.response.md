To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop condition:

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is `r + 1`
- `b` is the maximum integer such that `a <= b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`
- `r` is the same as before

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `a` in the range `l` to `r + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `a`:**
   - The current value of `a` is `r + 1`.
   
2. **Range Condition for the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `a` in the range from `l` to `r + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must be within this range, i.e., `l <= a <= r`.

3. **Value of `a` at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `a` starts at `r + 1` in the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `a` must change to a value within the range `[l, r]`.
   - Therefore, `a` must be set to `l` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Value of `b` and `r`:**
   - The values of `b` and `r` remain unchanged because the loop modifies only the value of `a`.

### Updated States:
- `a` must be set to `l` (the lower bound of the range).
- `b` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `r` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is `l`, `b` is the maximum integer such that `a <= b <= r` and `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is the same as before**
