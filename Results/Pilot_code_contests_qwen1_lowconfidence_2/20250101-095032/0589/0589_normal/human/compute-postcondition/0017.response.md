Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` is `r + 1`
   - `b` is `a + 1`
   - `r` is the same as before
   - Either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `b` from `a + 1` to `r`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was `a + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `b` needs to be within the range `(a + 1, r + 1)`.
   - Since `b` starts at `a + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `b` would be `a + 2`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `a` remains unchanged and is still `r + 1`.
   - `b` changes to `a + 2`.
   - `r` remains the same.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1` needs to be checked again with the new value of `b`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `a + 2`, `r` is the same as before, and either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`**
