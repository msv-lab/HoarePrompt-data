Postcondition: ***`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is less than `r`, and `b` is `a + 1`. If `func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1`, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything since there is no else part provided.***
