To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions for the loop to continue:

### Given Information:
- `l` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).
- `a` is less than `r`.
- The condition `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1` holds true at the end of the previous iteration.

### Loop Details:
The loop iterates over `b` from `a + 1` to `r`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute another iteration, the value of `b` should be within the range `a + 1` to `r`. 

2. **Current Values at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` was the last value of `b` used in the loop.
   - Let's denote the last value of `b` as `b_last`.
   - Since the loop just ended, `b_last` is `r` because if `b` was incremented beyond `r`, the loop would have terminated.

3. **New Value of `b`**:
   - For the loop to continue, the next value of `b` (let's call it `b_new`) must be `a + 1`.

4. **Checking the Condition Again**:
   - The condition `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1` needs to be checked with the new value of `b`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments are needed:
- `b` should be set to `a + 1`.
- The condition `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1` should still hold true with `b = a + 1`.

### Final State:
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` is now `a + 1`.

State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is less than `r`, and `b` is `a + 1`**.
