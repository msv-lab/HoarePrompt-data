To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `l` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).

### Loop Information:
```
for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `l` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).
   - `a` is an unknown variable, and its initial value is not specified.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for b in range(a + 1, r + 1)` will execute if the range `(a + 1, r + 1)` contains at least one element.
   - This means \(a + 1 \leq r\).

3. **Initial Values and Constraints:**
   - Since `r` is constrained by \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\), we know that \(r \leq 50 + l\).
   - For the loop to execute, \(a\) must be less than or equal to \(r - 1\). That is, \(a < r\).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the condition \(a < r\) is met for the loop to execute.
   - Additionally, since the range starts from `a + 1`, \(a\) should be less than \(r\).

### Conclusion:
The initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute based on the provided constraints. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- `l` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).
- `a` must be less than \(r\).

### Final State:
State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` must be less than \(r\)**
