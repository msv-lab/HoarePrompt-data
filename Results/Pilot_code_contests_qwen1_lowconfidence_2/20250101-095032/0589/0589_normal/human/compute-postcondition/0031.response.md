Postcondition: ***`a` is `l`, `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b - 1 \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b - 1) \neq 1 \) or \( \text{func\_5}(b - 1, a) == 1 \), and `r` is the same as before. If `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, these conditions hold. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.***
