Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `l` and `r` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).
   - `a` and `b` are integers within the range \([l, r]\) where \(a < b\).
   - The function `func_5` returns an integer indicating the GCD of its two arguments.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `a` from `l` to `r` inclusive.
   - The loop condition for this range is \(l \leq a \leq r\).

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each value of `a` in the specified range, the loop body is executed.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, the range \([l, r]\) must contain at least one integer. Since \(1 \leq l \leq r\), there is always at least one integer in the range.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` must satisfy \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).
   - Since the loop iterates over all integers from `l` to `r`, we need to ensure that the range is valid and non-empty.

### Conclusion:

The only states that need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute are the conditions on `l` and `r`. We don't need to adjust `a` or `b` because they are iterated over within the specified range, and their values will be determined by the loop itself.

### Final Answer:

State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\)**
