According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` satisfy either the condition where the function `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` holds true, or the function does not return and the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` are undefined.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop variable `a` starts from `l` and increments by 1 each time the loop iterates.
2. The loop will continue as long as `a` is within the range `[l, r]`.

Given that the loop just completed an iteration, the current value of `a` is `r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be incremented to `r + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` is now `r + 1`. The values of `b` and `r` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop variable `a`.

State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the same as before, `r` is the same as before**
