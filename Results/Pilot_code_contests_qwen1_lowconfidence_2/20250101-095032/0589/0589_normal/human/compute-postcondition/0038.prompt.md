You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l <= r and r - l <= 50. a and b are integers within the range [l, r] where a < b, and the function func_5 returns an integer indicating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its two arguments.
```
def func_6(l, r):
```
Output: Case_1: `The program returns a tuple containing the values of 'a', 'b', and 'r', where 'a' is less than 'r', and the function call `func_5(r, b)` returns 1 while `func_5(b, a)` does not return 1

Case_2: `The program returns a, b, and r where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + 1`, and `r` satisfies \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\)

Case_3: The program returns a, b, and r where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + 1` (or `a + k + 1` if `k` iterations have been completed), and `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\)

Case_4: `a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `a + 1`, `r` is the same as before

Case_5: `a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `a + 2`, `r` is the same as before

Case_6: `a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `a + 3`, and `r` remains the same

Case_7: `a` is `l`, `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \) and \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \), and `r` is the same as before

Case_8: `a` is `l`, `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b - 1 \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b - 1) \neq 1 \) or \( \text{func\_5}(b - 1, a) == 1 \), `r` is the same as before

Case_9: `a` is `l`, `b` is `l + 2`, and `r` is the same as before

Case_10: The program returns (-1, -1, -1)

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
