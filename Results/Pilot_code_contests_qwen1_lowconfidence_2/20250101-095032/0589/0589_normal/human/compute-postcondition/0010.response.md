Postcondition: ***`a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + 1` (or `a + k + 1` if `k` iterations have been completed), and `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). The function returns `a`, `b`, and `r` when the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1` is met. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
