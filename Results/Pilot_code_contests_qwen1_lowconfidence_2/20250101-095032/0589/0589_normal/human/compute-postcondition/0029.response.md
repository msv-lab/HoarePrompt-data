According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop iterates over the range from `a + 1` to `r`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

- `a` is `l`
- `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) \neq 1 \) or \( \text{func\_5}(b, a) == 1 \)
- `r` is the same as before

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be increased by 1 and still satisfy the condition for `b` within the range from `a + 1` to `r`.

Since `b` is the maximum integer satisfying the given conditions, the next possible value for `b` would be `b - 1`. However, it must still satisfy the condition for the next iteration.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` remains `l`
- `b` becomes `b - 1` (if it still satisfies the condition)
- `r` remains the same as before

To ensure the loop can continue, `b` must be the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b - 1 \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b - 1) \neq 1 \) or \( \text{func\_5}(b - 1, a) == 1 \).

State: **`a` is `l`, `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b - 1 \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b - 1) \neq 1 \) or \( \text{func\_5}(b - 1, a) == 1 \), `r` is the same as before**
