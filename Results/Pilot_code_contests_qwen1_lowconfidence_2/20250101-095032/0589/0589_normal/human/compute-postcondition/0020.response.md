Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is `r + 1`
   - `b` is `a + 2`
   - `r` is the same as before
   - The conditions `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` remain unchanged if they were true.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs over values of `b` from `a + 1` to `r`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was `a + 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `b` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, which would be `a + 3`.
   - The range specified is from `a + 1` to `r`, so the next valid value for `b` within this range would be `a + 3`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `a` remains the same (`r + 1`).
   - `b` should be set to `a + 3` to proceed to the next iteration.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - The conditions `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` still need to hold true for these new values of `b`.

Thus, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `a` is `r + 1`
- `b` is `a + 3`
- `r` is the same as before
- The conditions `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` still apply.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `a + 3`, `r` is the same as before, and if `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` the conditions remain unchanged.**
