According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is `l`.
- `b` is the maximum integer such that \( a \leq b - 1 \leq r \) and \( \text{func\_5}(r, b - 1) \neq 1 \) or \( \text{func\_5}(b - 1, a) == 1 \).
- `r` is the same as before.

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `b` must satisfy:
1. \( b + 1 \leq r \)
2. \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) \neq 1 \) (since the condition for stopping the loop is when \( \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \))

Given that the loop iterates over `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`, the next value of `b` will be `a + 2`.

Thus, we need to update the state as follows:

- `a` remains `l`.
- `b` is now `a + 2`.
- `r` remains the same as before.

State: **`a` is `l`, `b` is `a + 2`, and `r` is the same as before.**
