Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). It searches for integers `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a < b` and meets specific conditions related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculated by the function `func_5`. The function returns one of the following states based on the conditions met:

1. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `func_5(r, b) == 1`, and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
2. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + 1`, and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
3. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + k + 1` (where `k` is the number of iterations completed), and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
4. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1`.
5. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 1`.
6. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 3`.
7. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, l) != 1`.
8. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b - 1) != 1` or `func_5(b - 1, l) == 1`.
9. A tuple `(l, l + 2, r)` when no other conditions are met.

The function ensures that the returned values of `a` and `b` meet the specified GCD conditions and lie within the given range `[l, r]`, with the additional constraints on the difference between `r` and `l`.**

This summary covers all the potential cases mentioned in the return postconditions and also addresses any missing logic or edge cases that might arise during the execution of the function.
