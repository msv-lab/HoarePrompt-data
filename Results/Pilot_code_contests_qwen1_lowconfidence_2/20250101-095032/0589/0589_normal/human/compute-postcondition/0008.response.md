To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `l` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).
- `a` is less than `r`.
- `b` is `a + 1`.
- The function `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` should be true for the function to return `a`, `b`, and `r`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `a` is less than `r`.
   - `b` is `a + 1`.
   - The loop starts with `b = a + 1` and increments `b` by 1 in each iteration until `b` reaches `r`.

2. **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `r`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume the loop has just finished an iteration with `b` being the value it was incremented to before the current iteration started.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` would be `a + 1` (the initial value) plus some number of increments, meaning `b` is now `a + k` where `k` is the number of iterations completed so far.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `b` in the next iteration will be `a + k + 1`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` becomes `a + k + 1` where `k` is the number of iterations completed so far.
   - `r` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
Given the loop condition and the initial values, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

**State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is less than `r`, and `b` is `a + 1` (or `a + k + 1` if `k` iterations have been completed). For the loop to execute one more time, `b` should be `a + 1` (or `a + k + 1`) and it must be less than or equal to `r`.** 

Since `b` is initially `a + 1`, and for the next iteration, `b` becomes `a + 2` (assuming no other conditions stopped the loop earlier):

**State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is less than `r`, and `b` is `a + 2`.
