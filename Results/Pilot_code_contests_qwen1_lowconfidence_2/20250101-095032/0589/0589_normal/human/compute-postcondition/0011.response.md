To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop and the conditions under which it executes.

### Analysis of the Loop

The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`. For each iteration, it checks the condition:
\[ \text{if } \text{func\_5}(r, b) == 1 \text{ and } \text{func\_5}(b, a) != 1 \]

If this condition is satisfied, the function immediately returns the values `a`, `b`, and `r`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Values**: The initial values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b` are such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to iterate until it finds values of `b` that satisfy the condition.
   - If the condition is never satisfied, the loop will terminate without returning any values.

3. **Return Condition**:
   - When the loop finds `b` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, it returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
   - If no such `b` is found, the function will not return any values.

### Output State After All Iterations

- If the loop returns, the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` will be such that the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` is satisfied.
- If the loop does not return, the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` will not satisfy the condition, and the function will return `None`.

### Final Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state can be described as follows:

- If the function returns, `a`, `b`, and `r` will be such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
- If the function does not return, `a`, `b`, and `r` will be undefined or will not satisfy the condition.

### Formatted Output State

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `r` are such that either the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r` satisfying `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, or the function does not return and the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` are undefined.**
