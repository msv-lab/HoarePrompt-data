#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input within the range [l, r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and ensures that the input falls within the range [l, r]. If the input is within the specified range, it returns the integer input; otherwise, it may result in undefined behavior since no validation or error handling is performed for out-of-range inputs. The function does not perform any other operations and only returns the validated integer input. Potential edge cases include the user inputting a value outside the range [l, r], in which case the behavior is unspecified.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers generated by mapping int function over input split by spaces, where the input is provided by user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converting each integer to a list of integers. The function returns this list of integers. The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle cases where the input might be empty or contain non-integer values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing a sequence of digits such that the length of the string is at least 3 and the substring of the first three characters can form three distinct integers l, b, and c where l ≤ b < c ≤ r.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
    #The program returns a list containing each character of the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `s` consisting of digits as input and returns a list containing each character of the string `s`. There are no specific conditions on the length of the string or its content beyond it being a string of digits. The function does not perform any additional checks or operations on the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object created from converting the split input integers to int, but the specific values cannot be determined without input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers from standard input, splits them based on whitespace, converts each integer to a type `int`, and returns a map object containing these integers. The specific values of the integers cannot be determined without user input. There are no explicit edge cases handled within the function itself; thus, it relies on the input being valid integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is formatted incorrectly, a `ValueError` would be raised during the conversion process, which is not caught or handled within this function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b, and a and b are within the range [l, r] where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        
        a = b
        
        b = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is 0
    return b
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b` and both are within the range [l, r] with 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At the end of the loop, the value of `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, due to the return statement immediately following the loop, the function always returns 0, regardless of the computed GCD. This means the function effectively ignores the result of the GCD computation and always returns 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l <= r and r - l <= 50. a and b are integers within the range [l, r] where a < b, and the function func_5 returns an integer indicating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its two arguments.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a`, `b`, and `r` are such that if the function returns, `a`, `b`, and `r` satisfy `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If the function does not return, `a` and `b` are undefined, and `r` remains the same as the input value.
    return -1, -1, -1
    #The program returns (-1, -1, -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). It searches for integers `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a < b` and meets specific conditions related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculated by the function `func_5`. The function returns one of the following states based on the conditions met:

1. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `func_5(r, b) == 1`, and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
2. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + 1`, and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
3. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + k + 1` (where `k` is the number of iterations completed), and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
4. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1`.
5. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 1`.
6. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 3`.
7. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, l) != 1`.
8. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b - 1) != 1` or `func_5(b - 1, l) == 1`.
9. A tuple `(l, l + 2, r)` when no other conditions are met.

The function ensures that the returned values of `a` and `b` meet the specified GCD conditions and lie within the given range `[l, r]`, with the additional constraints on the difference between `r` and `l`.
