The function reads two integers from standard input, splits them based on whitespace, converts each integer to a type `int`, and returns a map object containing these integers. The specific values of the integers cannot be determined without user input. There are no explicit edge cases handled within the function itself; thus, it relies on the input being valid integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is formatted incorrectly, a `ValueError` would be raised during the conversion process, which is not caught or handled within this function.
