The function `func_5` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b` and both are within the range [l, r] with 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At the end of the loop, the value of `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, due to the return statement immediately following the loop, the function always returns 0, regardless of the computed GCD. This means the function effectively ignores the result of the GCD computation and always returns 0.
