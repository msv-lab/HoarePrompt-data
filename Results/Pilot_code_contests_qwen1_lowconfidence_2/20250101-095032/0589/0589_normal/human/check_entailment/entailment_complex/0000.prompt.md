You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input within the range [l, r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and ensures that the input falls within the range [l, r]. If the input is within the specified range, it returns the integer input; otherwise, it may result in undefined behavior since no validation or error handling is performed for out-of-range inputs. The function does not perform any other operations and only returns the validated integer input. Potential edge cases include the user inputting a value outside the range [l, r], in which case the behavior is unspecified.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers generated by mapping int function over input split by spaces, where the input is provided by user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converting each integer to a list of integers. The function returns this list of integers. The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle cases where the input might be empty or contain non-integer values.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing a sequence of digits such that the length of the string is at least 3 and the substring of the first three characters can form three distinct integers l, b, and c where l ≤ b < c ≤ r.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
    #The program returns a list containing each character of the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `s` consisting of digits as input and returns a list containing each character of the string `s`. There are no specific conditions on the length of the string or its content beyond it being a string of digits. The function does not perform any additional checks or operations on the input string.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object created from converting the split input integers to int, but the specific values cannot be determined without input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers from standard input, splits them based on whitespace, converts each integer to a type `int`, and returns a map object containing these integers. The specific values of the integers cannot be determined without user input. There are no explicit edge cases handled within the function itself; thus, it relies on the input being valid integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is formatted incorrectly, a `ValueError` would be raised during the conversion process, which is not caught or handled within this function.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b, and a and b are within the range [l, r] where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        
        a = b
        
        b = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is 0
    return b
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b` and both are within the range [l, r] with 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At the end of the loop, the value of `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, due to the return statement immediately following the loop, the function always returns 0, regardless of the computed GCD. This means the function effectively ignores the result of the GCD computation and always returns 0.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l <= r and r - l <= 50. a and b are integers within the range [l, r] where a < b, and the function func_5 returns an integer indicating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its two arguments.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a`, `b`, and `r` are such that if the function returns, `a`, `b`, and `r` satisfy `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If the function does not return, `a` and `b` are undefined, and `r` remains the same as the input value.
    return -1, -1, -1
    #The program returns (-1, -1, -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). It searches for integers `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a < b` and meets specific conditions related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculated by the function `func_5`. The function returns one of the following states based on the conditions met:

1. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `func_5(r, b) == 1`, and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
2. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + 1`, and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
3. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + k + 1` (where `k` is the number of iterations completed), and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
4. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1`.
5. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 1`.
6. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 3`.
7. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, l) != 1`.
8. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b - 1) != 1` or `func_5(b - 1, l) == 1`.
9. A tuple `(l, l + 2, r)` when no other conditions are met.

The function ensures that the returned values of `a` and `b` meet the specified GCD conditions and lie within the given range `[l, r]`, with the additional constraints on the difference between `r` and `l`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
