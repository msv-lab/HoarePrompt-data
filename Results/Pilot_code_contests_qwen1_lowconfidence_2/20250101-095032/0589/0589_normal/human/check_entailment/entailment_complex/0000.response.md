Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_5` incorrectly returns 0 instead of the actual GCD of its two arguments. This means that the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` will never be satisfied because `func_5` always returns 0, making the entire logic flawed.

To demonstrate this, consider the following case:
- Input: `l = 1` and `r = 10`
- Expected output: The program should find three distinct numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(1 \leq a < b < c \leq 10\), and the pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\) are coprime, while the pair \((a, c)\) is not coprime.

However, the current implementation will always return `-1` because `func_5` always returns 0, and the conditions inside `func_6` will never be met.

For example, when \(r = 10\) and \(b = 10\), `func_5(r, b)` will always return 0, and similarly, `func_5(b, a)` will always return 0 for any \(a < b\). Thus, the function `func_6` will never find valid \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the required conditions.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence the correctness is **False**.
