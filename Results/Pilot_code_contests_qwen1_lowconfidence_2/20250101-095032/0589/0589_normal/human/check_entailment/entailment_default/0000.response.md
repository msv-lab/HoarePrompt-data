Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly find a counterexample for the statement that if pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, then pair (a, c) is also coprime. Specifically, the function `func_5` is incorrectly implemented. Instead of computing the GCD of `r` and `b`, it always returns 0, which means the function will never return 1 unless `a` and `b` are both 0, which is not relevant to the problem.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:
For the input `l = 1` and `r = 4`, the code should find a counterexample, but instead, it incorrectly returns `-1` because `func_5(r, b)` always returns 0.

To fix this, the function `func_5` should correctly compute the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. Here is a corrected version of `func_5`:

```python
def func_5(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

With this correction, the code should be able to find the required counterexample.
