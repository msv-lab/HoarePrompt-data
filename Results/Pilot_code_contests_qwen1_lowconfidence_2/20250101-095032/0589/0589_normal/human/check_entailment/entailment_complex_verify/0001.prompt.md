You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three. 
Program:

from atexit import register
from io import BytesIO
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(input())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

#Function 3:

    s = input()

            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return (a, b, r)
    return (-1, -1, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not correctly identify a valid triplet (a, b, c) that meets the criteria. 

The function `func_6` iterates through possible values of `a` and `b` within the given range `[l, r]`. However, it checks if `(r, b)` and `(b, a)` are coprime, but it should be checking if `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` are coprime, and then check if `(a, c)` is not coprime. Additionally, the function should ensure that `c` is chosen in such a way that `(a, c)` is not coprime.

Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input `900000000000000009 900000000000000029`, the expected output is `900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021`, but the program will return `(-1, -1, -1)` because it incorrectly checks `(r, b)` and `(b, a)` instead of `(a, b)` and `(b, c)`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly iterate through possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and check the conditions properly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import os
import sys
from atexit import register
from io import BytesIO

sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))
sys.stdout = BytesIO()
register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
(l, r) = func_2()
if func_5(r, l) == 1:
    (a, b, c) = func_6(l, r)
    if a == -1:
        sys.stdout.write('-1\n')
    sys.stdout.write(str(a) + ' ' + str(b) + ' ' + str(c) + '\n')
else:
    sys.stdout.write(str(l) + ' ' + str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(r) + '\n')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input within the range [l, r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and ensures that the input falls within the range [l, r]. If the input is within the specified range, it returns the integer input; otherwise, it may result in undefined behavior since no validation or error handling is performed for out-of-range inputs. The function does not perform any other operations and only returns the validated integer input. Potential edge cases include the user inputting a value outside the range [l, r], in which case the behavior is unspecified.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers generated by mapping int function over input split by spaces, where the input is provided by user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converting each integer to a list of integers. The function returns this list of integers. The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle cases where the input might be empty or contain non-integer values.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing a sequence of digits such that the length of the string is at least 3 and the substring of the first three characters can form three distinct integers l, b, and c where l ≤ b < c ≤ r.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
    #The program returns a list containing each character of the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `s` consisting of digits as input and returns a list containing each character of the string `s`. There are no specific conditions on the length of the string or its content beyond it being a string of digits. The function does not perform any additional checks or operations on the input string.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object created from converting the split input integers to int, but the specific values cannot be determined without input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers from standard input, splits them based on whitespace, converts each integer to a type `int`, and returns a map object containing these integers. The specific values of the integers cannot be determined without user input. There are no explicit edge cases handled within the function itself; thus, it relies on the input being valid integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is formatted incorrectly, a `ValueError` would be raised during the conversion process, which is not caught or handled within this function.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b, and a and b are within the range [l, r] where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        
        a = b
        
        b = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is 0
    return b
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b` and both are within the range [l, r] with 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At the end of the loop, the value of `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, due to the return statement immediately following the loop, the function always returns 0, regardless of the computed GCD. This means the function effectively ignores the result of the GCD computation and always returns 0.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l <= r and r - l <= 50. a and b are integers within the range [l, r] where a < b, and the function func_5 returns an integer indicating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its two arguments.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a`, `b`, and `r` are such that if the function returns, `a`, `b`, and `r` satisfy `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If the function does not return, `a` and `b` are undefined, and `r` remains the same as the input value.
    return -1, -1, -1
    #The program returns (-1, -1, -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, where both are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). It searches for integers `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a < b` and meets specific conditions related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculated by the function `func_5`. The function returns one of the following states based on the conditions met:

1. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `func_5(r, b) == 1`, and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
2. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + 1`, and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
3. A tuple `(a, b, r)` where `a` is less than `r`, `b` is `a + k + 1` (where `k` is the number of iterations completed), and the conditions \(1 \leq l \leq r\) and \(r - l \leq 50\) are satisfied.
4. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1`.
5. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 1`.
6. A tuple `(-1, -1, -1)` when no valid `a` and `b` are found within the specified conditions, and `a` is `r + 1` and `b` is `a + 3`.
7. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, l) != 1`.
8. A tuple `(l, b, r)` where `b` is the maximum integer within the range `[l, r]` that satisfies `func_5(r, b - 1) != 1` or `func_5(b - 1, l) == 1`.
9. A tuple `(l, l + 2, r)` when no other conditions are met.

The function ensures that the returned values of `a` and `b` meet the specified GCD conditions and lie within the given range `[l, r]`, with the additional constraints on the difference between `r` and `l`.
