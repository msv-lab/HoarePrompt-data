You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three.

    return (-1, -1, -1)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a counterexample for the given statement but does not correctly implement the logic to check for coprimality or ensure the conditions are met. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not properly check if the pair `(a, c)` is not coprime after finding pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` that are coprime.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Coprimality Check**: The function `func_5` is a valid implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the main issue lies in how this function is used within `func_6`.

2. **Logic Flaw in `func_6`**:
   - The function `func_6` iterates through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the GCD of `r` and `b` is 1 (i.e., they are coprime).
   - It also checks if the GCD of `b` and `a` is not 1 (i.e., they are not coprime).
   - This logic assumes that if `(b, r)` is coprime and `(b, a)` is not coprime, then `(a, r)` will not be coprime. This is incorrect because it doesn't guarantee that `(a, c)` will fail the coprimality check.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `l = 1` and `r = 4`. The function might return `(1, 2, 4)` because:
     - `(2, 4)` are not coprime (GCD is 2).
     - `(1, 2)` are coprime (GCD is 1).
   - However, `(1, 4)` are coprime (GCD is 1), which violates the requirement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
