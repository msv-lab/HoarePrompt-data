Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_6` does not correctly implement the logic required to find a counterexample for the given problem. Specifically, the function checks if `(r, b)` and `(b, a)` are coprime, but it should be checking if `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` are coprime, and then check if `(a, c)` is not coprime. Additionally, the function should ensure that `c` is chosen in such a way that `(a, c)` is not coprime. The current implementation does not meet these requirements and thus does not correctly find the counterexample as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the given problem.
