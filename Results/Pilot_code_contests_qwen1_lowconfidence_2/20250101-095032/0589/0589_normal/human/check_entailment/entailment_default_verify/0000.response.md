Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_6` does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for the given statement. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the pair `(a, c)` is not coprime while the pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` are coprime. The output hints provide several scenarios where the function returns invalid results, such as returning tuples where the conditions are not met or returning `-1` when valid counterexamples should exist. These issues indicate that the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description accurately.
