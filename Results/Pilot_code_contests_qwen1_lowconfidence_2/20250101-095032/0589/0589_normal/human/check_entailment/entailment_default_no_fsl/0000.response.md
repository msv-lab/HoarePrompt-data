Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code contains a logical error in the `func_5` function. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) but immediately returns 0 at the end of the loop, regardless of the actual GCD value. This means that `func_5` always returns 0, which leads to incorrect results in the rest of the program.

For example, consider the input range `l = 1` and `r = 10`. The code will always return -1 because `func_5(r, b)` and `func_5(b, a)` will both return 0, which does not help in finding the required counterexample.

To fix this, the `func_5` function should correctly return the GCD value instead of 0. Here is the corrected version of the `func_5` function:

```python
def func_5(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

With this correction, the program should be able to find the required counterexample if it exists.
