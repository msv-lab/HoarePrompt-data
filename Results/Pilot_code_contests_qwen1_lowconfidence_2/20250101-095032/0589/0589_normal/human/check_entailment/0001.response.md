Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not correctly identify a valid triplet (a, b, c) that meets the criteria. 

The function `func_6` iterates through possible values of `a` and `b` within the given range `[l, r]`. However, it checks if `(r, b)` and `(b, a)` are coprime, but it should be checking if `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` are coprime, and then check if `(a, c)` is not coprime. Additionally, the function should ensure that `c` is chosen in such a way that `(a, c)` is not coprime.

Here is an example where the program fails:

For the input `900000000000000009 900000000000000029`, the expected output is `900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021`, but the program will return `(-1, -1, -1)` because it incorrectly checks `(r, b)` and `(b, a)` instead of `(a, b)` and `(b, c)`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly iterate through possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and check the conditions properly.
