Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a counterexample for the given statement but does not correctly implement the logic to check for coprimality or ensure the conditions are met. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not properly check if the pair `(a, c)` is not coprime after finding pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` that are coprime.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Coprimality Check**: The function `func_5` is a valid implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the main issue lies in how this function is used within `func_6`.

2. **Logic Flaw in `func_6`**:
   - The function `func_6` iterates through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the GCD of `r` and `b` is 1 (i.e., they are coprime).
   - It also checks if the GCD of `b` and `a` is not 1 (i.e., they are not coprime).
   - This logic assumes that if `(b, r)` is coprime and `(b, a)` is not coprime, then `(a, r)` will not be coprime. This is incorrect because it doesn't guarantee that `(a, c)` will fail the coprimality check.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `l = 1` and `r = 4`. The function might return `(1, 2, 4)` because:
     - `(2, 4)` are not coprime (GCD is 2).
     - `(1, 2)` are coprime (GCD is 1).
   - However, `(1, 4)` are coprime (GCD is 1), which violates the requirement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample, hence the correctness is **False**.
