Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the following issues are identified:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are defined but not used correctly in the main logic of the program. The function definitions do not align with the problem description or the expected behavior of the program.
   - The primary logic should involve finding three distinct numbers \( (a, b, c) \) such that \( l \leq a < b < c \leq r \), and the pairs \( (a, b) \) and \( (b, c) \) are coprime, while \( (a, c) \) is not coprime.
   - The functions `func_5` and `func_6` are not necessary for the current logic, and their implementations are incorrect for the purpose of solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is defined in the conditional block starting with `if func_5(r, l) == 1:`. However, this logic is flawed because:
     - `func_5(r, l)` is not used correctly. The function should be checking the GCD of \( b \) and \( c \) to ensure they are coprime, not \( r \) and \( l \).
     - The function `func_5` incorrectly computes the GCD using a loop that does not return the expected result. It should use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD, but instead, it sets all variables to zero and returns zero.

3. **Finding the Counterexample**:
   - The logic to find the counterexample is implemented in `func_6`. However, the logic is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described:
     - The function `func_6` should iterate over possible values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) and check the conditions for coprimality.
     - The current implementation does not correctly handle the conditions for coprimality and non-coprimality.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The output handling is somewhat correct, but the main logic for finding the counterexample is flawed.

To correct the program, the main logic should focus on iterating over possible values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) within the given range, checking the coprimality conditions, and ensuring that the conditions are met. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def find_counterexample(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r):
        for b in range(a + 1, r):
            if gcd(a, b) == 1:
                for c in range(b + 1, r + 1):
                    if gcd(b, c) == 1 and gcd(a, c) != 1:
                        return a, b, c
    return -1, -1, -1

l, r = map(int, input().split())
a, b, c = find_counterexample(l, r)
if a == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(a, b, c)
```

This corrected version uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD and iterates over possible values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to find a counterexample.
