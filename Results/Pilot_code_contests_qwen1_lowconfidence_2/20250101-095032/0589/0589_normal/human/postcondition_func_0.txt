The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and ensures that the input falls within the range [l, r]. If the input is within the specified range, it returns the integer input; otherwise, it may result in undefined behavior since no validation or error handling is performed for out-of-range inputs. The function does not perform any other operations and only returns the validated integer input. Potential edge cases include the user inputting a value outside the range [l, r], in which case the behavior is unspecified.
