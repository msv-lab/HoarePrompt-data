The function `func_1` accepts a string `word` consisting only of lowercase English letters and returns a dictionary `table`. This dictionary contains each character from `word` as keys and their respective counts as values. The function iterates through each character in `word`, updating the count of each character in the `table` dictionary. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. Potential edge cases to consider include an empty string input, where the `table` would be an empty dictionary, and the maximum length constraint of 100,000 characters for `word`, although this is not explicitly handled within the function itself.
