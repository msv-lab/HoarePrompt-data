The code creates a default dictionary named `table` with integer values. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `word`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`word` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and `table` is a defaultdict(int)**
