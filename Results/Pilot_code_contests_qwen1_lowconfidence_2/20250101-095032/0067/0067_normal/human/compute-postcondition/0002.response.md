The code snippet `table[char] += 1` increments the count of the character `char` in the dictionary `table`. However, the variable `char` is not defined in the provided initial state, and there is no definition or assignment for `char` within the given code snippet. Therefore, the impact of this line of code cannot be fully determined without knowing the value of `char`.

Since the initial state does not include `char`, and there is no way to infer its value from the given context, the output state remains unchanged regarding the value of `char`.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters**
