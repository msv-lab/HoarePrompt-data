`table[char]` is incremented by 1, where `char` is the last character of the string `word`. The initial state is that `word` is a non-empty string consisting of at least one lowercase English letter, and `table[char]` is incremented by 1 for the new last character in the updated `word`. After executing the code, the value of `table[char]` is increased by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of at least one lowercase English letter; `table[char]` is incremented by 1, where `char` is the last character of `word`.**
