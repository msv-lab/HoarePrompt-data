Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `word` is a non-empty string consisting of at least two lowercase English letters.
   - `table[char]` is incremented by 1 for each character `char` in `word`.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `word`.
   - After the loop body (which we are not given but can assume it increments `table[char]`), the loop moves to the next character.

3. **Current Iteration Analysis**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through each character in `word`, at the end of the last iteration, the last character of `word` would have been processed.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `word` needs to be considered.

4. **Modifying the State**:
   - Since `word` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, the loop will continue as long as there are characters left to process.
   - After processing the last character, the next character will be the first character of the remaining substring.
   - Hence, `word` will now be reduced by one character from its original length.

5. **Updating the States**:
   - `word` will be the substring of itself excluding the last character.
   - `table[char]` will be incremented by 1 for the new last character in the updated `word`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `word` will be the substring of itself excluding the last character.
- `table[char]` will be incremented by 1 for the new last character in the updated `word`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
**`word` is a non-empty string consisting of at least one lowercase English letter, `table[char]` is incremented by 1 for the new last character in the updated `word`**.

To provide a concrete example, if the original `word` was "hello" and it had gone through iterations for "hello", "hell", "hel", "he", "h", then at the start of the next iteration (if `word` still has characters), `word` would be "he" and `table` would be incremented by 1 for 'e'.

So, the final state is:
State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of at least one lowercase English letter, `table[char]` is incremented by 1 for the new last character in the updated `word`**.
