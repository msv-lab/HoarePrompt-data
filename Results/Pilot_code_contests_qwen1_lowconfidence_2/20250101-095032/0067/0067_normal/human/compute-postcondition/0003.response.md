State at the end of the previous iteration: `word` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters.

To determine the state needed at the start of the next iteration of the loop:

1. **Understand the Loop**: The loop iterates over each character (`char`) in the string `word`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `word` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters. This means `word` still exists and contains characters.
3. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more character in `word` to iterate over.

Since `word` is a non-empty string, it will have at least one character. After the first iteration, `word` loses one character. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `word` must have at least two characters (one for the current iteration and one for the next).

State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of at least two lowercase English letters**
