The code `table[char] += 1` increments the count of the character `char` in the dictionary `table`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `char`. Therefore, the only change is that the count of the character `char` in the dictionary `table` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of at least two lowercase English letters; `table[char]` is incremented by 1**
