Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The goal is to construct a string \( k \) by swapping letters in string \( a \) such that \( k \) contains as many non-overlapping substrings equal to either \( b \) or \( c \) as possible.
   - The program needs to maximize the number of non-overlapping occurrences of \( b \) and \( c \) in the resulting string \( k \).

2. **Current Program Behavior**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each character in strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) using the `func_1` function.
   - It determines the maximum number of times \( b \) can appear in \( k \) (`maxb`) by dividing the frequency of each character in \( a \) by the corresponding frequency in \( b \).
   - Then, it attempts to calculate how many times \( c \) can appear in the remaining positions, but the logic is flawed.

3. **Flaws in the Current Program**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the number of times \( c \) can appear by subtracting the frequency of \( b \) multiplied by its count from the total frequency of each character in \( a \) and then dividing by the frequency of \( c \). This approach does not account for the optimal placement of \( c \) and \( b \) to maximize non-overlapping occurrences.
   - The program then constructs the output string \( k \) by first writing as many \( b \)'s as possible, followed by as many \( c \)'s as possible, and finally filling the remaining positions with the leftover characters from \( a \). However, this method does not ensure the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings of \( b \) and \( c \).

4. **Example to Illustrate the Issue**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     aaa
     a
     b
     ```
   - The correct output should be `aaa` since placing `b` in `aaa` results in one non-overlapping substring of `a` (which matches `b`), and no overlapping substrings of `c` can be added without violating the non-overlapping constraint.
   - However, the current program might output something like `aab` or another invalid configuration, which does not maximize the number of non-overlapping substrings.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of non-overlapping substrings of \( b \) and \( c \) in the string \( k \). Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description requirements.
