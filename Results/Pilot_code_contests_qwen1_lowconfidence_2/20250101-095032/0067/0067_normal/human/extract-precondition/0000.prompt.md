You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.

GukiZ has strings a, b, and c. He wants to obtain string k by swapping some letters in a, so that k should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to b or c as possible. Substring of string x is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from x. Two substrings of string x overlap if there is position i in string x occupied by both of them.

GukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings k?

Input

The first line contains string a, the second line contains string b, and the third line contains string c (1 ≤ |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 105, where |s| denotes the length of string s).

All three strings consist only of lowercase English letters. 

It is possible that b and c coincide.

Output

Find one of possible strings k, as described in the problem statement. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

aaa
a
b


Output

aaa

Input

Output

nisteaadddiiklooprrvz

Input

abbbaaccca
ab
aca


Output

ababacabcc

Note

In the third sample, this optimal solutions has three non-overlaping substrings equal to either b or c on positions 1 – 2 (ab), 3 – 4 (ab), 5 – 7 (aca). In this sample, there exist many other optimal solutions, one of them would be acaababbcc.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(word):
```
