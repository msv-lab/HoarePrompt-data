#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a string consisting only of lowercase English letters, and there are two additional strings b and c also consisting only of lowercase English letters. The lengths of all three strings do not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(word):
    table = defaultdict(int)
    for char in word:
        table[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `word` is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters, `table[char]` is the count of each character in `word`.
    return table
    #`table` which is a dictionary containing each character from `word` as keys and their respective counts as values
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `word` consisting only of lowercase English letters and returns a dictionary `table`. This dictionary contains each character from `word` as keys and their respective counts as values. The function iterates through each character in `word`, updating the count of each character in the `table` dictionary. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. Potential edge cases to consider include an empty string input, where the `table` would be an empty dictionary, and the maximum length constraint of 100,000 characters for `word`, although this is not explicitly handled within the function itself.
