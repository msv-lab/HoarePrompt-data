The line `win = True` sets the variable `win` to `True`. The initial conditions are as follows:
- `i` is 1 + 4 * `slice_len`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'
- `win` is initially `True` if `field[4 * slice_len]` is '*', or if `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `win` is `False`
- `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`

Since `win` is explicitly set to `True`, the new value of `win` is `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, `field`, and `slice_len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1 + 4 * `slice_len`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True`, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`**
