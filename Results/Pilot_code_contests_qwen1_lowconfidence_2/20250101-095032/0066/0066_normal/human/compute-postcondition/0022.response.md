Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial Conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration:
     - `i` is \(1 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}\)
     - `n` is greater than 0
     - `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '` (dots and stars)
     - `win` is `True` if `i + \text{slice\_len}` is greater than or equal to `n` or `field[i + \text{slice\_len}]` is `'*'`, otherwise `i`, `n`, `field`, and `win` retain their original states.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the New State After the Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes \(i + 1 = (1 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}) + 1 = 2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}\).

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - Hence, \(2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} < n\).

5. **Determine the New Values of `win` and Other Variables:**
   - Since the problem does not specify what happens inside the loop body, we assume that `win`, `n`, and `field` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.
   - `win` remains `True` if \(2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}]` is `'*'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is \(2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}\), `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '`, `win` is `True` if \(2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}]` is `'*'`**.
