The code `field = raw_input()` assigns the input received from the user to the variable `field`. Since the initial state specifies that `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', the new value of `field` will be the string input by the user, which should also be of length `n` and consist of characters '*' and '.'. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `field` is updated to the input string**
