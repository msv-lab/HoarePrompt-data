Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'
   - `win` is `True` if `field[4 * slice_len]` is '*' or if `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `win` remains `False`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can continue as long as it does not exceed `n`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `field` remains unchanged.
   - `win` will be re-evaluated based on the new value of `i`.

6. **Win Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - `win` will be checked again based on the new value of `i` (which is now 1).
   - Specifically, `win` will be `True` if `field[4 * slice_len]` is '*', or if `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True` if `field[4 * slice_len]` is '*' or if `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `win` remains `False`**.
