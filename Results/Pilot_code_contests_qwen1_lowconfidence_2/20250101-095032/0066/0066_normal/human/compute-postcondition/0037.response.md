Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes an integer `n` and a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, representing a level scheme where `'*'` is a platform and `'.'` is a pit. It iterates through each character in `field` and checks if there is a platform (`'*'`) followed by a sequence of pits and platforms (of length `4 * slice_len`) that ends with another platform. If such a sequence is found, it sets `win` to `True`. After the loop, the function prints `'yes'` if `win` is `True`, indicating that a win condition was met, otherwise it prints `'no'`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `field`, and `win`. If `win` is `True`, it means there is a path from a platform to another platform via a sequence of pits and platforms that can be traversed without falling into a pit. If `win` is `False`, no such path exists.**

Potential Edge Cases:
1. If `field` consists entirely of `'.'` (all pits), the function will always print `'no'` since there are no platforms.
2. If `field` has only one platform (either at the start, end, or in the middle), the function will check if there is a valid path from this platform to another platform. If such a path exists, it will print `'yes'`; otherwise, it will print `'no'`.
3. If `field` starts or ends with a platform, the function will still check for a valid path within the constraints. If the last possible segment does not satisfy the conditions, `win` will remain `False`.

Missing Functionality:
The annotation mentions `slice_len` being returned by `func_1(field, i)`, but the code does not actually use the return value of `func_1`. Therefore, the code assumes `func_1` always returns a non-zero value, which might not be the case. This could lead to incorrect results if `func_1` sometimes returns zero, causing `j + slice_len` to go out of bounds or violate the condition `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`.
