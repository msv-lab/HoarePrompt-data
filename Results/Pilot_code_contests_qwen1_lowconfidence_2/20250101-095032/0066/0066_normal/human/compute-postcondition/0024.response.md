Let's go through this step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `i` is calculated as `2 + 4 * slice_len` returned by `func_1(field, i)`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '` 
   - `win` is `True` if `2 + 4 * slice_len >= n` or `field[2 + 4 * slice_len] == '*'`

2. Code Execution:
   - `j = i + 4 * slice_len`
     - This line simply updates the value of `j` to be the sum of `i` and `4 * slice_len`.
     - Since `i` was already calculated as `2 + 4 * slice_len`, substituting `i` in the equation gives `j = (2 + 4 * slice_len) + 4 * slice_len = 2 + 8 * slice_len`.

3. After the code execution, the following changes occur:
   - `j` is updated to `2 + 8 * slice_len`
   - The values of `i`, `n`, `field`, and `win` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`, `j` is `2 + 8 * slice_len`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '`, `win` is `True` if `2 + 4 * slice_len >= n` or `field[2 + 4 * slice_len] == '*'`**
