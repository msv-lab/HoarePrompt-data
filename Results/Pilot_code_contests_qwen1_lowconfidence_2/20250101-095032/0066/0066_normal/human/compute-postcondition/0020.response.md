Postcondition: ***`i` is 1 + 4 * `slice_len`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True` because either `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n` or `field[i + slice_len]` is '*', where `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`. If the if condition is not met, `i`, `n`, `field`, and `win` retain their original states.***
