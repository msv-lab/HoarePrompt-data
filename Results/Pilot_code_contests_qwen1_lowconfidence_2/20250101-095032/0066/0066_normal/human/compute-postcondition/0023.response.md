`slice_len` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact value. The initial value of `i` is \(2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}\). Since `slice_len` now holds the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, the value of `i` will be updated to \(2 + 4 \times \text{value of slice\_len}\). The states of the other variables (`n`, `field`, and `win`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is \(2 + 4 \times \text{value of slice\_len}\) returned by `func_1(field, i)`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '`, `win` is `True` if \(2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}]` is `'*'`**
