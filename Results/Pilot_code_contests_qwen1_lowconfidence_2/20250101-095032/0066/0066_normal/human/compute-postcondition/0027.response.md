Postcondition: ***`i` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`, `j` is `2 + 8 * slice_len`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '` and `win` is `True` if either `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`. If both conditions are false, `win` remains unchanged.***
