The function `func_1(field, i)` is called with `field` and `i` as arguments. However, the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided. Since `field[i]` is not '.', the function `func_1` will slice the field starting from index `i` until it encounters a '.'. Let's denote the length of this slice as `slice_len`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'
- `win` is `False`
- The current value of `field[i]` is not '.'

After executing the line `slice_len = func_1(field, i)`, `slice_len` will hold the length of the slice from `field[i]` to the first occurrence of '.' in `field`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len` without knowing the content of `field`. However, we know that `slice_len` is the length of the substring from `field[0]` to the first '.'.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `False`, `slice_len` is the length of the substring from `field[0]` to the first '.'**
