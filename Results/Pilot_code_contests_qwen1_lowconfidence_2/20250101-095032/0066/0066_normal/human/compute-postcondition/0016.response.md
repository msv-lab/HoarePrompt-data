Output State: **`i` is 1 + 4 * `slice_len`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True` if `field[4 * slice_len]` is '*' or if `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `win` is `False`, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`**
