The code `j = i + 4 * slice_len` updates the value of `j` based on the value of `i` and `slice_len`. However, the value of `slice_len` is not defined in the initial state. Since `slice_len` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `j`. But we know that `j` is calculated as `i + 4 * slice_len`.

Given that `i` is 0 in the initial state, the calculation simplifies to `j = 0 + 4 * slice_len`, which means `j` is `4 * slice_len`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `field`, and `win`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4 * slice_len, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `False`.**
