The code snippet prints 'yes'. This does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True` if there exists any index `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) such that `field[i]` is not '.', `slice_len` returned by `func_1(field, i)` satisfies `j + slice_len < n` and `field[j + slice_len]` is '*', `win` is `True` since the win condition is met in the if statement, and the program prints 'yes'**.
