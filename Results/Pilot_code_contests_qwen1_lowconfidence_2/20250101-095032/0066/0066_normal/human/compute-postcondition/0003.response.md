State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'; `win` is `False`.

Now, let's think step by step about which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

1. The loop will iterate over the range defined by `n`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration. The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue as long as `i < n`.

3. The initial value of `field` is already given as a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', which is consistent with the requirement for the loop to execute.

4. The variable `win` is given as `False`, and its value does not directly affect the loop's execution but may be modified within the loop body.

Based on these considerations, we need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `i` to 0 (which is the initial value) and ensuring `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `False`**
