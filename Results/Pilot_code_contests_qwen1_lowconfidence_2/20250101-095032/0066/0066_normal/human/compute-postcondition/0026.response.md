The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no such structure in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is `2 + 4 * slice_len`, `j` is `2 + 8 * slice_len`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '`, `win` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
