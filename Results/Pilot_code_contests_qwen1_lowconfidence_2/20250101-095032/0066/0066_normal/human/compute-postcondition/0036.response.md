The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. However, from the context provided, it seems the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `field`. 

- `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`.
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, where `'*'` represents a platform and `'.'` represents a pit.

Based on the provided output cases, the function does not explicitly return anything, but we need to infer the return value from the description.

Case_1: The function checks if `field` has any platforms (`'*'`). If there are no platforms, the function returns `False`.
Case_2: If there are platforms in `field`, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, and return `True` if there is at least one platform in `field`, otherwise return `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, and returns `True` if there is at least one platform in `field`, otherwise returns `False`.**
