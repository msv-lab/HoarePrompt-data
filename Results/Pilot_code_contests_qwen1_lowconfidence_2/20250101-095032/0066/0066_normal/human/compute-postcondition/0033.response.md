Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `False`, `slice_len` returned by `func_1(field, i)` either does not satisfy `j + slice_len < n` or `field[j + slice_len]` is not '*', for all valid indices `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`), and `field` remains a string of the same length and composition**
