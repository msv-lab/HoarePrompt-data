Postcondition: ***`i` is `2 + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}`, `j` is `2 + 8 \times \text{slice\_len}`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'. '`, and `win` is `True` if either `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`. If both conditions are false, `win` remains unchanged.***
