The variable `win` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The initial values of `n` and `field` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `win` and retains the initial values of `n` and `field`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'; `win` is `False`**
