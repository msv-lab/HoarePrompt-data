`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The length of the string `field` is originally `n`, and it consists of characters '*' and '.'. After running this line of code, the length of `field` remains `n`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'**
