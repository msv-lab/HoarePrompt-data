The function `func_1(field, i)` is called, which impacts the value of `slice_len`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len`. However, we know the following:

- `i` is initially 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'.
- `win` is `True` if `field[4 * slice_len]` is '*' or if `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `win` remains `False`.

After executing `slice_len = func_1(field, i)`, the value of `slice_len` is determined by the function `func_1`, but its exact value is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True` if `field[4 * slice_len]` is '*' or if `i + slice_len` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `win` remains `False`, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`**
