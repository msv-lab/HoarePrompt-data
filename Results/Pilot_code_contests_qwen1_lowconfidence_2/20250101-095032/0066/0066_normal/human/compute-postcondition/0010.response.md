The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 4 * `slice_len`; `n` must be greater than 0; `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.'; `win` is `True`.**
