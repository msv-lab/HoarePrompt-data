The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, since it is placed outside of any loop or conditional block, it will simply cause the program to exit the current block it is in. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `field`, `win`, and `slice_len` are not changed by the `break` statement. 

Output State: **`i` is 1 + 4 * `slice_len`, `n` is greater than 0, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True`, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
