Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '*' and '.', `win` is `True` if there exists any index `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) such that `field[i]` is not '.', `slice_len` returned by `func_1(field, i)` satisfies `j + slice_len < n` and `field[j + slice_len]` is '*', otherwise `win` remains `False`.**
