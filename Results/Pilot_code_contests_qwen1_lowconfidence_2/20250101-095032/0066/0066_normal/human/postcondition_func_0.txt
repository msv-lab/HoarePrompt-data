The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `field`, which is a string consisting of '*' and '.', and `i`, which is an integer such that `0 <= i < len(field)`. The function iterates over possible step sizes (`slice_len`) from 1 to the length of `field`. For each step size, it extracts a substring `res` from `field` starting at index `i` with the given step size. The function checks if the length of `res` is exactly 5 and if it consists solely of asterisks ('*'). If such a substring is found, the function returns the corresponding step size `slice_len`. If no such substring exists, the function returns 0.
