Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code accurately implements the logic required to determine if a level is "good" based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of segments `n` and the scheme of the level as a string `field`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function searches for a sequence of 5 platforms with equal distances between them. It iterates through possible step sizes (`slice_len`) and checks if the substring starting at `i` with the given step size has exactly 5 platforms. If such a sequence is found, it returns the step size; otherwise, it returns 0.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function iterates through each position in the level and uses `func_1` to check if there is a sequence of 5 platforms starting from that position. If such a sequence is found, it sets `win` to `True` and breaks out of the loop. After checking all positions, it prints 'yes' if `win` is `True`, indicating that a valid sequence of 4 jumps is possible, and 'no' otherwise.

The code handles all the described scenarios and follows the problem description correctly. There are no cases where the provided code fails to meet the requirements based on the problem description and the given examples.
