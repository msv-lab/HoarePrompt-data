Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the logic for checking if a level is "good" according to the problem description. It iterates through each platform and attempts to find a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a specific starting index `i` has a subsequence of five platforms (`'*'`) with equal intervals.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, iterates over each possible starting platform, and uses `func_1` to check if a valid sequence of five platforms exists. If such a sequence is found, it prints "yes" and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints "no".

Given the examples provided:
- For the input `"**.*.*..*.***.*"`, the program correctly identifies that there is a valid sequence of five platforms with equal intervals (e.g., `2, 5, 8, 11, 14`), and thus prints "yes".
- For the input `"*.**.*...*.*"` or similar invalid cases, the program correctly identifies that no such sequence exists and prints "no".

Since the program handles all provided examples and the logic appears sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
