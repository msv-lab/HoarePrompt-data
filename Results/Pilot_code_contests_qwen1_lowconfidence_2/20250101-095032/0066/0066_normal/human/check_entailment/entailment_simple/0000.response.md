Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of segments (`n`) and the scheme of the level (`field`) as per the problem description.
   - It checks the validity of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and ensures `field` is a string of the correct length containing only `'.'` and `'*'`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function iterates over possible jump lengths (`slice_len`) to find a sequence of 5 consecutive platforms.
   - It returns the jump length if such a sequence is found; otherwise, it returns 0.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is consistent with the problem's requirement to find a sequence of 4 equal-length jumps leading to a fifth platform.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - For each starting platform in the level, it calls `func_1` to determine if a sequence of 4 equal-length jumps to a 5th platform exists.
   - If such a sequence is found, it checks if the next jump also lands on a platform.
   - If a valid sequence of 5 platforms is found, it sets `win` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `'yes'` if a valid sequence of 5 platforms is found.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'no'`.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    16
    .**.*..*.***.**
    ```
  - `func_2` iterates over each position in the level.
  - At position 1, `func_1` finds a sequence of 5 platforms with a jump length of 3 (`1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13`).
  - `func_2` then checks the next jump (position 13 + 3 = 16) and finds it is a platform.
  - Hence, it prints `'yes'`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input:
    ```
    11
    .*.*...*.*
    ```
  - No valid sequence of 5 platforms is found, so the program prints `'no'`.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required to determine if a level is "good" based on the presence of a sequence of 5 platforms with equal-length jumps between them. Therefore, the program meets the problem description in all cases.
