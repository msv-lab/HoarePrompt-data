Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly identify levels as "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks for a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them, but it does not account for the possibility of such a sequence existing within the level. The program only checks if there is a sequence of four jumps (five positions) starting from each platform and does not ensure that such a sequence of five platforms exists in the entire level.

For example, consider the following level:
```
field = ".*.*...*.*."
```
This level does not contain a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals, but the program will incorrectly identify it as "yes" because it finds sequences of four jumps starting from certain positions. For instance, starting from the second position, the sequence would be `2, 5, 8, 11, 14`, but since the length of the field is only 11, this sequence is not valid. Therefore, the program should not return "yes" for this level.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that there exists a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals. This can be done by checking all possible starting points and intervals to see if there is a valid sequence of five platforms.
