Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a level is "good." Specifically, the program checks for a sequence of five platforms with equal spacing but fails to ensure that the entire sequence is valid within the bounds of the level. 

For example, consider the input:
```
16
.**.*..*.***.**
```

The program correctly identifies that there is a sequence of five platforms (2, 5, 8, 11, 14) with a jump length of 3. However, the program incorrectly prints "no" because it does not validate the last platform (index 14) properly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the sequence of five platforms is fully contained within the level. Here is a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    win = False
    for i in range(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            for jump_length in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
                if (i + 4 * jump_length) < n and field[i + 4 * jump_length] == '*' and all(field[i + k * jump_length] == '*' for k in range(1, 4)):
                    win = True
                    break
            if win:
                break
    if win:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

This corrected version ensures that the sequence of five platforms is fully contained within the level and handles all potential cases correctly.
