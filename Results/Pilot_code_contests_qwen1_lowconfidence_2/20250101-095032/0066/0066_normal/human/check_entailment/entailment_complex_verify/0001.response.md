Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic for checking if a level is "good". The program iterates through each platform and attempts to find a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them. The annotations provided explain the state of the program at different points and confirm that the logic implemented in both functions `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements.

- **Function `func_1`**: Checks if there is a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals starting from a given index `i`.
- **Function `func_2`**: Iterates through each platform in the level, uses `func_1` to check for the required sequence, and determines if the level is "good".

The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. The program correctly identifies the presence or absence of a valid sequence of five platforms with equal intervals, printing "yes" or "no" accordingly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
