Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a level is "good" according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if there is a sequence of five platforms (represented by `'*'`) with equal spacing.
   - It iterates over possible step sizes and checks if a substring of length 5 starting from index `i` consists only of asterisks.
   - If such a sequence is found, it returns the step size, otherwise, it returns 0.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of segments `n` and the level scheme `field`.
   - It iterates through each position in the level scheme.
   - For each non-pit position (`field[i] != '.'`), it uses `func_1` to find a possible step size for a sequence of five platforms.
   - If a valid step size is found, it checks if there is another platform at the end of the sequence (`j + slice_len < n and field[j + slice_len] == '*'`).
   - If such a sequence is found, it sets `win` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints "yes" if `win` is `True`, otherwise it prints "no".

The code handles all cases correctly:
- It correctly identifies sequences of five platforms with equal spacing.
- It ensures that the sequence starts and ends with platforms.
- It checks all possible starting points for such sequences.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the code works as expected for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
