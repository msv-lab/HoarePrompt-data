Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to check if a level is "good" by iterating through each platform and using `func_1` to find a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them. The output hints further confirm this understanding. Both the examples provided and the described functionality of the functions align with the problem requirements. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
