You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.

In a new ZeptoLab game called "King of Thieves" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way.

<image>

An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.

A dungeon consists of n segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. 

One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number i1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms i1 < i2 < ... < ik, if i2 - i1 = i3 - i2 = ... = ik - ik - 1. Of course, all segments i1, i2, ... ik should be exactly the platforms, not pits. 

Let's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence i1, i2, ..., i5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of segments on the level.

Next line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of n characters '*' and '.'.

Output

If the level is good, print the word "yes" (without the quotes), otherwise print the word "no" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

16
.**.*..*.***.**.


Output

yes

Input

11
.*.*...*.*.


Output

no

Note

In the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function
#Function 1:
def func_1(field, i):
    for slice_len in xrange(1, len(field) + 1):
        res = field[i::slice_len]
        if len(res) == 5 and set(res) == {'*'}:
            return slice_len
    return 0

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    n = int(raw_input())
    field = raw_input()
    win = False
    for i in xrange(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            slice_len = func_1(field, i)
            if slice_len:
                j = i + 4 * slice_len
                if j + slice_len >= n or field[j + slice_len] == '*':
                    win = True
                    break
    if win:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the logic for checking if a level is "good" according to the problem description. It iterates through each platform and attempts to find a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a specific starting index `i` has a subsequence of five platforms (`'*'`) with equal intervals.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, iterates over each possible starting platform, and uses `func_1` to check if a valid sequence of five platforms exists. If such a sequence is found, it prints "yes" and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints "no".

Given the examples provided:
- For the input `"**.*.*..*.***.*"`, the program correctly identifies that there is a valid sequence of five platforms with equal intervals (e.g., `2, 5, 8, 11, 14`), and thus prints "yes".
- For the input `"*.**.*...*.*"` or similar invalid cases, the program correctly identifies that no such sequence exists and prints "no".

Since the program handles all provided examples and the logic appears sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes an integer `n` and a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, representing a level scheme where `'*'` is a platform and `'.'` is a pit. It iterates through each character in `field` and checks if there is a platform (`'*'`) followed by a sequence of pits and platforms (of length `4 * slice_len`) that ends with another platform. If such a sequence is found, it sets `win` to `True`. After the loop, the function prints `'yes'` if `win` is `True`, indicating that a win condition was met, otherwise it prints `'no'`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `field`, and `win`. If `win` is `True`, it means there is a path from a platform to another platform via a sequence of pits and platforms that can be traversed without falling into a pit. If `win` is `False`, no such path exists.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
