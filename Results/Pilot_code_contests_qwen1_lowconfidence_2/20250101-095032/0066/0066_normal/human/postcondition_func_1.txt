The function `func_2` takes an integer `n` and a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'.'`, representing a level scheme where `'*'` is a platform and `'.'` is a pit. It iterates through each character in `field` and checks if there is a platform (`'*'`) followed by a sequence of pits and platforms (of length `4 * slice_len`) that ends with another platform. If such a sequence is found, it sets `win` to `True`. After the loop, the function prints `'yes'` if `win` is `True`, indicating that a win condition was met, otherwise it prints `'no'`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `field`, and `win`. If `win` is `True`, it means there is a path from a platform to another platform via a sequence of pits and platforms that can be traversed without falling into a pit. If `win` is `False`, no such path exists.
