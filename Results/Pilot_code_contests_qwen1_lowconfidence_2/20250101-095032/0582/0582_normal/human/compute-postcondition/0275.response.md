The code `ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]` assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. According to the initial state, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is an empty list. After this assignment, `ans[x][j]` will take the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which means it will no longer be an empty list but will have the same value as `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

The other conditions and variables remain unchanged:
- `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`.
- `ans[x][j]` is updated to the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
