The code `ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]` updates the value of `ans[x][j]` to be the same as `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that the value of `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is the same list as at the end of the previous iteration, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the updated value if `j` was not in `ans[x]` or `ans[fa[x]]` was empty**
