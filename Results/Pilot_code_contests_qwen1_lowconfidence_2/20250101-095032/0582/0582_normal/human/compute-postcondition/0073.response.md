Postcondition: **`count` is an integer, `ans` is a list where for every index `i`, `ans[i]` is a non-empty string, and `len(ans[x]) >= len(ans[fa[x]])` still holds. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is set to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]` and `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is not longer than `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` equals `ans[fa[x]][j]`**.
