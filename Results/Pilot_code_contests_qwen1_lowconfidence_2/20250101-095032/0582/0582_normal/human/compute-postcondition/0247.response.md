The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list stored at `ans[x][j]`. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is to the content of `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` must be the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `j` must be the next element in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list (cleared).**
