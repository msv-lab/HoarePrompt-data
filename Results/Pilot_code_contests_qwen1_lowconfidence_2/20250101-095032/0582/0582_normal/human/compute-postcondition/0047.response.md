Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists, and `j` is the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes equal to `ans[x][j]`.***
