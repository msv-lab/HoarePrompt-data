The code `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` performs a bitwise OR operation between the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. This operation updates the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to be the result of this bitwise OR operation.

Based on the initial state:
- `ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary that must have at least one key.
- `ans[x]` is a dictionary.
- `j` is a key in `ans[fa[x]]`.

Let's denote the initial value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` as `val1` and the initial value of `ans[x][j]` as `val2`. The bitwise OR operation will result in a new value for `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary with the key `j` having the value `val1 | val2`; `ans[x]` is a dictionary; `j` is a key in `ans[fa[x]]`.**
