Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` contains the updated set `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which is the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` if `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged; `nowlistindex` is incremented by 1; `query[x]` and `answer[j]` remain unaffected; `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` remain such that the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.**
