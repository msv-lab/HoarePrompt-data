The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the string at `ans[x][j]`. This means that the string at this position is emptied.

Output State: **`count` is an integer, `ans[x][j]` is an empty string, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of the bitwise OR operation between the Unicode code points of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` (which is now an empty string), `ans[x][i]` for every index `i` other than `j` remains unchanged, and `ans[fa[x]][i]` for every index `i` other than `j` remains unchanged.**
