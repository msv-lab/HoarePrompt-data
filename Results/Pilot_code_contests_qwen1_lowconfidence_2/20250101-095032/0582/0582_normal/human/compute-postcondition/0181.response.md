The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the dictionary `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary with the key `j` having the value `val1 | val2`, and `j` is a key in `ans[fa[x]]`, it means that `j` exists in `ans[fa[x]]`. However, the code only affects `ans[x][j]`.

After executing the code, `ans[x][j]` is cleared, meaning it now contains no items. The other parts of the dictionaries remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary with the key `j` having the value `val1 | val2`; `ans[x]` is a dictionary; `j` is a key in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[x][j]` is an empty dictionary.**
