`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the dictionary `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[fa[x]][j]` is initially the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, clearing `ans[x][j]` does not affect the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, but `ans[x][j]` becomes an empty dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, `ans[x]` is a dictionary with an empty `ans[x][j]`, `j` is a key in both `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]`, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0.**
