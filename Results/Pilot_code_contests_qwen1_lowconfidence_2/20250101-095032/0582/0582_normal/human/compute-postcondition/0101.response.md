The code assigns the value of the tuple located at the position specified by `nowChild[x]` in the list `Child[x]` to the variable `x`. Since `Child[x]` is a list of tuples and `nowChild[x]` is an index, `x` will now hold the tuple at that index. 

Given the initial state:
- `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor).
- `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ `vi`, `ki` ≤ n).
- `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ `vi`, `ki` ≤ n).
- `NowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.

After the code execution:
- `x` is updated to the tuple located at `nowChild[x]` in `Child[x]`.
- The values of `dep` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the tuple from `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ `vi`, `ki` ≤ n)**
