`dep` is incremented by 1. The value of `nowChild` and `lenChild` remains unchanged, and the condition `nowChild[i] != lenChild[i]` for all indices i still holds true. The value of `x` is not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers where for all indices i, nowChild[i] is not equal to lenChild[i], `x` is Child[nowChild[x]][nowChild[x]], `dep` is incremented by 1**
