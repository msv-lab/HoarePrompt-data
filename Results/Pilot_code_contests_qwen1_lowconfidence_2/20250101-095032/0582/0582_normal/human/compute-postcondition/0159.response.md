Postcondition: **`nowlistindex` is incremented by 1. The length of `ans[x]` remains less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. The sets `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` remain unchanged. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` includes the bits from `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` becomes an empty set. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]`.**
