Postcondition: ***`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least 5 elements, `answer` is a list, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`, `x` must not be -1, `i` is `query[x][4]`, `nowlistindex` is 4, `j` is `query[x][5]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is `0`. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is the length of the list `ans[x][dep + i]` and `ans[x][dep]` remains as `{ss[x]}`.***
