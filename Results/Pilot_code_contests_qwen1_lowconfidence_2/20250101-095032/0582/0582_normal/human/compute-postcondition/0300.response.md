Postcondition: ***`nowChild`, `lenChild`, `ans`, `fa`, `dep`, `query`, and `answer` remain as per the precondition. If `x != 0`, then depending on the comparison of lengths of `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`, either `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to `ans[x]` and `ans[x]` becomes empty, or for each `j` in `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is either equal to `ans[x][j]` or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` if `len(ans[x][j]) >= len(ans[fa[x]][j])`. All other variables retain their original values from the precondition.***
