The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `dep`. 

- `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor).
- `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n).

The function does not have explicit return values described in the provided output cases, but rather processes the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `x` and a list `dep` and perform some operations based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x` (a list of tuples containing a string and an integer) and a parameter `dep` (a list of two positive integers).**
