Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples, `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively, the current value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, the value of `x` is not 0, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is now equal to `query[x][n + 1]`, `j` is now equal to `query[x][n + 1]`, and `answer[j]` is either 0 if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, or `len(ans[x][dep + i])` if `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`.***
