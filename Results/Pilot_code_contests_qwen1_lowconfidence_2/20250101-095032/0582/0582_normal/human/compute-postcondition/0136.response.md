Postcondition: **`ans[x]` must be a non-empty set, `query[x]` is a list of queries, `answer[j]` is 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `nowlistindex` is the last valid index processed in the loop, and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
