Postcondition: ***`ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` are lists. If `j` is in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` is not empty, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, if `j` is not in `ans[x]` or `ans[fa[x]]` is empty, `ans[x][j]` is the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is set to this updated value.***
