Postcondition: ***`ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` are lists. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty list and `ans[x][j]` performs a bitwise OR with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is updated to be `ans[fa[x]][j]`. All other elements in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` remain unchanged.***
