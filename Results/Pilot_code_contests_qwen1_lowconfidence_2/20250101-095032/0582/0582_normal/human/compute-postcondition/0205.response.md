Postcondition: ***`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers. If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, then either `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are updated according to the specified rules (if `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, update `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` accordingly; otherwise, keep `ans[x]` as an empty set and update `ans[fa[x]]`); or `nowChild` and `lenChild` are not equal at index `x`, `nowChild[x]` is updated to `Child[nowChild[x]][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is incremented by 1, and `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1. `query[x]` and `answer[j]` remain unaffected.***
