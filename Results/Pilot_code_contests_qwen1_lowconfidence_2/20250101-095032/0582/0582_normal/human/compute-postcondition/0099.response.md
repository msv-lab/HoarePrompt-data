`dep` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `dep` is not specified in the initial state. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`x` is now the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1, if `x` is not 0, `ans[x]` is either a non-empty list or an empty dictionary, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list of dictionaries, and if `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans[fa[x]]` is a copy of `ans[x]`, otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged. If `x` is 0, the postcondition does not change; `dep` is decremented by 1.**
