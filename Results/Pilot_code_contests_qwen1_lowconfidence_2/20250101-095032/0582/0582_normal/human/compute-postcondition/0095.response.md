Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `ans[x]` is either a non-empty list or an empty dictionary, and `ans[fa[x]]` is a list of dictionaries. If `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans[fa[x]]` is a copy of `ans[x]` (a non-empty list), and `ans[x]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` is a list of dictionaries and `len(ans[x]) >= len(ans[fa[x]])` still holds.***
