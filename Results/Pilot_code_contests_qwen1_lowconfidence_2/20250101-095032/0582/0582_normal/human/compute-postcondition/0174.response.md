Postcondition: **`ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` are dictionaries. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is the union of `ans[x][j]` and an empty set, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is set to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` includes all elements from both `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`.**
