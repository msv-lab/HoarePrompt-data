Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor), and `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ `vi`, `ki` ≤ n). The current value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`.***
