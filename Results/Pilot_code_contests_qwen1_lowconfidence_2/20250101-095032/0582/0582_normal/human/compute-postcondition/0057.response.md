Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists, and `j` is the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then the state remains as `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` were before the if-else block. Otherwise, if `ans[fa[x]][j]` is equal to `ans[x][j]`, the state remains unchanged. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is an empty list and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is set to `ans[x][j]`.***
