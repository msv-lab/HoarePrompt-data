Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `ans` is a list where for every index `i`, `ans[i]` is a non-empty string. After executing the if-else block, `ans[x][j]` will either be equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]` or, if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` will be equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Additionally, `len(ans[x]) >= len(ans[fa[x]])` still holds. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])` when `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be an empty list.***

This postcondition covers both scenarios within the if-else block while maintaining the original precondition and ensuring that the conditions stated in the precondition are preserved.
