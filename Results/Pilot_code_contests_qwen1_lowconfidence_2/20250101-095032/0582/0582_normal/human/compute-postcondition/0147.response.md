`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, which means all elements in `ans[fa[x]][j]` are removed. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 1, the length of `ans[x]` remains less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `query[x]` is a list of queries, `answer[j]` is 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`.**
