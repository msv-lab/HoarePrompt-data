The code snippet `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.**
