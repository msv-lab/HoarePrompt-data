The code updates `ans[fa[x]][j]` to be equal to `ans[x][j]`. This means the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now the same as `ans[x][j]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
