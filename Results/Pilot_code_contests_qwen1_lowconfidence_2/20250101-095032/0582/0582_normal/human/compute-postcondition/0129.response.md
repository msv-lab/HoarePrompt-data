Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Control Variable (`j`)**:
   - The loop variable `j` is initialized from the set `ans[x]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `ans[x]` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `ans[x]` is non-empty.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**:
   - Since the loop starts iterating over each element in `ans[x]`, the initial value of `j` should be the first element of the set `ans[x]`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `query[x]` is a list of queries, but it is not directly involved in the loop execution condition.
   - `answer[j]` is either 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. This does not affect the loop starting condition directly.
   - `nowlistindex` is the last valid index processed in the loop, but since the loop hasn't started yet, this value is irrelevant.
   - The length of `ans[x]` being less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]` is a constraint on the structure of the data but does not affect the loop starting condition directly.

### Conclusion:

The key condition for the loop to execute is that `ans[x]` must be non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `ans[x]` contains at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ans[x]` must be a non-empty set, `query[x]` is a list of queries, `answer[j]` is 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `nowlistindex` is the last valid index processed in the loop, and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`**.
