`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `ans[fa[x]]` and `j` are not altered by this operation. The precondition that `ans[fa[x]]` must be non-empty and `j` is not in `ans[x]` remains valid.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` must be non-empty, `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
