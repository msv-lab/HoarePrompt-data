Postcondition: ***`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`, `x` must not be -1, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `query[x][0]`, `nowlistindex` is 0, `j` is `query[x][1]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is already in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 1.***
