The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This updates the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to be the same as `ans[x][j]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists, and `j` is the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`**
