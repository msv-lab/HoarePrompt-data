`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list at index `j` within the list `ans[x]`. This means that the list at `ans[x][j]` is now empty. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `j` is the last `query[x][2 * k + 1]`, `ans[x][j]` is an empty list, `ans[x]` must have at least 1 element, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is 0, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`.**
