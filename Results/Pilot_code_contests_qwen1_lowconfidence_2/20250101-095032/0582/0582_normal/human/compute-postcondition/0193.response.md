Postcondition: ***`ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` are dictionaries. If `j` is not a key in `ans[x]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is reset to the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
