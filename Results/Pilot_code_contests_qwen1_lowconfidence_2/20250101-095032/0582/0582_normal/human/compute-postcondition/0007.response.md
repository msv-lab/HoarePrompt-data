Postcondition: **`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor), `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ `vi`, `ki` ≤ n), the current value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, the value of `ans[x][dep]` is the set `{ss[x]}`, the value of `x` is not 0, and `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The current value of `dep` is such that `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`.**
