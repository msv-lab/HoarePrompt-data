`i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. The value of `nowlistindex` is 0, so `i` is assigned `query[x][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}, and x must not be -1, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `query[x][0], and `nowlistindex` is 0**
