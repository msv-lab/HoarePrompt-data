The code `ans[x][j] = ans[fa[x]][j]` assigns the value of the key `j` from the dictionary `ans[fa[x]]` to the key `j` in the dictionary `ans[x]`. The variables `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` are dictionaries, and `j` is a key in both dictionaries. The values of these dictionaries remain unchanged except for the assignment made.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary that must have at least one key, `ans[x]` is a dictionary, `j` is a key in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is now equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
