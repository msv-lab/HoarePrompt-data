After executing the line `ans[fa[x]][j].clear()`, the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, meaning it is set to an empty list. However, the value of `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged from the previous state because the clear operation on `ans[fa[x]][j]` does not affect `ans[x][j]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged as well.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.**
