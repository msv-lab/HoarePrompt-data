Postcondition: ***`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `j` is the last `query[x][2 * k + 1]`, and `ans[x]` must have at least 1 element. Additionally, if `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged and `ans[x][j]` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j]`, which is the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`.***
