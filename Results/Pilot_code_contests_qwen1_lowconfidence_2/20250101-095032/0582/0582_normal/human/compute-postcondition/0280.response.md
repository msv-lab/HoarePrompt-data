Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x][j]` are lists; `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is set to this updated value.**
