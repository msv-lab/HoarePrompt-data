`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[x][j]`. After clearing, the list `ans[x][j]` will be empty. The other conditions and the structure of `ans` remain intact.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is an empty list, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is at least as long as the length of `ans[x][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`.**
