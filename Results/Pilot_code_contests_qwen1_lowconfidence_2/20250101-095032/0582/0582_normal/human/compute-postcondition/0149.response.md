Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are sets. `j` is an element at index `nowlistindex + 1` in `ans[x]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x]` becomes an empty list; otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. In all cases, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 1, and the length of `ans[x]` remains less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. `query[x]` and `answer[j]` remain unaffected.***
