`dep` is incremented by 1, changing its value from a list of `[vi, ki]` to `[vi+1, ki+1]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it was derived from `Child[x][nowChild[x]]` before the code execution.

Output State: **`x` is the tuple from `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `[vi+1, ki+1]` respectively.**
