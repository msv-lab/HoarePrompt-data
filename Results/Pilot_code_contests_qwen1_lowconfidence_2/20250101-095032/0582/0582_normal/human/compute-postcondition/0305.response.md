The code assigns `nowChild[x]` to `x`. Since `nowChild[x]` is an integer (specifically, it is an index in the `Child` list), `x` will take on the value stored at the index `nowChild[x]` in the `Child` list. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, `x` is the value at index `nowChild[x]` in the `Child` list.**
