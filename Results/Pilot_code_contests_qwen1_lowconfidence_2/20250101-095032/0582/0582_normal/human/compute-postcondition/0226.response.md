`answer[j]` is assigned the value of `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. Given the conditions, `ans[x][dep + i]` is a length of a specific list, which means `answer[j]` will be set to this length.

The initial state includes:
- `nowChild` is a list of integers
- `lenChild` is a list of integers
- `ans` is a list
- `fa` is a list
- `dep` is an integer
- `query` is a list that must have at least 5 elements
- `answer` is a list
- `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}` (though this doesn't affect the current operation)
- `x` must not be -1
- `i` is `query[x][4]`
- `nowlistindex` is 4
- `j` is `query[x][5]`
- `answer[j]` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether `dep + i` is already in `ans[x]`.

After the execution of `answer[j] = len(ans[x][dep + i])`, the value of `answer[j]` changes to the length of the list `ans[x][dep + i]`.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least 5 elements, `answer` is a list, `answer[j]` is the length of the list `ans[x][dep + i]`, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`, `x` must not be -1, `i` is `query[x][4]`, `nowlistindex` is 4, `j` is `query[x][5]`.**
