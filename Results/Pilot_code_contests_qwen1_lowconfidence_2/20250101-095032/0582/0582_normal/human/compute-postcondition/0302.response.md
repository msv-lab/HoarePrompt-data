The code updates the value of `nowChild[x]` by incrementing it by 1. The variable `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`. The states of the other variables (`lenChild`, `ans`, `fa`, `dep`, `query`, and `answer`) are not affected.

Output State: **`nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1; `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`; `lenChild`, `ans`, `fa`, `dep`, `query`, and `answer` remain as per the precondition**
