`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The value of `nowlistindex` is not specified, but it is known that `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, so `nowlistindex + 1` is valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor), `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ `vi`, `ki` ≤ n), the current value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, the value of `ans[x][dep]` is the set `{ss[x]}`, the value of `x` is not 0, and `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is `query[x][nowlistindex]`; `j` is `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`.
