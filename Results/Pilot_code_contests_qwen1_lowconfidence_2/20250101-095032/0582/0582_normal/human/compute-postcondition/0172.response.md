`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[x][j]`. This means that all elements in `ans[x][j]` are removed, leaving it as an empty list. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is non-empty and includes all the bits from `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`; `j` is in `ans[x]`; the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is at least the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` before the operation; `ans[x][j]` is an empty list.**
