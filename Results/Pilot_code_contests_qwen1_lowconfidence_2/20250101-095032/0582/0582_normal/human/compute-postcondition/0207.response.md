`ans[x][dep]` is assigned the value `{ss[x]}`, where `ss[x]` is a specific value (since `x` must not be -1, it implies `x` is a valid index). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}, and x must not be -1.**
