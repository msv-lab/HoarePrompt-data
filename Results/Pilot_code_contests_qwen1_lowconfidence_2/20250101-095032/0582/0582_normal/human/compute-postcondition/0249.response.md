`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, which means all elements in the list `ans[fa[x]][j]` are removed. The length of the list becomes 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `j` must be the next element in `ans[x]`, and `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.**
