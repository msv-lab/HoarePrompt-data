The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list `ans[x][j]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list with at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `j` is the next index, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the result of `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is an empty list**
