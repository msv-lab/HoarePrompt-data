`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The previous state was that `ans[fa[x]][j]` is `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is an empty list. Since `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now assigned to `ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is no longer an empty list but equals `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is `ans[fa[x]][j] | ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is now `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][k]` remains unchanged for all k != j, `ans[fa[x]][k]` remains unchanged for all k**
