Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor). `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`. If `x` is not 0, and `count` is an integer, `ans[x]` is either a non-empty list or an empty dictionary, and `ans[fa[x]]` is a list of dictionaries. The postcondition ensures that if `len(ans[x]) < len(ans[fa[x]])`, then `ans[fa[x]]` is a copy of `ans[x]`, and `ans[x]` remains unchanged. If `len(ans[x]) >= len(ans[fa[x]])`, `ans[fa[x]]` remains a list of dictionaries, and the length condition still holds. If `x` is 0, the postcondition does not change.***
