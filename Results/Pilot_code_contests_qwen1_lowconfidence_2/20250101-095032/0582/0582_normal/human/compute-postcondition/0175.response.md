Postcondition: ***`ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]` are dictionaries. If `j` is not in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` is non-empty, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, the postcondition depends on the lengths of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`: if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater, then `ans[x][j]` is the union of `ans[x][j]` and an empty set, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is set to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` includes all elements from both `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`.***
