Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` must have at least one element, and `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
