Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor), `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively (1 ≤ `vi`, `ki` ≤ n), the current value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, the value of `ans[x][dep]` is the set `{ss[x]}`, the value of `x` is not 0, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is now equal to `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is `query[x][k + 3]`, and if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is 1.**
