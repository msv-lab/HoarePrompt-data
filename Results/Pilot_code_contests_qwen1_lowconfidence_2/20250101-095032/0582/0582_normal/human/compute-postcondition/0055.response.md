The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` updates the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to be the same as `ans[x][j]`. Based on the initial state, `ans[fa[x]][j]` was an empty list, but now it will be updated to be equal to `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists; `j` is the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed; `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now equal to `ans[x][j]`.**
