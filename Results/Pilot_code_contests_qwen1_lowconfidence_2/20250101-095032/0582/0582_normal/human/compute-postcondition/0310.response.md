Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a tree structure represented by the list `x` and performs operations based on the `query` list. It updates the `ans` dictionary with the results of queries and propagates these results up the tree to their respective parents. The function iterates through the nodes of the tree, updating the `nowChild` and `lenChild` lists to ensure they match. If a node is a leaf or no longer a child of another node, the function stops. After executing, the function ensures that each node's `nowChild` value equals its `lenChild` value, and the `ans` dictionary is properly updated based on the queries. The `fa` list holds the parent information, and the `answer` list is updated based on the results of the queries.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is empty or `dep` is invalid (not a list of two positive integers), the function should handle these cases appropriately, possibly raising an error or returning a specific value.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly handle cases where `x` contains nodes that do not have corresponding entries in `fa`, `nowChild`, or `lenChild`. This could lead to errors if such nodes exist.
- There is no validation or handling for the case where `query[x]` contains invalid indices or values that do not correspond to valid nodes in the tree.
- The code assumes that `ss`, `vi`, `ki`, and `answer` are defined and initialized elsewhere, which might not be clear from the given code snippet.
