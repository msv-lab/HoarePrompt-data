The code `ans[fa[x]][j] = ans[x][j]` assigns the value of `ans[x][j]` to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that the contents of `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be updated to match `ans[x][j]`. 

- `ans[x][j]` is updated in such a way that its value is copied to `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
- All other variables (`nowChild`, `lenChild`, `dep`, `query`, `x`, `i`, `nowlistindex`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list that must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `x` must not be -1, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `j` is the last `query[x][2 * k + 1]`, `ans[x][j]` is now updated to the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is now an empty list.**
