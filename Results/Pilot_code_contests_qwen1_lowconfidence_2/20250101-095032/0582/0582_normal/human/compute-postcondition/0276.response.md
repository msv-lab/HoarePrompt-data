Postcondition: ***`ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` are lists. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is set to the updated value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
