Postcondition: ***`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`, `x` must not be -1, `query` must have at least `2 * len(query[x])` elements, `i` is the last `query[x][2 * k]` where `k` is the number of iterations, `nowlistindex` is the last `2 * k - 2`, `j` is the last `query[x][2 * k + 1]`, and for each `j`, `answer[j]` is either `0` or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` if `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. Additionally, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
