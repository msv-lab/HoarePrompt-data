The code assigns the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` to `ans[x][j]`. According to the initial state, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is `val1 | val2`, which means it is a combined value. This assignment will update `ans[x][j]` to have the same value as `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary with the key `j` having the value `val1 | val2`; `ans[x]` is a dictionary; `j` is a key in `ans[fa[x]]`; `ans[x][j]` is a dictionary with the same value as `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which is `val1 | val2`.**
