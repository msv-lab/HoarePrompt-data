Postcondition: **`count` is an integer, `ans` is a list where for every index `i`, `ans[i]` is a non-empty string. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is equal to `ans[fa[x]][j]`, and `ans[x][i]` (for `i != j`) and `ans[i]` (for all other indices) remain as before. Additionally, `len(ans[x]) >= len(ans[fa[x]])` still holds.**
