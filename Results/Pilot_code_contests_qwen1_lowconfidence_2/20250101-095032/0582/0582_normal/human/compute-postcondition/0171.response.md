`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`. The length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` will now be at least as long as the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` before the operation, and it will include all the bits that were set in `ans[x][j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` is non-empty and includes all the bits from `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`; `j` is in `ans[x]`; the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is at least the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` before the operation.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is non-empty and includes all the bits from `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`; `j` is in `ans[x]`; the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is at least the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` before the operation.**
