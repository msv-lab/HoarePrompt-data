Postcondition: **`ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary that must have at least one key, `ans[x]` is a dictionary, `j` is a key in both `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]`. After executing the if-else block, if `j` is not a key in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is set to the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is already a key in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged.**
