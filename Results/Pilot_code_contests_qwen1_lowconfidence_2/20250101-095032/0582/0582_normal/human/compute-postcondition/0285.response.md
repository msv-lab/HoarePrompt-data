Postcondition: ***`ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x][j]` are lists. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to `ans[fa[x]][j]` or the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` (whichever is applicable). Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is set to this updated value.***
