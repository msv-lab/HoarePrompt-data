The code `j = query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` updates the value of `j`. Given the initial state, `nowlistindex` is 4, so `nowlistindex + 1` is 5. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value of the fifth element of `query[x]`. Since `i` is already the fifth element of `query[x]`, `j` will now hold the same value as `i`.

Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is 4, `query[x]` must have at least 7 elements, `i` is the fifth element of `query[x]`, `j` is the fifth element of `query[x]`**
