Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `x != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `x` is not equal to -1.

2. **Identify the Relevant States**: 
   - `nowChild`: A list of integers.
   - `lenChild`: A list of integers.
   - `ans`: A list where elements may be updated based on certain conditions.
   - `fa`: A list representing the parent of each node in the tree.
   - `query`: A list that remains unaffected.
   - `answer`: A list that remains unaffected.
   - `x`: An integer that drives the loop and gets updated within the loop.
   - `dep`: An integer that is incremented within the loop.

3. **Analyze the Loop Body**: 
   - If `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, specific updates are made to `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`.
   - If `nowChild[x]` does not equal `lenChild[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is updated, `dep` is incremented, and `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1.
   - `query[x]` and `answer[j]` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the State Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must not be equal to -1.
   - Since `x` can change within the loop, we need to ensure that the loop can still run with the updated `x`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The only state that directly controls the continuation of the loop is `x`. It must be adjusted to a value such that `x != -1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Other states like `nowChild`, `lenChild`, `ans`, `fa`, `dep`, `query`, and `answer` do not affect the loop condition directly and can remain as they are since their values do not influence whether the loop continues.

Therefore, the state adjustment required is simply ensuring that `x` is not -1 at the start of the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, and `x` must not be -1**.
