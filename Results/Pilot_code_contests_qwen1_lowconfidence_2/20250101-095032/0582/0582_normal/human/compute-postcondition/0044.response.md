The code snippet performs a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This means that the value of `ans[x][j]` will be updated to include any bits from `ans[fa[x]][j]` that are set to 1.

- `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`.
- The value of `ans[fa[x]]` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`ans[x][j]` is updated to `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]]` is unchanged, and `j` is unchanged.**
