The code snippet assigns the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]` to `j`. Given the initial state, `nowlistindex` is 2, so `nowlistindex + 1` is 3. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][3]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`, `x` must not be -1, `query[x]` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `query[x][2]`, `nowlistindex` is 2, `j` is `query[x][3]`.**
