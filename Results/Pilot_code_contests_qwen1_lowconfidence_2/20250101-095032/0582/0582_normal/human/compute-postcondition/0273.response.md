`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union (|) of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. Since `ans[fa[x]][j]` must not be empty and `j` is in `ans[x]`, the value of `ans[x][j]` is added to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The length condition is maintained as the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is not specified to change but must remain greater than or equal to the length of `ans[x][j]`.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty, and `j` is in `ans[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, maintaining the length condition.**
