Postcondition: **`ans[fa[x]]` is a dictionary that must have at least one key; `ans[x]` is a dictionary; `j` is a key in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the result of `ans[x][j] | ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is a dictionary with the same value as `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which is `val1 | val2`.**
