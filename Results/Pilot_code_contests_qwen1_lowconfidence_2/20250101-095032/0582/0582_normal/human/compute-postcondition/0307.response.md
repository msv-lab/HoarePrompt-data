Postcondition: **`nowChild`, `lenChild`, `ans`, `fa`, `query`, and `answer` remain as per the precondition; `dep` is either decremented by 1 if `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, or incremented by 1 if this condition is false. `x` is either updated to the value of `fa[x]` if `nowChild[x]` equals `lenChild[x]`, or set to the value at index `nowChild[x]` in the `Child` list.**
