`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared using the `clear()` method, which removes all elements from the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists; `j` is the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed; `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list.
