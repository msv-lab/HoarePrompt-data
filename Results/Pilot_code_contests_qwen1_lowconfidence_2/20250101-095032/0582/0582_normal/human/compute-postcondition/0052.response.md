The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list at the index `j` of `ans[x]`. This means that the list stored at `ans[x][j]` is emptied.

- `ans[x][j]` was previously a list.
- After executing the code, `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list.

The other variables and their states remain unchanged:
- `ans[fa[x]]` remains a list.
- `j` is still the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed.

Output State: **`ans[x][j]` is an empty list; `ans[fa[x]]` is a list; `j` is the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed**
