Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, and for each `j` in `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is either equal to `ans[x][j]` or `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to be the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` if `len(ans[x][j]) >= len(ans[fa[x]][j])`. Additionally, `ans[x]` is an empty list, and `x` must not be -1.**
