Postcondition: **`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists. For each key `j`, if `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` remains unchanged and is equal to `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, then if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
