The code `i = query[x][nowlistindex]` assigns the value of `query[x][2]` (since `nowlistindex` is 2) to the variable `i`. The value of `i` is the third element of `query[x]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is 2, `query[x]` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `query[x]`, `j` is the fourth element of `query[x]`**
