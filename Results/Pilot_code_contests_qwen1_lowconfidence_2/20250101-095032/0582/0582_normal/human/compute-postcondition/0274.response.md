`ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list `ans[x][j]`. This means that the list `ans[x][j]` is now empty.

Output State: **`ans[fa[x]]` must not be empty, and `j` is in `ans[x]`; `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the union of its original value and `ans[x][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is now an empty list, maintaining the length condition.**
