`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. Given the initial state, `nowlistindex` is 0, so `nowlistindex + 1` is 1. Therefore, `j` gets the second element from `query[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `nowlistindex` is 0, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the first element of `query[x]`, `j` is the second element of `query[x]`**
