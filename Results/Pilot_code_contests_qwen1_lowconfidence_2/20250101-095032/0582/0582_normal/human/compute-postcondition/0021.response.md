The code sets `answer[j]` to 0. This means that regardless of the previous value of `answer[j]`, it is now explicitly set to 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples, `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `vi` and `ki` respectively, the current value of `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, the value of `x` is not 0, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is now equal to `query[x][n + 1]`, `j` is now equal to `query[x][n + 1]`, and `answer[j]` is 0.**
