Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name (string) and an integer representing the direct ancestor index (or 0 if no direct ancestor). `dep` is a list of length 2 containing two positive integers `[vi, ki]`. If `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]` and `x` is not 0, `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `nowChild[x]` is reset to 0 and `x` is set to the tuple from `Child[x][nowChild[x]]` if `x` is 0. If `x` is not 0, `ans[x]` is updated according to the specified conditions, and `dep` is decremented by 1. If `nowChild[x] != lenChild[x]`, the state remains unchanged.***
