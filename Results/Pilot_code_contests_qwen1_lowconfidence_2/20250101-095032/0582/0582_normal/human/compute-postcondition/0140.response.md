Postcondition: ***`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are sets. If `len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` maintain their original states, with `ans[x][j]` being a non-empty set and `ans[fa[x]][j]` being a non-empty set. `query[x]` is a list of queries, `answer[j]` is 0 or the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` depending on whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `nowlistindex` is the last valid index processed in the loop, and the length of `ans[x]` remains less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
