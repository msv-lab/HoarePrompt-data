`answer[j]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `j` is `query[x][1]`, so `answer[query[x][1]]` is now `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 

- `nowChild` is a list of integers
- `lenChild` is a list of integers
- `ans` is a list
- `fa` is a list
- `dep` is an integer
- `query` is a list
- `answer` is a list
- `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`
- `x` must not be -1
- `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements
- `i` is `query[x][0]`
- the current value of `nowlistindex` is 0
- `j` is `query[x][1]`
- `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`
- `answer[query[x][1]]` is `0`

Output State: **`nowChild` is a list of integers, `lenChild` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list, `fa` is a list, `dep` is an integer, `query` is a list, `answer` is a list, `ans[x][dep]` is `{ss[x]}`, `x` must not be -1, `query[x]` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `query[x][0]`, the current value of `nowlistindex` is 0, `j` is `query[x][1]`, `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[query[x][1]]` is `0**
