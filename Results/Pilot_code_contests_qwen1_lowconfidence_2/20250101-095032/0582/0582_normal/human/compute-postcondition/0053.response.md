The code `ans[x][j] |= ans[fa[x]][j]` performs a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. This operation updates the value of `ans[x][j]` to include all bits that are set in either `ans[x][j]` or `ans[fa[x]][j]`.

Given that `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists and `j` is an index, the value of `ans[x][j]` is updated based on the bitwise OR operation with the corresponding element from `ans[fa[x]]`.

Therefore, the output state after executing this line of code is:

Output State: **`ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are lists; `j` is the next key in `ans[x]` that has not yet been processed; `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
