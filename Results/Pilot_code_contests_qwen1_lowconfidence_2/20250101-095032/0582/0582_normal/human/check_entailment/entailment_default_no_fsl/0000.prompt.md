You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarpus got hold of a family tree. The found tree describes the family relations of n people, numbered from 1 to n. Every person in this tree has at most one direct ancestor. Also, each person in the tree has a name, the names are not necessarily unique.

We call the man with a number a a 1-ancestor of the man with a number b, if the man with a number a is a direct ancestor of the man with a number b.

We call the man with a number a a k-ancestor (k > 1) of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b has a 1-ancestor, and the man with a number a is a (k - 1)-ancestor of the 1-ancestor of the man with a number b.

In the tree the family ties do not form cycles. In other words there isn't a person who is his own direct or indirect ancestor (that is, who is an x-ancestor of himself, for some x, x > 0).

We call a man with a number a the k-son of the man with a number b, if the man with a number b is a k-ancestor of the man with a number a.

Polycarpus is very much interested in how many sons and which sons each person has. He took a piece of paper and wrote m pairs of numbers vi, ki. Help him to learn for each pair vi, ki the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of people in the tree. Next n lines contain the description of people in the tree. The i-th line contains space-separated string si and integer ri (0 ≤ ri ≤ n), where si is the name of the man with a number i, and ri is either the number of the direct ancestor of the man with a number i or 0, if the man with a number i has no direct ancestor. 

The next line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of Polycarpus's records. Next m lines contain space-separated pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers vi, ki (1 ≤ vi, ki ≤ n).

It is guaranteed that the family relationships do not form cycles. The names of all people are non-empty strings, consisting of no more than 20 lowercase English letters.

Output

Print m whitespace-separated integers — the answers to Polycarpus's records. Print the answers to the records in the order, in which the records occur in the input.

```
Output hints: The function `func_1` processes a tree structure represented by the list `x` and performs operations based on the `query` list. It updates the `ans` dictionary with the results of queries and propagates these results up the tree to their respective parents. The function iterates through the nodes of the tree, updating the `nowChild` and `lenChild` lists to ensure they match. If a node is a leaf or no longer a child of another node, the function stops. After executing, the function ensures that each node's `nowChild` value equals its `lenChild` value, and the `ans` dictionary is properly updated based on the queries. The `fa` list holds the parent information, and the `answer` list is updated based on the results of the queries.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
