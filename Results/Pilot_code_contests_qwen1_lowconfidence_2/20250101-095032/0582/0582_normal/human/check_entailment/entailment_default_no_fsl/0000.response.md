Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when a person has multiple children with the same name. Specifically, the code uses a set to store names, which means that if multiple children have the same name, it will only count that name once. This does not accurately reflect the requirement to count distinct names among all names of the k-sons of the man with number \(v_i\).

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
6
valera 0
valera 1
valera 1
gerald 0
valera 4
kolya 4
7
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
4 1
5 1
6 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
2
0
0
2
0
0
```

However, the provided code will produce the following output due to the use of sets:
```
1
0
0
0
2
0
0
```

This discrepancy shows that the code does not correctly count distinct names. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
