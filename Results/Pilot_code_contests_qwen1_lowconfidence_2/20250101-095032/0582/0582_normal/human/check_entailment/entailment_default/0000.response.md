Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the required functionality for counting the number of distinct names among all names of the \(k\)-sons of a given person. Specifically, the `func_1` function is incomplete and lacks proper logic to propagate the results of the queries up the tree structure correctly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Propagation Logic**: The propagation logic in `func_1` is incorrect and does not ensure that the results of the queries are correctly propagated to the parent nodes. The current implementation attempts to merge sets of names but does not handle the merging and clearing of sets appropriately.

2. **Query Handling**: The `query` list is incorrectly used. Each query should be processed and the results should be stored in the `ans` dictionary, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Termination Condition**: The termination condition in the while loop within `func_1` is flawed. It checks whether `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]`, which is not sufficient to ensure the correct processing of all nodes.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
