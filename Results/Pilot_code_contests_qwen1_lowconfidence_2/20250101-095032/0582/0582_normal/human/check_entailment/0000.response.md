Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly traversing the family tree to compute the number of distinct names among the k-sons for each query. There are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Traversal Logic**: The traversal logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the recursive nature of the family tree. It should recursively traverse all descendants and compute the distinct names, but the current implementation seems to miss this recursive step.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The program does not properly handle the queries and compute the distinct names of k-sons. The variable `nowChild` and its usage in the logic are not clear and do not seem to be used correctly to manage the depth of the recursion.

3. **Incorrect Data Structures**: The use of sets and dictionaries for storing names and results is not appropriately managed. For instance, the `ans` dictionary should store the distinct names, but the current implementation does not ensure that all relevant names are collected and counted correctly.

Here is an example where the program might fail:

Consider the following input:
```
6
pasha 0
gerald 1
gerald 1
valera 2
igor 3
olesya 1
5
1 1
1 2
1 3
3 1
6 1
```

For the query `1 1`, the expected output is `2` because "pasha" and "gerald" are the 1-sons of "pasha".

For the query `1 2`, the expected output is `2` because "pasha" and "gerald" are the 2-sons of "pasha".

However, the current implementation may not correctly compute these values due to the issues mentioned above. This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
