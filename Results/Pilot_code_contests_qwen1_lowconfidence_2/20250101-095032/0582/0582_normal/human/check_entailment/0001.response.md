Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple children share the same name but are at different levels of ancestry. This can lead to incorrect counts of distinct names among the k-sons.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
valera 0
valera 1
valera 1
gerald 0
valera 4
kolya 4
7
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
4 1
5 1
6 1
```

Expected output:
```
1
0
0
0
2
0
0
```

However, the provided program might output:
```
1
0
0
0
1
0
0
```

This is because the program does not properly track and count distinct names across different levels of ancestry. Specifically, the program does not correctly update the `ans` dictionary to ensure that distinct names are counted correctly across different levels of ancestry.

To fix this issue, the program needs to ensure that it correctly tracks and updates the distinct names for each level of ancestry, rather than just updating the `ans` dictionary with the current set of names without considering previous levels.
