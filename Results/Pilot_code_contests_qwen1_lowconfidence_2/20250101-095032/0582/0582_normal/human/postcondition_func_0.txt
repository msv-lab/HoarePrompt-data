The function `func_1` processes a tree structure represented by the list `x` and performs operations based on the `query` list. It updates the `ans` dictionary with the results of queries and propagates these results up the tree to their respective parents. The function iterates through the nodes of the tree, updating the `nowChild` and `lenChild` lists to ensure they match. If a node is a leaf or no longer a child of another node, the function stops. After executing, the function ensures that each node's `nowChild` value equals its `lenChild` value, and the `ans` dictionary is properly updated based on the queries. The `fa` list holds the parent information, and the `answer` list is updated based on the results of the queries.
