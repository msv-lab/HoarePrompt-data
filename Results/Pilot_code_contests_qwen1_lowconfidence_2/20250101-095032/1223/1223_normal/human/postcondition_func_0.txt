The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns a value based on an internal 4-character string `s`, which is expected to consist of uppercase English letters. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains exactly two characters, each appearing twice, then `func_2('Yes')` is called; otherwise, `func_2('No')` is called. This means that the function checks if the given string `s` is composed of exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. If this condition is met, it returns `'Yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'No'`.
