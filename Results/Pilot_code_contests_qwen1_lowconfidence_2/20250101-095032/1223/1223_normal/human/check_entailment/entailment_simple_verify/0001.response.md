Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to check if a 4-character string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a 4-character string `S` from the input.
2. **Character Counting**: Using the `Counter` from the `collections` module, it counts the occurrences of each character in `S`.
3. **Condition Checking**: The program checks if the counts of the characters are exactly `[2, 2]`, ensuring that there are exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice.
4. **Output**: Based on the condition check, it prints `Yes` or `No`.

The annotations confirm that the program behaves as intended, reading a valid 4-character string and correctly evaluating whether it meets the specified criteria. The original assessment of correctness is supported by the annotations and the logical flow of the program. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
