You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    s = Counter(input()).values()
    func_2('Yes' if s == [2, 2] else 'No')
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns a value based on an internal 4-character string `s`, which is expected to consist of uppercase English letters. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains exactly two characters, each appearing twice, then `func_2('Yes')` is called; otherwise, `func_2('No')` is called. This means that the function checks if the given string `s` is composed of exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. If this condition is met, it returns `'Yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'No'`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It concatenates the string representations of all elements in an iterable `args`, separated by a specified separator `sep`, and writes the result to a file object `file`. The final character written to `file` is determined by the value of the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the contents of `file` are immediately written to the underlying device. The function handles an empty `args` by writing nothing to `file`. If `args` is not an iterable, an error will occur during iteration. Additionally, the function does not check for the presence of the `sep` and `end` keyword arguments in `kwargs`, and it assumes they are provided as positional arguments if they are not explicitly passed.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
