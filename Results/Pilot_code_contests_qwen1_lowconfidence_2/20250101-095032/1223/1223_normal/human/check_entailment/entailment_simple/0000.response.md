Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description Requirements**:
   - The function should determine if a given 4-character string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice in `S`.
   - The output should be `Yes` if the condition is met, and `No` otherwise.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the input string `S`.
   - It then checks if the counts are exactly `[2, 2]`, which means there are exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice.
   - However, the implementation of this logic is flawed because:
     - The `Counter` object returns a dictionary-like object where keys are characters and values are their counts.
     - Simply comparing the values to `[2, 2]` is not sufficient. For instance, if the counts were `[2, 2, 0, 0]` or `[2, 1, 1, 0]`, the program would incorrectly return `True` even though the string does not meet the exact requirement of having exactly two kinds of characters each appearing twice.

3. **Example Cases**:
   - **Example 1**: `ASSA`
     - Expected Output: `Yes`
     - Actual Output: `Yes` (Correct)
   - **Example 2**: `STOP`
     - Expected Output: `No`
     - Actual Output: `No` (Correct)
   - **Example 3**: `FFEE`
     - Expected Output: `Yes`
     - Actual Output: `Yes` (Correct)
   - **Example 4**: `FREE`
     - Expected Output: `No`
     - Actual Output: `No` (Correct)

However, the issue arises when the counts are not exactly `[2, 2]` but still meet the requirement. For example:

- **Example 5**: `ABAB`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `No` (Incorrect)
- **Example 6**: `AABB`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `No` (Incorrect)

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the solution, you should ensure that:
- There are exactly two distinct characters.
- Each of these two characters appears exactly twice.

Here's how you can modify the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1():
    s = input()  # Read the input string
    counter = Counter(s)
    
    # Check if there are exactly 2 distinct characters and each appears exactly twice
    if len(counter) == 2 and all(value == 2 for value in counter.values()):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

With this implementation, the program correctly checks if the string meets the required conditions and prints `Yes` or `No` accordingly.
