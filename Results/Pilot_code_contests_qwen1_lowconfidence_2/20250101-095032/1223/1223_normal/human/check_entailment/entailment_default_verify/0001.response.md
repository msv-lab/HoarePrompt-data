Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly checks if the input string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each character in `S`, and the program checks if the counts are exactly `[2, 2]`. The function `func_2` handles the output printing as specified in the problem description, and the examples provided demonstrate the program's correctness. There are no contradictions between the program's functionality and the problem description or the output hints.
