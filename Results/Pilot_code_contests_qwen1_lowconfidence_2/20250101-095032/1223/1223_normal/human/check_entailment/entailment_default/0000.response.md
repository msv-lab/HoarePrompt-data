Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the given 4-character string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. Let's analyze the code:

1. The `func_1` function reads the input string `S` and uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. It then checks if the counts of the characters are `[2, 2]`. If they are, it calls `func_2('Yes')`, indicating that the string meets the criteria. Otherwise, it calls `func_2('No')`, indicating that the string does not meet the criteria.

Given the constraints:
- The length of `S` is 4.
- `S` consists of uppercase English letters.

The code correctly implements the logic to verify if `S` contains exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice. Here are some test cases to confirm this:

- For `S = "ASSA"`: The characters are `A` and `S`, both appearing twice. The function correctly returns `Yes`.
- For `S = "STOP"`: The characters are `S`, `T`, `O`, and `P`, none of which appear twice. The function correctly returns `No`.
- For `S = "FFEE"`: The characters are `F` and `E`, both appearing twice. The function correctly returns `Yes`.
- For `S = "FREE"`: The characters are `F`, `R`, `E`, and `E`, where `E` appears twice and `F` and `R` appear once. The function correctly returns `No`.

Since the code correctly implements the logic for all potential cases within the given constraints, the program is correct.
