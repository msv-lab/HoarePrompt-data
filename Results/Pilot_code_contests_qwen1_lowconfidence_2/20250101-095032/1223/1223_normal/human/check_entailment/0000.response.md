Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if a 4-character string consists of exactly two kinds of characters which both appear twice. The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each character but does not properly verify that there are exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.

For example, consider the input "AAAA":
- The counter will output `{ 'A': 4 }`, which does not match the condition of having exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.
- The program will incorrectly return "No" for this input, which does not meet the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that there are exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. Here is a corrected version:

```python
from collections import Counter

def check_string(s):
    char_counts = Counter(s)
    # Check if there are exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice
    if len(char_counts) == 2 and all(count == 2 for count in char_counts.values()):
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"

s = input().strip()
print(check_string(s))
```

This corrected version will correctly identify strings like "ASSA" and "FFEE" as "Yes" and strings like "STOP" and "FREE" as "No".
