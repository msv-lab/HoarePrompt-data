Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the input string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a 4-character string `S`.
2. **Counting Characters**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each character in `S`.
3. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks if the counts of the characters are exactly `[2, 2]`. This ensures that there are exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice.
4. **Output**: Based on the condition check, it prints `Yes` or `No`.

Given the constraints and examples provided, the program correctly handles all potential cases:

- **Example 1**: `ASSA` -> `Yes` (A appears twice, S appears twice)
- **Example 2**: `STOP` -> `No` (All characters are distinct)
- **Example 3**: `FFEE` -> `Yes` (F appears twice, E appears twice)
- **Example 4**: `FREE` -> `No` (F and R appear once, E appears twice)

The program correctly identifies strings with exactly two kinds of characters each appearing twice and distinguishes them from other cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
