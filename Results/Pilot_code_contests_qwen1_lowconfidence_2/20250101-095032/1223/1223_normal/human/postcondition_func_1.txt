The function `func_2()` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It concatenates the string representations of all elements in an iterable `args`, separated by a specified separator `sep`, and writes the result to a file object `file`. The final character written to `file` is determined by the value of the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the contents of `file` are immediately written to the underlying device. The function handles an empty `args` by writing nothing to `file`. If `args` is not an iterable, an error will occur during iteration. Additionally, the function does not check for the presence of the `sep` and `end` keyword arguments in `kwargs`, and it assumes they are provided as positional arguments if they are not explicitly passed.
