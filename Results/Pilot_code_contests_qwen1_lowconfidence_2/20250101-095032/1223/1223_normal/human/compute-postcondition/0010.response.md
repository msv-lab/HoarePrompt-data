`file` writes the string representation of `sep`. The variable `at_start` remains unchanged, and `args` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `file` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable containing at least one element.
