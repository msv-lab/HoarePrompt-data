The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file `file`. Since `file` initially contains the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`, writing `str(x)` again appends the string representation of `x` to the existing content. The other variables (`at_start` and `args`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`file` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by `sep` and then another instance of the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable containing at least one element.**
