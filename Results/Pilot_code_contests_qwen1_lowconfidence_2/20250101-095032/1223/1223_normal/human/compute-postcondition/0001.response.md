The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` involves popping values from a dictionary (`kwargs`) and assigning them to `sep` and `file`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`. 

Let's break down the code:

1. `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`: This line tries to pop the value associated with the key `'sep'` from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the key `'sep'` exists in `kwargs`, its value is popped and assigned to `sep`. If the key does not exist, the default value `' '` (a single space) is assigned to `sep`.

2. `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`: Similarly, this line tries to pop the value associated with the key `'file'` from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the key `'file'` exists in `kwargs`, its value is popped and assigned to `file`. If the key does not exist, the default value `sys.stdout` (the standard output stream) is assigned to `file`.

Since the initial state does not provide any information about `kwargs`, we cannot determine the exact values of `sep` and `file` without making assumptions. However, we can express the possible states:

- If `'sep'` is in `kwargs`, then `sep` is set to the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs`.
- If `'sep'` is not in `kwargs`, then `sep` is set to `' '`.
- If `'file'` is in `kwargs`, then `file` is set to the value of `'file'` in `kwargs`.
- If `'file'` is not in `kwargs`, then `file` is set to `sys.stdout`.

Given the lack of initial values for these variables, the most general output state would be:

Output State: **`sep` is either the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs` or `' '`, `file` is either the value of `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`**
