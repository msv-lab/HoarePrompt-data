`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The value of `sep` is added to the content of `file`, but the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep` and then another instance of the string representation of the next `x`, `sep` is written to `file`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable containing at least one element, `at_start` is `False`.
