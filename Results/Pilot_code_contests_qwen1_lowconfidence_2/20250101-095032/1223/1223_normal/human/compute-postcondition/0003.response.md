To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- The state before the for loop starts:
  - `sep` is either the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs` or `' '`.
  - `file` is either the value of `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.
  - `at_start` is `True`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `args`:**
   - For the loop `for x in args` to execute, `args` must be a non-empty iterable (a list, tuple, etc.). If `args` is empty, the loop body will not be executed even once.
   
2. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. These are more related to the context in which the loop is being used, such as formatting output or determining where to write it. However, since these do not influence the basic execution condition of the loop, they do not need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to start.

### Conclusion:
The key adjustment needed for the loop to execute is ensuring that `args` is a non-empty iterable. Therefore, we need to modify the initial state to reflect this requirement.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sep` is either the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs` or `' '`, `file` is either the value of `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable**.
