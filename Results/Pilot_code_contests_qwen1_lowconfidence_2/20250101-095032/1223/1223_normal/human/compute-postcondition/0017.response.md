The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. This means that the content of `file` will be updated to include the string representation of `x`. The other parts of the initial state (such as `at_start`, `sep`, and the existing content in `file`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep` and then another instance of the string representation of the next `x`, and the content of `file` is updated to include the string representation of `x`. `at_start` is `False`, the separator `sep` is written to `file` if necessary. `args` must be a non-empty iterable containing at least one element.**
