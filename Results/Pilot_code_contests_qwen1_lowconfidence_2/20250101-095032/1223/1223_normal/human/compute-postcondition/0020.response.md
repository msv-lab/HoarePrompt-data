The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `file` object by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to it. The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` method removes and returns the value of the `'end'` key from `kwargs`, with a default value of `\n` if the key does not exist.

Given the initial state:
- `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `args` must be a non-empty iterable.

After executing the code, the `file` object will write the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to itself. Since no specific value for `kwargs` is given, we keep it as `kwargs`, which means the `file` now includes the content it previously had plus the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.

Output State: **`file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable.**
