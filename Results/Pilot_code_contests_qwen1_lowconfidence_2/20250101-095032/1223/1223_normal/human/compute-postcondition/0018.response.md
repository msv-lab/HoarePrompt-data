The variable `at_start` is reassigned to `False`, which means its new value is `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the string representation of the next `x` followed by `sep` and then another instance of the string representation of the next `x`, and the content of `file` is updated to include the string representation of `x`. `at_start` is `False`, the separator `sep` is written to `file` if necessary. `args` must be a non-empty iterable containing at least one element.**
