#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a 4-character string consisting of uppercase English letters.
def func_1():
    s = Counter(input()).values()
    func_2('Yes' if s == [2, 2] else 'No')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns a value based on an internal 4-character string `s`, which is expected to consist of uppercase English letters. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains exactly two characters, each appearing twice, then `func_2('Yes')` is called; otherwise, `func_2('No')` is called. This means that the function checks if the given string `s` is composed of exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. If this condition is met, it returns `'Yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables provided in the function signature directly relate to the problem description. The function does not take any arguments and its purpose seems to be printing to a stream or standard output, which is not relevant to the problem of checking if a 4-character string consists of exactly two kinds of characters each appearing twice.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must be a non-empty iterable.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`file` is flushed if the value of the 'flush' key in `kwargs` was `True`. Otherwise, `file` remains unchanged, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and the current value of `kwargs` has had its 'flush' key popped.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It concatenates the string representations of all elements in an iterable `args`, separated by a specified separator `sep`, and writes the result to a file object `file`. The final character written to `file` is determined by the value of the `end` keyword argument. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the contents of `file` are immediately written to the underlying device. The function handles an empty `args` by writing nothing to `file`. If `args` is not an iterable, an error will occur during iteration. Additionally, the function does not check for the presence of the `sep` and `end` keyword arguments in `kwargs`, and it assumes they are provided as positional arguments if they are not explicitly passed.
