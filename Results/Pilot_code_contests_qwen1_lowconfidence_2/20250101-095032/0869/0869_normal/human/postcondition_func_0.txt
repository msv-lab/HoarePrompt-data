The function processes an integer \( n \) representing the number of stamps, along with the indexes of the cities for each stamp. It constructs a graph where each city is a node and each stamp represents an edge connecting two nodes. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from any node in the graph to find and print all nodes that are directly or indirectly reachable from that starting node. If the input is valid, the function prints a list of all reachable nodes; otherwise, it does not return anything meaningful due to the lack of explicit error handling.
