Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs a graph using a dictionary (`nbr`) where each key is a city and the value is a list of cities it connects to. This is done correctly based on the input stamps.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: After constructing the graph, the program performs a BFS starting from any node in the set `cand`. BFS is chosen because it guarantees to find one of the shortest paths in an unweighted graph, and here it ensures that all nodes reachable from the starting node are discovered.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the sequence of nodes visited during the BFS traversal, which represents a valid route of the letter.

4. **Validation**: The problem description guarantees that the input corresponds to a valid route with no repeated cities, so the program does not need to handle invalid inputs explicitly. The BFS algorithm inherently ensures that no city is visited more than once.

5. **Completeness**: Since the BFS traversal starts from any node in the set `cand`, and `cand` contains at least one node, the program will always output a complete path for one of the possible routes.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the solution for finding one of the possible routes of the letter based on the provided stamps. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
