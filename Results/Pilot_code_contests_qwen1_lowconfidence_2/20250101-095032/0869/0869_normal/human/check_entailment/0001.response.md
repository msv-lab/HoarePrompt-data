Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the graph formed by the stamps has multiple connected components. Specifically, the program assumes that there is a single connected component and starts DFS from any vertex in the component. However, if there are multiple components, the program will not find a valid path across different components. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2
2 3
4 5
```

This input represents two separate connected components: {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5}. The program will only explore one of these components and not the other, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect for inputs involving multiple connected components.
