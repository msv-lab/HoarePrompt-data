The code adds `l[1]` to the set `cand`. Given the initial state, `cand` is an empty set `{}`, and `l[1]` is a string that is not already in `nbr`.

After executing `cand.add(l[1])`, the set `cand` will contain `l[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs {`l[0]`: [l[1]], `l[1]`: [l[0]]}, `cand` is a set with {l[1]}, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
