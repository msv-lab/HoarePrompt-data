`cand` is a set that was either `{l[1]}` with `l[0]` removed or an empty set `{}`, and the code removes `l[1]` from `cand`. Since `cand` is a set, removing an element that does not exist in the set (like `l[1]` which is already not present due to the previous operation) does not change the set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`; `cand` is an empty set `{}`.**
