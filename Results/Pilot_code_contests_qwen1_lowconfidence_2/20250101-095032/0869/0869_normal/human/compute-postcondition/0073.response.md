Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` is a list containing all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` (including `v` itself), and `Q` is a list containing all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` (including `v` itself).**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to add nodes to `marked`, `res`, and `Q` until there are no more unvisited neighbors of `v` in `nbr[v]`.
- Initially, `v` is marked and added to both `res` and `Q`.
- Each iteration of the loop adds an unmarked neighbor of `v` to `marked`, `res`, and `Q`.
- This process repeats until all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` have been added to `marked`, `res`, and `Q`.

Since the loop stops when there are no more unvisited neighbors, `nbr[v]` will eventually become an empty list, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `nbr[v]` is empty initially), the values of the variables remain as follows:
- `v` is still in `marked`.
- `res` and `Q` contain only `v` because no additional nodes are added.
