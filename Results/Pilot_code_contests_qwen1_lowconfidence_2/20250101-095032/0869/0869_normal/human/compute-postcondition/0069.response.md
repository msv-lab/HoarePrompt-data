`marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the `marked` set now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` (after the first element), `i` is not in `marked`, `res` now contains the element `i`, and `Q` now contains the element `i`; `marked` includes the value of `i`**
