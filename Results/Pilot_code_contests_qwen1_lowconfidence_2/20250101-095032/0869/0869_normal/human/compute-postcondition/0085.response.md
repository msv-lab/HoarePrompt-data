`Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Since `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`, appending `i` to `Q` increases the length of `Q` by one. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` now has at least 4 elements, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`, and `marked` now includes the node `i`.**
