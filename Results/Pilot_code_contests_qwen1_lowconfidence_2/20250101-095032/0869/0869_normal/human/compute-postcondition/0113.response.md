The code snippet prints the elements of the `res` list joined by spaces. However, the execution of the print statement itself does not change any variables. Therefore, the contents of `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of the original `cand`, `Q` is empty, `marked` contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from the original `v` including all nodes in `nbr[v]` and any other nodes reachable through them, `res` contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from the original `v` including all nodes in `nbr[v]` and any other nodes reachable through them.**
