Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary where if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `l[0]` is added as a key with a list containing `l[1]` as its value, and `cand` is updated to a set containing `l[1]`. If `l[0]` is already in `nbr`, `l[1]` is appended to the list corresponding to `l[0]` in `nbr`, and `cand` is an empty set `{}`. `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.***
