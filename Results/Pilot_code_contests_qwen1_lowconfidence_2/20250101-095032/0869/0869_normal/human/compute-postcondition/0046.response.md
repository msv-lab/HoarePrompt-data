Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\).
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes.
   - `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element).
   - `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `v` in the set `cand`.

3. **Break Condition:**
   - The loop breaks out if it encounters a break statement inside the loop or if the loop reaches the end of its iteration without breaking.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the last node that was processed in the set `cand`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `v` needs to be the next node in the set `cand`.
   - Since `cand` is a set, we cannot directly access the order of elements. However, the loop will proceed to the next element in the set.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - After processing `v`, the loop will move to the next element in the set `cand`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be the next element in the set `cand`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `nbr` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
- `cand` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.

However, `v` changes to the next element in the set `cand`.

**State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes, `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element), `v` is the next node in the set `cand`.**
