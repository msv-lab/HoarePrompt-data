The code `marked.add(i)` adds the variable `i` to the set `marked`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, so we will keep it as `i` in the output state. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` must have had at least 2 elements initially, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` is a list containing all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` (including `v` itself), the variable `i` is now in the set `marked`**
