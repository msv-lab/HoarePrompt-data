`res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The value of `i` is in `marked`, and the value of `v` is a valid index in `nbr` with at least one element. After appending `i` to `res`, the length of `res` increases by 1, but no other changes occur to the variables.

Output State: **`v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i` appended to it**
