`Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. The variable `i` is already present in `marked`, and the values of `v`, `nbr[v]`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new entry in `Q`.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains the element `i`, and `Q` contains the element `i`.**
