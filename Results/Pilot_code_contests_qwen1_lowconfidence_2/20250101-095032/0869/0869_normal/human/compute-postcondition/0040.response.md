Let's go through the steps:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `l[0]` is added as a key with a list containing `l[1]` as its value, and `cand` is updated to a set containing `l[1]`.
   - If `l[0]` is already in `nbr`, `l[1]` is appended to the list corresponding to `l[0]` in `nbr`, and `cand` is an empty set `{}`.
   - `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.

2. Code Execution:
   - The code `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` appends `l[0]` to the list in `nbr` that corresponds to `l[1]`.

3. After Execution:
   - Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `l[0]` and `l[1]`, we need to consider two scenarios:
     a) `l[0]` is not already in `nbr[l[1]]` (following the initial state conditions)
     b) `l[0]` is already in `nbr[l[1]]` (which would mean `l[0]` was previously added to `nbr[l[1]]`).

Given the initial state conditions, let's assume the first scenario since it is more general and covers the initial conditions.

- `nbr[l[1]]` will have `l[0]` appended to it.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `nbr` is updated such that the list corresponding to `l[1]` in `nbr` now includes `l[0]`
- `cand` remains an empty set `{}`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `nbr[l[1]]` contains `l[0]`; `cand` is an empty set `{}`**
