Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, either `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[1], l[0]]}`.
   - `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` or an empty set `{}`.
   - `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it will run `n` times if `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` (the loop variable) must be less than `n`.
   - Since the loop has not yet completed all its iterations, `i` must be less than `n` minus 1 (i.e., `i < n-1`).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as long as the loop can continue.
   - `i` increases by 1 after each iteration, so it becomes `i + 1`.
   - The dictionary `nbr` and the set `cand` do not change based on the loop itself; they depend on the loop body which is omitted but assumed to be modifying these structures in some way.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `nbr` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `cand` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `l` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `i` increases by 1 and we need `i` to be less than `n-1` for the loop to continue:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, either `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[1], l[0]]}`, `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` or an empty set {}, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
