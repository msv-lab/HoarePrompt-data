`Q` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is the third element of `nbr[v]`, and `marked` and `res` both contain the value of `i`, the value of `i` is added to `Q`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`v` remains the same, `nbr[v]` remains the same, `i` is the third element of `nbr[v]`, `marked` contains the value of `i`, `res` now contains the value of `i`, and `Q` contains `i` (if `i` was not already in `marked` before, otherwise `Q` remains the same).**
