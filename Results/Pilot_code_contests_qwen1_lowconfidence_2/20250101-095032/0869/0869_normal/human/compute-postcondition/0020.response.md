The code `l = raw_input().split()` takes user input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This affects the value of `l`, but the initial state of `n`, `nbr`, `cand`, and `l` is still valid. The updated value of `l` will be the list of strings derived from the user input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, either `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1]]}`, `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` or an empty set {}, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
