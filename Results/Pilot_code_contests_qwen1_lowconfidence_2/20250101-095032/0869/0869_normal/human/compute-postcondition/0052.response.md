`marked.add(v)` adds the value of `v` to the set `marked`. Since `v` is the last node in the set `cand`, the only change is that `marked` now contains this node. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes, `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element), `v` is the last node in the set `cand`, and `marked` is a set containing the node `v`.**
