`cand` is a set, and it removes `l[0]` from itself. The value of `nbr` can either be `{l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]()]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`, and `cand` can either be a set containing `{l[1]}` or an empty set `{}`. After removing `l[0]` from `cand`, if `l[0]` was in `cand`, it will no longer be there. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr` is either `{l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`, `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` with `l[0]` removed or an empty set `{}`, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
