`cand` is an empty set `{}`, and the code removes `l[1]` from `cand`. Since `cand` is initially empty, removing `l[1]` from an empty set does not change the set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {`l[1]`: [`l[1], `l[0]`]}, `cand` is an empty set {}, `l` is a list of strings derived from user input, and `l[1]` is in `nbr`.**
