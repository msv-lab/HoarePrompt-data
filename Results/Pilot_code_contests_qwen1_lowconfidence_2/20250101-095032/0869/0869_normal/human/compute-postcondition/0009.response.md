The code `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` appends the value of `l[1]` to the list associated with the key `l[0]` in the dictionary `nbr`. Given the initial state where `nbr` is an empty dictionary, this means that after executing the code, the dictionary `nbr` will contain one entry: `l[0]` maps to a list containing `l[1]`.

- The list `l` is derived from user input, so the values of its elements remain unchanged.
- The dictionary `nbr` now contains one entry: `l[0]` maps to a list containing `l[1]`.
- The set `cand` remains empty as it was not affected by the code.
- The list `l` is also not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with one entry {`l[0]`: [`l[1]`]}, `cand` is an empty set, `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
