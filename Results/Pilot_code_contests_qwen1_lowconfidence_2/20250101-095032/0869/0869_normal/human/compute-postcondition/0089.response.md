The code `res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The value of `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`. Since `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, appending `i` to `res` means that `res` now includes `i`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `v` is the last element of `Q`.
- `Q` now has at least 4 elements.
- `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition.
- `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`.
- `marked` now includes the node `i`.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` now has at least 4 elements, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself and `i`, `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`, `marked` now includes the node `i`.**
