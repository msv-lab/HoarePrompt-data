The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The initial values of `n` and `nbr` and the state of `cand` remain unchanged.

Since `raw_input().split()` requires user input, the exact values of the elements in `l` cannot be determined without actual input from the user. However, we know that `l` will be a list of strings derived from the user's input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `l` is a list of strings derived from user input**
