`marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. According to the initial state, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`. If `i` was not in `marked` initially, then adding `i` to `marked` means `i` is now in `marked` and `res` does not contain `i` and `Q` does not contain `i`. If `i` was already in `marked`, adding `i` again does not change its status.

Since the initial state specifies that if `i` is not in `marked`, `res` does not contain the element `i`, and `Q` does not contain the element `i`, and if `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains the element `i`, and `Q` contains the element `i`, the addition of `i` to `marked` will update these conditions accordingly.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`, if `i` was not in `marked` initially, then `i` is now in `marked`, `res` does not contain the element `i`, and `Q` does not contain the element `i`; if `i` was in `marked` initially, `res` contains the element `i`, and `Q` contains the element `i`.**
