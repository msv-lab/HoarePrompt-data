`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings based on whitespace. The initial values of `n`, `nbr`, and `cand` are not directly affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary where if `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, it is updated to `{l[1]: [l[0]]}`, and `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}`; otherwise, if `l[1]` is already in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`, and `cand` is an empty set `{}`; `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.**
