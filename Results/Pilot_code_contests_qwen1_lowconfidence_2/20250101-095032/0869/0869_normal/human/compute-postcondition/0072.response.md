Postcondition: ***`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` (after the first element), `i` is not in `marked`, `res` now contains the elements of its previous contents plus `i`, and `Q` now contains the elements of its previous contents plus `i`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described by the if part.***
