Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary updated according to the presence of `l[0]` in the original dictionary, and `cand` is updated accordingly.
     - If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr` is updated to `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`.
     - Otherwise, `nbr` is updated to either `{l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`, and `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` with `l[0]` removed or an empty set `{}`.
2. The code snippet to execute is:
   ```python
   nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])
   ```

3. Analyzing the code:
   - The code appends `l[0]` to the list associated with `l[1]` in the dictionary `nbr`.
   - This means that `nbr[l[1]]` will now contain the current elements plus `l[0]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `l[0]` was not in `nbr` before, `nbr` would be updated to `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`.
- If `l[0]` was already in `nbr`, the structure of `nbr` could be one of the two mentioned.

After executing `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])`:
- The list associated with `l[1]` in `nbr` will include `l[0]`.

Since the exact structure of `nbr` was not specified (whether `l[0]` was present or not), let's consider both scenarios:

### Scenario 1: `l[0]` was not in `nbr`
- Before: `nbr = {l[0]: [l[1]]}`
- After: `nbr = {l[0]: [l[1], l[0]]}`

### Scenario 2: `l[0]` was already in `nbr`
- Before: `nbr = {l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`
- After: `nbr = {l[0]: [l[1], l[1], l[0]], l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`
- Or
- Before: `nbr = {l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`
- After: `nbr = {l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1], l[0]]}`

Regardless of the scenario, `cand` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `cand`. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `nbr` is updated such that `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`; `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` with `l[0]` removed or an empty set `{}`.**
