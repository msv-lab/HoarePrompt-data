Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, either {`l[0]`: [l[1]], `l[1]`: [l[0]]} or {`l[1]`: [l[1], l[0]]}, `cand` is either a set containing {l[1]} or an empty set {}, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.***

This postcondition covers both cases:
- If `l[1] not in nbr`, then `nbr` will have the key-value pair {`l[0]`: [l[1]], `l[1]`: [l[0]]} and `cand` will be a set containing {l[1]}.
- If `l[1] in nbr`, then `nbr` will have the key-value pair {`l[1]`: [l[1], l[0]]} and `cand` will be an empty set {}.
