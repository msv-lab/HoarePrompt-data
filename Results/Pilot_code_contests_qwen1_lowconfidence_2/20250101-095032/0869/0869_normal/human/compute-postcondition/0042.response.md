Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[l[1]]` either contains `[l[0]]` (if `l[1]` was not previously a key) or is updated to include `l[0]` (if `l[1]` was already a key). `cand` is a set containing `{l[1]}` if `l[1]` was not previously a key, or remains an empty set `{}` if `l[1]` was already a key. `l` is the list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.***
