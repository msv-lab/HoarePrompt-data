The code appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` (including `v` itself). After appending `i` to `res`, `i` will be added to this list.

The output state is:
**`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` must have had at least 2 elements initially, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself and `i`, the variable `i` is now in the set `marked`**.
