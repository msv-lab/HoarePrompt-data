`res` is appended with the value of `i`, which is the second element of `nbr[v]`. The `marked` variable remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the second element of `nbr[v]`; `marked` contains the value of `i`; `res` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the second element of `nbr[v]`; `marked` contains the value of `i`; `res` now contains the value of `i`**
