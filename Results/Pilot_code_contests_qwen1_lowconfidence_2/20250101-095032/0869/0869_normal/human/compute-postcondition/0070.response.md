`res` appends the value of `i`. Since `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` (after the first element) and was added to both `res` and `Q`, the value of `res` changes to include `i` at its end. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` (after the first element), `i` is not in `marked`, `res` now contains the elements of its previous contents plus `i`, and `Q` now contains the element `i`; `marked` includes the value of `i`**
