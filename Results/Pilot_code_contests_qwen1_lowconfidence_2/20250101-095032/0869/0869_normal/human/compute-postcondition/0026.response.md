Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary updated according to the presence of `l[0]` in the original dictionary, and `cand` is updated accordingly.
     - If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr` is updated to `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`; otherwise, `nbr` is updated to either `{l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`, and `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` with `l[0]` removed or an empty set `{}`.
   - `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` such that the key `l[1]` points to the list `[l[0]]`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The variable `nbr` is updated to include the new key-value pair `{l[1]: [l[0]]}`.
   - The variables `n`, `cand`, and the structure of `nbr` related to `l[0]` and `l[1]` might change based on whether `l[0]` was already in `nbr` or not.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains greater than 1 (unchanged).
   - `nbr` is now updated to include `{l[1]: [l[0]]}`.
   - `cand` could be either `{l[1]}` if `l[0]` was previously in `nbr` and is now removed, or `{}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr`.

Given this analysis, the updated states are as follows:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is updated to include `{l[1]: [l[0]]}`, and `cand` is either `{l[1]}` if `l[0]` was previously in `nbr` and is now removed, or `{}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr`.**
