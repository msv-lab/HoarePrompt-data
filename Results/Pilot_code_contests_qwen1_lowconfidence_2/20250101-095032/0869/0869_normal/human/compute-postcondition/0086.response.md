Postcondition: ***`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` now has at least 4 elements, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`, and if `i` is not in `marked`, `marked` now includes the node `i`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
