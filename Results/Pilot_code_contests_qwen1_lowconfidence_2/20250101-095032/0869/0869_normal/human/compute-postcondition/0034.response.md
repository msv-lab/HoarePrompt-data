`cand` is a set where the value of `l[0]` is added. The initial state is that `n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary where `l[1]` is updated to include `l[0]` in its list, `cand` is an empty set `{}`, and `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace. After executing `cand.add(l[0])`, the value of `cand` changes to a set containing `l[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary where `l[1]` includes `l[0]` in its list, `cand` is a set containing `l[0]`, and `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.**
