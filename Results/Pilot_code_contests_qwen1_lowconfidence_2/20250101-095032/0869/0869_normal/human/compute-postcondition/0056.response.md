`v` is assigned the value of `Q.pop()`. Since `Q` contains the value of `v`, `v` will now be the last element popped from `Q`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes, `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element), `v` is the value previously contained in `Q`, `marked` is a set containing the node `v`, `res` is a list containing the value of `v`, `Q` is a list that no longer contains the value of `v`.
