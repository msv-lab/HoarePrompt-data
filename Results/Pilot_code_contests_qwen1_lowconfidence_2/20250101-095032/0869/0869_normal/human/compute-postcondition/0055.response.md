Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state of the program:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while len(Q) > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `len(Q) > 0` must be true. This means that the list `Q` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\).
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes.
- `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element).
- `v` is the last node in the set `cand`.
- `marked` is a set containing the node `v`.
- `res` is a list containing the value of `v`.
- `Q` is a list containing the value of `v`.

Since `Q` initially contains the value of `v`, we need to ensure that `Q` has at least one element for the loop to execute. In this case, `Q` already contains the value of `v`, so no adjustments are necessary for the state of `Q` to make the loop execute at least once.

Therefore, no state adjustments are required for the loop to execute one more time based on the given information.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes, `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element), `v` is the last node in the set `cand`, `marked` is a set containing the node `v`, `res` is a list containing the value of `v`, `Q` is a list containing the value of `v`**
