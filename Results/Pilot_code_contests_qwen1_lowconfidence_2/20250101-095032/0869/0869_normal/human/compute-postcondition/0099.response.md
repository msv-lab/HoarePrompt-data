`Q` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is in `marked`, and `res` contains the value of `i` appended to it. The state of `v` and `nbr[v]` remains unchanged since they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains the value of `i` appended to it, `Q` contains the value of `i` appended to it.**
