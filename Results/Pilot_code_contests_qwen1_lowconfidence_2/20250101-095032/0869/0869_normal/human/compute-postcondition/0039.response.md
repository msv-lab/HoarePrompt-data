`cand` is a set that gets the value `l[1]` added to it. Since `l` is obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace, the exact value of `l[1]` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that `cand` is initially empty. Therefore, after executing `cand.add(l[1])`, `cand` will contain the element `l[1]`.

The values of `n`, `nbr`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `cand` is a set containing `{l[1]}`, and `l` is the list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.**
