The code `cand.add(l[1])` adds the element `l[1]` to the set `cand`. Since `cand` was previously either `{l[1]}` if `l[0]` was in `nbr` and is now removed, or `{}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr`, adding `l[1]` will change the state of `cand` to `{l[1]}` regardless of its previous state.

- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `nbr` remains unchanged: `{l[1]: [l[0]]}`.
- `cand` changes to `{l[1]}`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is {l[1]: [l[0]]}, `cand` is {l[1]}**
