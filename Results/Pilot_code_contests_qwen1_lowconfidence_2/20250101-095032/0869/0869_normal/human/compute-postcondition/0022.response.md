`cand` adds the element `l[0]` to the set. Since `cand` was initially either a set containing `{l[1]}` or an empty set `{}`, adding `l[0]` will change its state. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, `nbr` remains unchanged, and `l` remains the list of strings derived from user input.

- If `cand` was initially `{l[1]}`, after adding `l[0]`, `cand` becomes `{l[1], l[0]}`.
- If `cand` was initially `{}`, after adding `l[0]`, `cand` becomes `{l[0]}`.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair updated to `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`
- `cand` is now a set containing `{l[0], l[1]}` or `{l[0]}` depending on its initial state
- `l` is a list of strings derived from user input

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair updated to {`l[0]`: [`l[1]`]}, `cand` is either a set containing {`l[0], l[1]`} or {`l[0]`}, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
