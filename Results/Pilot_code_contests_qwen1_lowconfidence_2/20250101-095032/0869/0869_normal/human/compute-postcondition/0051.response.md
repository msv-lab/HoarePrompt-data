`marked` is assigned a new set, which replaces the existing value of `marked`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `nbr`, `cand`, and `v`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes, `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element), `v` is the last node in the set `cand`, and `marked` is a new empty set.**
