Postcondition: ***`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is either in `marked` or not. If `i` is not in `marked`, `res` does not contain the element `i`, and `Q` does not contain the element `i`. If `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains the element `i`, and `Q` contains the element `i`.***
