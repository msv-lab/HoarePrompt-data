`res` appends the value of `i`. Based on the initial state, if `i` was not in `marked` initially, then `i` is now in `marked`, `res` does not contain the element `i`, and `Q` does not contain the element `i`. After appending `i` to `res`, `res` will now contain `i`. If `i` was already in `marked` initially, the states of `marked`, `res`, and `Q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`, if `i` was not in `marked` initially, then `i` is now in `marked`, `res` now contains the element `i`, and `Q` does not contain the element `i`; if `i` was in `marked` initially, `res` contains the element `i`, and `Q` contains the element `i`.**
