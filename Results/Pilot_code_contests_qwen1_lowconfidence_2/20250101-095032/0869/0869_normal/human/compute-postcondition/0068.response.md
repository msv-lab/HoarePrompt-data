According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `nbr[v]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `nbr[v]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:

- `v` is a node in `marked`
- `nbr[v]` is not an empty list
- `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`
- `i` is now in `marked`
- `res` now contains the element `i`
- `Q` now contains the element `i`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `nbr[v]`, and it must not already be in `marked`. Since `i` was the first element and is now in `marked`, the next element in `nbr[v]` will be the next value of `i`.

State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` (after the first element), `i` is not in `marked`, `res` now contains the element `i`, and `Q` now contains the element `i`.**
