Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `l[0]` is added as a key with a list containing `l[1]` as its value, and `cand` is updated to a set containing `l[1]`. If `l[0]` is already in `nbr`, `l[1]` is appended to the list corresponding to `l[0]` in `nbr`, and `cand` is an empty set `{}`.
   - `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - This line sets the value of `nbr[l[1]]` to `[l[0]]`.
   - Since `l[1]` is now used as a key, the value at `nbr[l[1]]` will be a list containing only `l[0]`.
   - The conditions mentioned in the initial state about `nbr` and `cand` are not directly affected by this line. However, they should still hold true unless there is additional code that changes them.

4. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `nbr[l[1]]` is now `[l[0]]`.
   - `n`, `cand`, and `l` remain unchanged unless modified by subsequent code (which is not present here).

5. **Output State**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[1]` having the value `[l[0]]`.
   - `cand` is still an empty set `{}`.
   - `l` remains unchanged from its original value after being split from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `cand` is a set `{}`, and `l` is the list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.**
