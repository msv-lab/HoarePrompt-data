`v` is assigned the value popped from the stack `Q`. The exact value of `v` depends on what is popped from `Q`, but the stack `Q` will lose the top element. Therefore, the output state is: `v` is the value popped from `Q`; `Q` is the stack with its top element removed.

Output State: **`v` is the value popped from `Q`; `Q` is the stack with its top element removed.**
