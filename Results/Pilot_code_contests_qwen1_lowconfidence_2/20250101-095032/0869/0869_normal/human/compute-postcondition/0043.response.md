Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes, `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary, and `l` is the list of strings derived from user input.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\). Initially, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, and `cand` is an empty set.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - A line of input is read and split into `l`.
     - If `l[0]` is not already a key in `nbr`:
       - Add `l[0]` as a key in `nbr` with the value `[l[1]]`.
       - Add `l[0]` to `cand`.
     - If `l[0]` is already a key in `nbr`:
       - Append `l[1]` to `nbr[l[0]]`.
       - Remove `l[0]` from `cand`.
     - If `l[1]` is not already a key in `nbr`:
       - Add `l[1]` as a key in `nbr` with the value `[l[0]]`.
       - Add `l[1]` to `cand`.
     - If `l[1]` is already a key in `nbr`:
       - Append `l[0]` to `nbr[l[1]]`.
       - Remove `l[1]` from `cand`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `nbr` will be a dictionary where each key represents a node, and the value is a list of nodes directly connected to it.
   - `cand` will be a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary during the process. This means every node mentioned in the input will be in `cand`.
   - `l` will always be the last list of strings derived from the user input.

This final state describes the complete structure of the graph represented by `nbr` and the set of all unique nodes involved in the construction of this graph.
