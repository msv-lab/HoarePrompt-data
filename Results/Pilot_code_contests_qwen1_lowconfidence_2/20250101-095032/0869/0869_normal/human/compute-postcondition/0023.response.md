The initial state indicates that `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, which is either `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1]]}`, `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` or an empty set `{}`, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input. The code snippet appends `l[1]` to the list associated with `l[0]` in the dictionary `nbr`.

Since `nbr` initially contains one key-value pair, appending `l[1]` to the list associated with `l[0]` means:

- If `nbr` is `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}`, after the operation, it will become `{l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` (note that `l[1]` is appended to the list of `l[0]`).
- If `nbr` is `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1]]}`, after the operation, it will become `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}` (again, `l[1]` is appended to the list of `l[1]`).

The other variables `cand` and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr` is either `{l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`, `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` or an empty set `{}`, and `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
