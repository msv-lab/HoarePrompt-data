`res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Since `i` is the third element of `nbr[v]`, `res` now includes this value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` remains the same, `nbr[v]` remains the same, `i` is the third element of `nbr[v]`, `marked` contains the value of `i`, `res` now contains the value of `i`, and `Q` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `marked` before.**
