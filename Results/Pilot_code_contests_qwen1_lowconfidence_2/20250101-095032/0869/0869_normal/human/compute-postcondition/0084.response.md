The code `res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Given that `res` originally contained all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, appending `i` (which is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`) to `res` means `res` now includes this new node.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:
- `v` is the last element of `Q`, 
- `Q` now has at least 3 elements,
- `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition,
- `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, and the newly appended node `i`,
- `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`,
- `marked` now includes the node `i`.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` now has at least 3 elements, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself and `i`, `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`, and `marked` now includes the node `i`.**
