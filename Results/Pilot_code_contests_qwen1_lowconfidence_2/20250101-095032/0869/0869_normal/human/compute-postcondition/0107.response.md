The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Given the initial state, the following changes occur:

- `v` remains the same because it is an index into `nbr` and does not change within the loop.
- `nbr[v]` remains the same because the structure of `nbr` does not change within the loop.
- `i` is set to the third element of `nbr[v]`.
- If the third element (`i`) is not in `marked`, then `res` and `Q` should both contain this new value of `i`. Otherwise, `res`, `Q`, and `marked` remain unchanged.

Since `i` is now set to the third element of `nbr[v]`, and `marked.add(i)` is executed, the value of `i` is added to the set `marked`.

Output State: **`v` remains the same, `nbr[v]` remains the same, `i` is the third element of `nbr[v]`, `marked` contains the value of `i`, and `res` and `Q` contain `i` if `i` was not already in `marked` before.**
