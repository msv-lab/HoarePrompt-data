The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. This means that the node `i` is marked as visited. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` now has at least 3 elements, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`, and `marked` now includes the node `i`.**
