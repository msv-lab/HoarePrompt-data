`cand.add(l[0])` adds the value of `l[0]` to the set `cand`. Since `cand` was initially an empty set, after adding `l[0]`, `cand` now contains the single element `l[0]`.

The value of `n` and the structure of `nbr` remain unchanged. The value of `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`. The value of `l` remains as a list of strings derived from user input, and its first element (`l[0]`) is now a key in `nbr`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {`l[0]`: [`l[1]`]}, `cand` is a set containing the element `l[0]`, `l` is a list of strings derived from user input**
