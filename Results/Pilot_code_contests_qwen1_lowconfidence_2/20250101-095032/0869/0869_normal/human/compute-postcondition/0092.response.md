Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` now has a length of `length(Q) + k` where `k` is the number of nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` excluding `v` itself, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, and `marked` is a set containing all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself.**
