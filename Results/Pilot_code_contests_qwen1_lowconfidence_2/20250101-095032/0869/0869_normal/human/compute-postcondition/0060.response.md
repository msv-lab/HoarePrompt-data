`res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The value of `i` is in `marked`, and the values of `v`, `nbr[v]`, and `marked` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is in `marked`, and `res` now contains the element `i`.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains the element `i`**
