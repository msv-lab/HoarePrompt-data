To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can iterate over the elements in `nbr[v]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `v`:**
   - `v` is the value previously contained in `Q`.
   - Since `Q` is initially an empty list, there's no initial value for `v` based on the given information. However, `v` must be one of the nodes present in the set `marked`.

2. **Dictionary `nbr`:**
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes.
   - For the loop `for i in nbr[v]:` to execute, `v` must exist as a key in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must have at least one element (i.e., at least one connected node).

3. **Set `marked`:**
   - `marked` is a set containing the node `v`.
   - Therefore, `v` must be in `marked`.

4. **List `Q`:**
   - `Q` is an empty list.
   - The value of `v` is not directly influenced by `Q` being empty.

Given these points, the loop will only execute if:
- `v` is a valid node in `nbr`.
- `nbr[v]` is not an empty list (i.e., it contains at least one connected node).

### Adjusted States:

- Ensure `v` is a valid node in `nbr` and exists in `marked`.
- Ensure `nbr[v]` is not empty.

### Final Answer:

State: **`v` is a node in `marked` and `nbr[v]` is not an empty list**
