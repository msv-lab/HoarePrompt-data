The code appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Based on the initial conditions:

- `v` is a node in `marked`.
- `nbr[v]` is not an empty list.
- `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`.
- If `i` was not in `marked` initially, then `i` is now in `marked`, `res` now contains the element `i`, and `Q` does not contain the element `i`.
- If `i` was in `marked` initially, `res` contains the element `i`, and `Q` contains the element `i`.

After executing `Q.append(i)`, the value of `Q` will be updated to include `i`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`, if `i` was not in `marked` initially, then `i` is now in `marked`, `res` now contains the element `i`, and `Q` now contains the element `i`, otherwise `res` contains the element `i` and `Q` contains the element `i`.**
