According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variables `nbr` and `cand` being dictionaries and sets respectively, do not affect the loop's execution condition. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range of 1 to \(10^5\).
- `nbr` is an empty dictionary.
- `cand` is an empty set.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set**
