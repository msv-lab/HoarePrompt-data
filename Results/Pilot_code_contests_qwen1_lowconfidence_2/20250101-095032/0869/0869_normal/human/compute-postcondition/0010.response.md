The code `cand.remove(l[0])` attempts to remove the element `l[0]` from the set `cand`. However, since `cand` is an empty set (`cand` is an empty set), removing an element from it will raise a `KeyError`. But before considering this error, let's follow the steps:

1. Initially, `cand` is an empty set `{}`.
2. `l[0]` is an element derived from user input, but its specific value is not provided.
3. The code tries to remove `l[0]` from `cand`.

Since `cand` is empty, attempting to remove any element from it would lead to a `KeyError`. However, following the instructions to describe the state without considering the exception handling, we will update the state based on the attempted operation.

- `cand` remains an empty set `{}` because the removal attempt did not succeed.
- `l` remains unchanged, containing the list of strings derived from user input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with one entry {`l[0]`: [`l[1]`]}, `cand` is an empty set `{}`, `l` is a list of strings derived from user input.**
