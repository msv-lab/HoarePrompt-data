`marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Since `i` was not previously in `marked`, it is now added to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is in `marked`.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is in `marked`**
