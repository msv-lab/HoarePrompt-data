The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. The value of `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`. Therefore, the updated list `Q` will include the last element of `Q` (which is `v`), followed by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q`, `Q` is now `[...v, i]`, `nbr[v]` is a list of all nodes directly connected to `v` without repetition, `res` now contains all nodes directly or indirectly reachable from `v` including `v` itself, `i` is the next unmarked node in `nbr[v]`, `marked` now includes the node `i`**
