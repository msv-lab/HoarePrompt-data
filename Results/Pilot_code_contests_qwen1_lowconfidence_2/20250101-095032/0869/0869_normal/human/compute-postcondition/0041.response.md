`cand` is an empty set `{}`, and the code removes `l[1]` from `cand`. Since `cand` is initially empty, removing `l[1]` from an empty set does not change the set. The value of `n` and `nbr[l[1]]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `nbr[l[1]]` contains `l[0]`; `cand` is an empty set `{}`**
