The code initializes an empty dictionary named `nbr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is an integer input by the user within the range of 1 to \(10^5\) and `nbr` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range of 1 to \(10^5\); `nbr` is an empty dictionary**
