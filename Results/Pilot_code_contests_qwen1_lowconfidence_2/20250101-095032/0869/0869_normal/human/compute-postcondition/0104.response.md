`Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Since `i` is the second element of `nbr[v]`, it is added to `Q`. The values of `v`, `nbr`, `marked`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the second element of `nbr[v]`; `marked` contains the value of `i`; `res` now contains the value of `i`; `Q` contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the second element of `nbr[v]`; `marked` contains the value of `i`; `res` now contains the value of `i`; `Q` contains the value of `i`.**
