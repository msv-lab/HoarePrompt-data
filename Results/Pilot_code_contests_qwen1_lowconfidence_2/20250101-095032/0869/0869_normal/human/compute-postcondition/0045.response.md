The code `break` does not affect any variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or the innermost loop or if statement we are inside. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^5\), `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of connected nodes, `cand` is a set containing all unique nodes that were added to the dictionary (must contain at least one element), and `l` is the list of strings derived from user input. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
