Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `nbr` is a dictionary updated according to the presence of `l[0]` in the original dictionary, and `cand` is updated accordingly. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr` is updated to {`l[0]`: [`l[1]`]}; otherwise, `nbr` is updated to either `{l[0]: [l[1], l[1]], l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}` or `{l[1]: [l[0], l[1], l[1]]}`, and `cand` is either a set containing `{l[1]}` with `l[0]` removed or an empty set `{}`.***
