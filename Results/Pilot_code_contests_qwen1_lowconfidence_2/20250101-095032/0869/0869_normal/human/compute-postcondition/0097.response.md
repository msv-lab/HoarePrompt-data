`i` is added to the set `marked`. The state of `v` and `nbr` remains unchanged since no operations were performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked`.

Output State: **`v` is a valid index in `nbr`, and `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked`**
