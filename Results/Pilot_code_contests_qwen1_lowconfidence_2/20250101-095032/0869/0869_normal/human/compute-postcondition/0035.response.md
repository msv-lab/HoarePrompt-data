Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where if `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, it is updated to `{l[1]: [l[0]]}`, and `cand` is updated to `{l[1]}`; otherwise, if `l[1]` is already in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`, and `cand` is an empty set `{}`.
   - `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code updates the dictionary `nbr` by appending `l[1]` to the list `nbr[l[0]]`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - From the initial state, we know that `l` is a list obtained from splitting an input string by whitespace, and thus `l[0]` and `l[1]` are valid indices.
   - Since `l[1]` might or might not already exist in `nbr`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` would initially be an empty list, and now `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` adds `l[1]` to this list.
     - If `l[1]` is already in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` contains some elements (possibly including `l[0]`), and now `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` adds `l[1]` to the existing list.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `cand` remains an empty set `{}`.
   - `nbr` is updated such that `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]`. This means if `l[1]` was not previously in `nbr`, it now has the key `l[1]` with its value being a list containing `l[0]`. If `l[1]` was already in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `l[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `cand` is an empty set {}, `nbr` is updated such that `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])`.**
