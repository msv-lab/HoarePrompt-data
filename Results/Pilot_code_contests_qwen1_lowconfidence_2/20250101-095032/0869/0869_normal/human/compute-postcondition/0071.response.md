The code appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Since `i` is not already in `Q`, the new state of `Q` will include all its previous elements plus `i`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` (after the first element), `i` is not in `marked`, `res` now contains the elements of its previous contents plus `i`, and `Q` now contains the element `i`; `marked` includes the value of `i`.
2. The code `Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`.

Since `i` is already in `Q`, appending it again does not change the content of `Q`. However, the list `Q` will still contain all its previous elements.

Output State: **`v` is a node in `marked`, `nbr[v]` is not an empty list, `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` (after the first element), `i` is not in `marked`, `res` now contains the elements of its previous contents plus `i`, and `Q` now contains the elements of its previous contents plus `i`.**
