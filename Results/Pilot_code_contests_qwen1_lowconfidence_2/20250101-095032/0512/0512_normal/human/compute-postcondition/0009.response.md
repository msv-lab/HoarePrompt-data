`dp[ai]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, so `dp[ai]` means `dp[a[2]]` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `dp[a[2]]` is `True`**
