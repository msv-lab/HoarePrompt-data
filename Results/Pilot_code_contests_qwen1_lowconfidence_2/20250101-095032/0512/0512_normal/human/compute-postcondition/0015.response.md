Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   The loop condition is `for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):`. This means the loop starts from `max(a) + 1` and goes up to `k`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `dp[i + 1]` is set to `any(not dp[(i + 1) - ai] for ai in a)`.
   - `dp[i]` is set to `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` would be the current value of `i` plus 1.

4. **Update the States**:
   - For `dp[i + 1]`: According to the given formula, it will be updated based on the values of `dp` for indices `(i + 1) - ai` where `ai` is an element of `a`.
   - For `dp[i]`: According to the given formula, it will be updated based on the values of `dp` for indices `i - ai` where `ai` is an element of `a`.

5. **Next Iteration Conditions**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[max(a) + 1, k]`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `current_i + 1`.

### Updated States:
- The next value of `i` will be `current_i + 1`.
- We need to update `dp[current_i + 2]` and `dp[current_i + 1]` according to the formulas provided.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dp[i + 1]` is set to `any(not dp[(i + 1) - ai] for ai in a)`.
- `dp[i]` is set to `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `current_i + 1`.
- `dp[i + 1]` (which becomes `dp[(current_i + 1) + 1] = dp[current_i + 2]`) will be updated based on the previous values.
- `dp[i]` (which becomes `dp[current_i + 1]`) will be updated based on the previous values.

### Final State:
- The next value of `i` will be `current_i + 1`.
- The new state will be such that `dp[i + 1]` and `dp[i]` are updated according to the formulas provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`dp[current_i + 2]` is set to `any(not dp[(current_i + 2) - ai] for ai in a)`, `dp[current_i + 1]` is set to `any(not dp[current_i + 1 - ai] for ai in a)`**
