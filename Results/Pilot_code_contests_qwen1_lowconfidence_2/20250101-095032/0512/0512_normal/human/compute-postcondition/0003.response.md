The code initializes a list `dp` with `False` values, with a length of `k + 1`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `K`, `a`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `dp` list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and split into individual elements, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values.**
