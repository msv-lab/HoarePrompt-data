`n, k` are assigned the values from the input split and mapped to integers. The input is read using `BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, which means `input` is now treated as a byte stream. The values of `N` and `K` are replaced by the new values read from the input. The list `a` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers representing the set A where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K; `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input.**
