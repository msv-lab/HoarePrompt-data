`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`. This means for each `ai` in `a`, `dp[i - ai]` is checked, and if any of these checks result in `False`, `dp[i]` will be `True`. The value of `dp[i + 1]` is already determined by the previous line of code, so it remains unchanged. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1]` is set to `any(not dp[(i + 1) - ai] for ai in a)`, `dp[i]` is set to `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`**
