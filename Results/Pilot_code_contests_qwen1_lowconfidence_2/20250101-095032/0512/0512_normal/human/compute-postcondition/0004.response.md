Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial value:**
   - The loop variable is `ai`, which iterates over the list `a`.
   - Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and split into individual elements.

2. **Determine the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs for each element in the list `a`.

3. **Identify the initial state of `ai`:**
   - Since `ai` is the current element being processed in the loop, we need to determine what the initial value of `ai` is when the loop starts.
   - `ai` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration of the loop.

4. **List the necessary adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty, otherwise, the loop will not execute.
   - We need to specify the initial value of `ai` as the first element of the list `a`.

Given this information, we can formulate the required state adjustments:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`**
