Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\)
   - `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\)
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input
   - `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values
   - `ai` is the second element of the list `a`
   - `dp[ai]` is `True`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for ai in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` was the second element of the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list `a` must be considered.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `ai` is the second element of the list `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in the list `a` (the third element) will be the value of `ai` for the next iteration.
   - All other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are specified, they stay the same.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `N` remains as it is: \(1 \leq N \leq 100\)
   - `K` remains as it is: \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\)
   - `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, but now `ai` is the third element of the list `a`.
   - `n` and `k` remain the same as they were read from input.
   - `dp` remains a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values.
   - `dp[ai]` will be updated within the loop body, but we don't know its exact state until the loop body runs.

Given the above analysis, the state to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`**.
