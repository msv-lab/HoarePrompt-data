The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i - ai]` for each `ai` in `a`. However, the initial values of `dp[current_i + 2]` and `dp[current_i + 1]` are not directly used in the updated equation for `dp[i]`. The impact of the code on the program is to assign a new value to `dp[i]` based on the given condition.

Since the initial state values of `dp[current_i + 2]` and `dp[current_i + 1]` are not used in the calculation of `dp[i]`, they remain unchanged. The only updated variable is `dp[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dp[current_i + 2]` is set to `any(not dp[(current_i + 2) - ai] for ai in a)`, `dp[current_i + 1]` is set to `any(not dp[current_i + 1 - ai] for ai in a)`, `dp[i]` is set to `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`**
