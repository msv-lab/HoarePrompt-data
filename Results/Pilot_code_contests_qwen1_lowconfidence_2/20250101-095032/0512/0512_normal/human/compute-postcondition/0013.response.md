Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is given by: `dp[i]` is set to `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)`, where `a` is a list of integers and `i` is an index within the bounds of `dp`.
- The for loop is defined as: `for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):`

### Understanding the Loop Condition
The loop starts from `max(a) + 1` and goes up to `k + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

### Previous Iteration Details
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `dp[i]` is determined based on the values of `dp[i - ai]` for all `ai` in `a`.
- `i` was some value such that `i < k + 1`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy the condition `i <= k`.

Since `i` was incremented from the previous iteration and the loop condition is `i < k + 1`, the next value of `i` should be one more than the previous value of `i`.

### Adjusting States
- `dp[i]` needs to be recalculated for the new value of `i`.
- The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The condition `i < k + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Final State
- The new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
- `dp[i + 1]` will be set to `any(not dp[(i + 1) - ai] for ai in a)`.

### Conclusion
The state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`dp[i + 1]` is set to `any(not dp[(i + 1) - ai] for ai in a)`**, where `a` is a list of integers and `i + 1` is an index within the bounds of `dp`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`dp[i + 1]` is set to `any(not dp[(i + 1) - ai] for ai in a)`**
