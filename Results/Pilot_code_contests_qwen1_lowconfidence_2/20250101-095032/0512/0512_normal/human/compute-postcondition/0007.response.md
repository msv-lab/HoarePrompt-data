`dp[ai]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `ai` is the second element of the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `dp[ai]` is `True`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `dp[ai]` is `True`**
