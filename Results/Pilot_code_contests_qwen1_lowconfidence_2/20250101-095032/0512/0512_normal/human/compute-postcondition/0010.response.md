Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states to determine the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\).
  - `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\).
  - `a` is a list of integers.
  - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
  - `k` is the second integer read from the input.
  - `dp` is a list of length `k + 1` filled with `False` values.
  
- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for ai in a:
      dp[ai] = True
  ```

### Understanding the Loop:
- The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a` and sets `dp[ai]` to `True`.

### Output States for the First Few Iterations:
- After 1 iteration:
  - `ai` is the first element of the list `a`.
  - `dp[ai]` is `True`.
- After 2 iterations:
  - `ai` is the second element of the list `a`.
  - `dp[ai]` is `True`.
- After 3 iterations:
  - `ai` is the third element of the list `a`.
  - `dp[a[2]]` is `True`.

### Generalization:
- After `m` iterations (where `m` is the number of elements in the list `a`), `dp[ai]` will be `True` for each `ai` in `a`.

### Final State Analysis:
- If the list `a` is non-empty, the loop will set `dp[ai]` to `True` for each element `ai` in `a`.
- Therefore, `dp` will have `True` values at indices corresponding to the elements in `a`.

### Conclusion:
- If the list `a` is empty, the loop will not execute at all, and `dp` will remain a list of `False` values of length `k + 1`.
- If the list `a` is non-empty, `dp` will have `True` values at indices corresponding to the elements in `a`.

### Output State:
```plaintext
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, a is a non-empty list of integers, n is the first integer read from the input, k is the second integer read from the input, dp is a list of length k + 1, dp[ai] is True for each ai in a.**
```

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, considering both cases where the loop does not execute (empty list) and where it does execute (non-empty list).
