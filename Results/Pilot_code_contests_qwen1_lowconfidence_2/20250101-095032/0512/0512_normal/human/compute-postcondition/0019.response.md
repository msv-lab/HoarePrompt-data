The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The list `a` represents the set A where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K, and N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5.

The output cases are not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so we can only describe the input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `a` of integers representing the set A with specific constraints on N and K.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers representing the set A where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K, and N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5.**
