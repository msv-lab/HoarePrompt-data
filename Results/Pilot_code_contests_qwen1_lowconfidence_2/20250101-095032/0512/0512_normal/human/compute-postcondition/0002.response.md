`a` is assigned the value of a list of integers read from the input and split into individual elements. The input consists of `n` space-separated integers. The values of `N`, `K`, `n`, `k`, and the initial state of `a` (as a list of integers representing the set A where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K) are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `K` is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and split into individual elements, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input.**
