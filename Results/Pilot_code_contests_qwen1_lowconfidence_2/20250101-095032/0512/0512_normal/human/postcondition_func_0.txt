The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing a set A where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K, with constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5. It constructs a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length `k + 1` initialized to `False`. It then marks the positions in `dp` corresponding to elements in `a` as `True`. After that, it fills the rest of the `dp` array based on the subset sum problem, determining whether each value up to `k` can be formed using the elements in `a`. Finally, it writes 'First' to standard output if `dp[k]` is `True`, indicating that the value `k` can be formed, otherwise it writes 'Second'. Potential edge cases include when `a` contains all values from 1 to K, in which case `dp[k]` will always be `True`. If `k` is less than the maximum element in `a`, `dp[k]` will remain `False`. The function does not handle cases where the input constraints are violated.
