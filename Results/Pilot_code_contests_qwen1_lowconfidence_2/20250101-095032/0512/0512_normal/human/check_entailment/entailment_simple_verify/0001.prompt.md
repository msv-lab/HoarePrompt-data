You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a set A = \\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N \\} consisting of N positive integers. Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

Initially, we have a pile consisting of K stones. The two players perform the following operation alternately, starting from Taro:

* Choose an element x in A, and remove exactly x stones from the pile.



A player loses when he becomes unable to play. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \leq K

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N


Output

If Taro will win, print `First`; if Jiro will win, print `Second`.

Program:

def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of stones \(K\) is less than the smallest element in set \(A\). In such cases, the first player (Taro) would immediately lose because they cannot make a valid move. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1
1
```
In this case, the initial number of stones is 1, and the only element in set \(A\) is also 1. According to the problem description, Taro (the first player) should lose because he cannot make a valid move. However, the current program incorrectly outputs `First`.

To fix this, the program should check if \(K\) is less than the smallest element in \(A\) before proceeding with the dynamic programming approach. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import os
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    # Check if K is less than the smallest element in A
    if k < a[0]:
        os.write(1, 'Second'.encode())
        return
    
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in range(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the edge case correctly and outputs the right result for all potential inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import os
from io import BytesIO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of integers representing the set A where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K.
def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5, a is a non-empty list of integers, n is the first integer read from the input, k is the second integer read from the input, dp is a list of length k + 1, dp[ai] is True for each ai in a.
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp[i]` is set to `any(not dp[i - ai] for ai in a)` for all valid indices `i` in the range `[max(a) + 1, k]`, `a` is the list of integers, and `dp` is a list of length `k + 1`.
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
