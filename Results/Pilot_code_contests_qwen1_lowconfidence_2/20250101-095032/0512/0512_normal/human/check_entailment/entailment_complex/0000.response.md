Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads the input values \( N \), \( K \), and the list \( A \) correctly.
   - The input handling is done via `BytesIO` and splitting the input, which adheres to the expected format.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - A DP array `dp` is initialized to `False` for all values from 0 to \( K \).
   - Positions in `dp` corresponding to elements in \( A \) are marked as `True`.

3. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - The program iterates through the range from `max(A) + 1` to \( K \) and fills the `dp` array based on whether the current value can be formed using elements from \( A \).
   - This ensures that `dp[i]` is `True` if there exists a combination of elements from \( A \) that sum up to `i`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks the final value `dp[K]` and outputs 'First' if it is `True`, indicating Taro wins, or 'Second' if it is `False`, indicating Jiro wins.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the maximum element in \( A \) is larger than \( K \) or where \( K \) is smaller than the maximum element in \( A \).

6. **Constraints Adherence**:
   - The program adheres to the constraints \( 1 \leq N \leq 100 \), \( 1 \leq K \leq 10^5 \), and \( 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \leq K \).

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
