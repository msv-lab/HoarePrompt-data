Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `N` and `K` from the input, which are used to initialize the game parameters.
   - It then reads the list `a` of integers representing the set A.
   - The program uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to determine the winner.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - A DP table `dp` of length `k + 1` is initialized with all `False` values.
   - For each element `ai` in the list `a`, `dp[ai]` is set to `True`. This indicates that the current player can force a win if there are exactly `ai` stones left.

3. **DP Table Filling**:
   - The program iterates over the range from `max(a) + 1` to `k + 1`.
   - For each index `i`, `dp[i]` is set to `True` if there exists any `ai` in `a` such that `dp[i - ai]` is `False`. This means the current player can make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The final value of `dp[k]` determines the winner:
     - If `dp[k]` is `True`, Taro (the first player) wins.
     - If `dp[k]` is `False`, Jiro (the second player) wins.

The program follows the problem constraints and handles all the cases as specified:
- The program assumes valid inputs as per the problem constraints.
- It correctly identifies the winning strategy using the DP approach.
- The output is formatted as required (`First` or `Second`).

Since the program accurately implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given constraints and examples, it is correct according to the problem description.
