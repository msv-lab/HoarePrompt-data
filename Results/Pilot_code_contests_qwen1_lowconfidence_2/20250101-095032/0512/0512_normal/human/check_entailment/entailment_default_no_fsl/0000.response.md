Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the winner of the game for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where the set \(A\) contains all integers from 1 to \(K\). In such a scenario, the first player (Taro) would always lose because they cannot make a move that leaves the second player (Jiro) without a valid move. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 100000
1
```
In this case, the only move Taro can make is to remove 1 stone, leaving 99999 stones. No matter how many stones Jiro removes (1 stone), Taro will always be able to mirror Jiro's move, ensuring that Jiro will eventually be forced into a losing position. However, the provided code incorrectly outputs "First" in this case, indicating that Taro will win.

To correctly handle this case, the code should recognize that if the set \(A\) includes all integers from 1 up to \(K\), the first player will always lose. This can be checked by verifying if the maximum element in \(A\) is equal to \(K\). If it is, the first player will always lose regardless of their initial move.
