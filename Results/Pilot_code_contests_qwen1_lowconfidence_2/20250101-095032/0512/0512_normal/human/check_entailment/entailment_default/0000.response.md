Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code determines whether a given number `k` can be expressed as a sum of elements from the set `a`, rather than simulating the game and determining the winner based on optimal play.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game and use the Sprague-Grundy theorem or Nim-sum strategy to determine the winner. The current implementation does not alternate between players and does not account for the game state and optimal moves.

For example, consider the following case:
- **Input**:  
  ```
  2 5
  2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output**:  
  ```
  Second
  ```

- **Actual Output**:  
  The provided code would incorrectly determine that Taro can always win because it checks if `k` can be formed by the elements in `a`, which is not the correct approach for this game.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
