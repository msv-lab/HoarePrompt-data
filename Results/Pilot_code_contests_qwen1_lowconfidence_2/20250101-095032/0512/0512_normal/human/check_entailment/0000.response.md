Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the initial number of stones `K` is less than the smallest element in set `A`. In such a case, the first player (Taro) cannot make a move and thus loses the game. However, the current implementation of the dynamic programming approach does not account for this scenario.

To fix this, you need to add a check at the beginning of the function to see if `K` is less than the smallest element in `A`. Here is an example of how the program should handle this case:

```python
import os
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    # Check if K is less than the smallest element in A
    if k < a[0]:
        os.write(1, b'Second')
        return
    
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in range(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    
    os.write(1, b'First' if dp[k] else b'Second')

func()
```

With this addition, the program will correctly handle the case where `K` is less than the smallest element in `A`, ensuring that the program works for all potential cases described in the problem.
