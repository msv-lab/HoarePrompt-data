You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a set A = \\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N \\} consisting of N positive integers. Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

Initially, we have a pile consisting of K stones. The two players perform the following operation alternately, starting from Taro:

* Choose an element x in A, and remove exactly x stones from the pile.



A player loses when he becomes unable to play. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_N \leq K

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N


Output

If Taro will win, print `First`; if Jiro will win, print `Second`.

Program:

def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in xrange(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the initial number of stones `K` is less than the smallest element in set `A`. In such a case, the first player (Taro) cannot make a move and thus loses the game. However, the current implementation of the dynamic programming approach does not account for this scenario.

To fix this, you need to add a check at the beginning of the function to see if `K` is less than the smallest element in `A`. Here is an example of how the program should handle this case:

```python
import os
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    # Check if K is less than the smallest element in A
    if k < a[0]:
        os.write(1, b'Second')
        return
    
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in range(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    
    os.write(1, b'First' if dp[k] else b'Second')

func()
```

With this addition, the program will correctly handle the case where `K` is less than the smallest element in `A`, ensuring that the program works for all potential cases described in the problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing a set A where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N ≤ K, with constraints 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5. It constructs a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length `k + 1` initialized to `False`. It then marks the positions in `dp` corresponding to elements in `a` as `True`. After that, it fills the rest of the `dp` array based on the subset sum problem, determining whether each value up to `k` can be formed using the elements in `a`. Finally, it writes 'First' to standard output if `dp[k]` is `True`, indicating that the value `k` can be formed, otherwise it writes 'Second'. Potential edge cases include when `a` contains all values from 1 to K, in which case `dp[k]` will always be `True`. If `k` is less than the maximum element in `a`, `dp[k]` will remain `False`. The function does not handle cases where the input constraints are violated.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
