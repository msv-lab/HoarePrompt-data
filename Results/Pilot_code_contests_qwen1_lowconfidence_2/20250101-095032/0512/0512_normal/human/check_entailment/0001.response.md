Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of stones \(K\) is less than the smallest element in set \(A\). In such cases, the first player (Taro) would immediately lose because they cannot make a valid move. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1
1
```
In this case, the initial number of stones is 1, and the only element in set \(A\) is also 1. According to the problem description, Taro (the first player) should lose because he cannot make a valid move. However, the current program incorrectly outputs `First`.

To fix this, the program should check if \(K\) is less than the smallest element in \(A\) before proceeding with the dynamic programming approach. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import os
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    input = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    # Check if K is less than the smallest element in A
    if k < a[0]:
        os.write(1, 'Second'.encode())
        return
    
    dp = [False] * (k + 1)
    for ai in a:
        dp[ai] = True
    for i in range(max(a) + 1, k + 1):
        dp[i] = any((not dp[i - ai] for ai in a))
    
    os.write(1, 'First' if dp[k] else 'Second')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the edge case correctly and outputs the right result for all potential inputs.
