l is a list of non-negative integers representing counts of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively (a, b, c, d), where the sum of the elements in l is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5 (i.e., l[0] + l[1] + l[2] + l[3] > 0 and l[0] + l[1] + l[2] + l[3] â‰¤ 10^5). start and end are non-negative integers representing the starting and ending adjustments to the range function call.
