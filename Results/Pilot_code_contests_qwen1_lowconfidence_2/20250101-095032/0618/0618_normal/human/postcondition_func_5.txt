The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` containing non-negative integers and two non-negative integers `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts from `start` and ends at `len(l) + end`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond returning this range object. Potential edge cases include when `start` or `end` are negative (though the function signature ensures they are non-negative), and when `l` is an empty list (in which case `len(l)` would be 0, making the range start from `start` and end just before `end`). However, the function correctly handles these cases as per the code provided.
