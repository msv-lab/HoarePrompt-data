Precondition: **x is a non-negative integer representing the count of a specific number in the sequence, and r is a positive integer representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (r can be 0, 1, or 3).** 

Explanation: The function `func_8` is not directly related to the problem of constructing a beautiful sequence, but it seems to be a helper function used elsewhere in the solution. The precondition specifies the types and constraints of the parameters `x` and `r`.
