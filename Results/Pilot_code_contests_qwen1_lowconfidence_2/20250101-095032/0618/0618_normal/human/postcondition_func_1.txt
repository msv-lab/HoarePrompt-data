The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` as parameters. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and the function returns `x`. The function handles the case where `y` is initially 0, in which case it directly returns `x` without entering the loop.
