The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(0 < n \leq 10^5\). It calculates and returns \(2\) raised to the power of the bit length of \((n - 1)\). This means that if `n` is within the specified range, the function will correctly compute \(2^{(n-1).bit_length()}\), which effectively gives the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to \(n\). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code does not have any missing functionality. The function will always return a positive integer result.
