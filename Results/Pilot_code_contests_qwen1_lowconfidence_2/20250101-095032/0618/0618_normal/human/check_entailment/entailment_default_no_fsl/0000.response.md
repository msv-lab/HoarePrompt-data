Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not account for situations where the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` do not allow the construction of a beautiful sequence. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Analysis**: The function `func_1` tries to construct a beautiful sequence based on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. However, it does not cover all possible scenarios where a beautiful sequence cannot be formed. For example, if `a` and `b` are not balanced in such a way that the differences between consecutive numbers can be consistently 1, the sequence cannot be constructed.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Example 1**: Consider the input `1 2 3 4`. According to the problem, it should be impossible to construct a beautiful sequence, but the code incorrectly prints "YES" and provides a sequence. This is a clear case where the code fails.
   - **Example 2**: Consider the input `2 2 2 3`. Again, it should be impossible to construct a beautiful sequence, but the code incorrectly prints "YES" and provides a sequence. This is another case where the code fails.

3. **General Case Handling**: The function `func_1` attempts to construct the sequence by manipulating `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on certain conditions. However, these conditions are insufficient to cover all possible invalid cases. For instance, if the number of 0s and 1s is not balanced in a way that allows a consistent difference of 1 between consecutive numbers, the sequence cannot be constructed.

To correctly handle all potential cases, the code needs to explicitly check if it is possible to form a beautiful sequence based on the counts of `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`. If the counts do not allow for a consistent difference of 1 between consecutive numbers, the code should print "NO".
