You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the beautiful sequence does not always produce a valid sequence, especially when the counts of the numbers do not allow for a valid sequence to be constructed.

For example, consider the input `1 2 3 4`. According to the problem description, it should output "NO" because it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence with the given constraints. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and may attempt to construct a sequence that violates the beautiful sequence condition.

To illustrate, let's analyze the logic for the input `1 2 3 4`:
- `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, `d = 4`
- The differences `s1 = b - a = 2 - 1 = 1` and `s2 = c - d = 3 - 4 = -1`
- Since `s1` and `s2` do not match any of the conditions specified in the `if` statements, the program incorrectly prints "NO", which is correct in this case but demonstrates a failure to handle the logic properly.

Another example where the program fails is the input `2 2 2 3`. The program should output "NO" because it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence with these counts. However, the current implementation might incorrectly generate a sequence that violates the beautiful sequence condition due to the logic not being exhaustive enough to cover all invalid cases.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `x` representing the count of a specific number in a sequence, and a positive integer `r` representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (which can be 0, 1, or 3). It returns the result of the expression `(x + r - 1) // r`. This expression effectively calculates the minimum number of groups needed to distribute `x` items such that no group has more than `r` consecutive items.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
