Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when the counts of the numbers do not allow for a valid sequence to be constructed. 

Specifically:
1. For the input `1 2 3 4`, the program incorrectly prints "YES" instead of "NO". The logic for constructing the beautiful sequence does not account for the fact that it is impossible to create a sequence where the counts of 1 and 2 differ by 1 and the counts of 0 and 3 differ by 1.
2. For the input `2 2 2 3`, the program also incorrectly prints "YES" instead of "NO". Similar to the previous case, the counts do not allow for a valid sequence to be constructed.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether a beautiful sequence can be constructed under the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.
