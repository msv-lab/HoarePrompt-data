Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_1` does not always generate a beautiful sequence as described in the problem. Specifically, the conditions for constructing the sequence do not cover all possible cases where a valid sequence cannot be formed.

For instance, consider the input `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1`. According to the problem description, a valid sequence should exist, but the code provided in `func_1` does not cover all necessary conditions to form such a sequence.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. The code checks if `s1 == s2`, `s1 + 1 == s2`, and `s1 == s2 + 1`. However, there are cases where these conditions do not hold, and the code incorrectly prints "NO".

2. For the given input `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1`, neither of the conditions `s1 == s2`, `s1 + 1 == s2`, or `s1 == s2 + 1` are met. The code then prints "NO", indicating it cannot form a beautiful sequence, which is incorrect because a valid sequence can be formed (e.g., `0 1 2 3 2 1 0`).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
