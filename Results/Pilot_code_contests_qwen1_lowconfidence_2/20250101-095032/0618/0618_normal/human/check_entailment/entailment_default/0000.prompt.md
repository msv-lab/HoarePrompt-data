You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

    else:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(*out)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function takes no parameters and performs a series of conditional operations based on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It adjusts these values according to specific rules and constructs a list `out` based on the conditions. The function checks whether `s1` (which is `b - a`) equals `s2` (which is `c - d`). If `s1` equals `s2`, it constructs `out` as a list of specific sequences. If `s1` plus 1 equals `s2`, it either decrements `a` or `c` and constructs `out` accordingly. If `s1` plus 1 does not equal `s2`, it either decrements `d` or increments `b`, constructs `out`, and ensures `c` is set to a non-zero value other than 1. If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO' and returns. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and prints the constructed list `out`. The function returns `None` after printing the result.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` as parameters. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and the function returns `x`. The function handles the case where `y` is initially 0, in which case it directly returns `x` without entering the loop.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into four space-separated integers, and returns them as a list. The integers a, b, c, and d are required to be non-negative and their sum must be between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. The function ensures that exactly four integers are provided, and each integer is converted to an integer type. If the input does not consist of exactly four integers, or if any of the integers are negative or their sum exceeds 100,000, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle these cases.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(f, *dim):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a callable function `f` and a variable-length tuple `dim` of positive integers. If `dim` is not empty, it constructs a nested list with dimensions specified by `dim`, where each element in the deepest list is the result of calling `f()`. If `dim` is empty, it simply calls `f()` and returns its result. The function supports the case where `dim` can have any number of positive integers, including zero, making it flexible for creating nested lists of various depths.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start`, `step`, and `count`. It returns a `range` object representing a sequence of numbers starting from `start`, ending at `start + step * count`, and incrementing or decrementing by `step`. If `step` is positive, the sequence increases by `step` for each subsequent number; if `step` is negative, the sequence decreases by `step` for each subsequent number. The function covers the following cases:
1. If `count` is 0, the function returns an empty `range` object.
2. If `step` is 0, the function raises a `ValueError` because a `range` with a step of 0 is invalid.
3. The function returns a `range` object that includes `count` elements, even if `start + step * count` is out of bounds (e.g., when dealing with very large or very small integers).
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(l, start=0, end=0):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` containing non-negative integers and two non-negative integers `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts from `start` and ends at `len(l) + end`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond returning this range object. Potential edge cases include when `start` or `end` are negative (though the function signature ensures they are non-negative), and when `l` is an empty list (in which case `len(l)` would be 0, making the range start from `start` and end just before `end`). However, the function correctly handles these cases as per the code provided.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(0 < n \leq 10^5\). It calculates and returns \(2\) raised to the power of the bit length of \((n - 1)\). This means that if `n` is within the specified range, the function will correctly compute \(2^{(n-1).bit_length()}\), which effectively gives the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to \(n\). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code does not have any missing functionality. The function will always return a positive integer result.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `x` representing the count of a specific number in a sequence, and a positive integer `r` representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (which can be 0, 1, or 3). It returns the result of the expression `(x + r - 1) // r`. This expression effectively calculates the minimum number of groups needed to distribute `x` items such that no group has more than `r` consecutive items.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
