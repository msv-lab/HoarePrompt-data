You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not cover all potential cases where constructing a beautiful sequence is not possible. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the absolute differences between counts of consecutive numbers (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3) are not within the valid range for forming a beautiful sequence.

For instance, consider the input `3 2 1 2`. In this case:
- `a = 3`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`, `d = 2`
- The differences are `s1 = b - a = 2 - 3 = -1` and `s2 = c - d = 1 - 2 = -1`

The program does not check if these differences fall within the valid range for forming a beautiful sequence. Since both `s1` and `s2` are negative and their magnitudes are not 1, it should print "NO", but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To fix this, additional checks should be added to ensure the differences between counts of consecutive numbers are within the valid range for forming a beautiful sequence.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

If `s1 + 1 == s2` and `d <= 0`, then `b` increases by 1, `d` resets to 0, and `c` is set to a non-zero value other than 1, with `out` being `[1, 0] * a + [1]`. Otherwise, if `s1 + 1 != s2` and `d > 0`, then `d` decreases by 1, and `out` remains `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

    print('YES')
    print(*out)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and performs a series of conditional operations based on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It adjusts these values according to specific rules and constructs a list `out` based on the conditions. The function checks whether `s1` (which is `b - a`) equals `s2` (which is `c - d`). If `s1` equals `s2`, it constructs `out` as a list of specific sequences. If `s1` plus 1 equals `s2`, it either decrements `a` or `c` and constructs `out` accordingly. If `s1` plus 1 does not equal `s2`, it either decrements `d` or increments `b`, constructs `out`, and ensures `c` is set to a non-zero value other than 1. If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO' and returns. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and prints the constructed list `out`. The function returns `None` after printing the result.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of x and y, where y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` as parameters. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function enters a loop where it repeatedly updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and the function returns `x`. The function handles the case where `y` is initially 0, in which case it directly returns `x` without entering the loop.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers [a, b, c, d] as input by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into four space-separated integers, and returns them as a list. The integers a, b, c, and d are required to be non-negative and their sum must be between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. The function ensures that exactly four integers are provided, and each integer is converted to an integer type. If the input does not consist of exactly four integers, or if any of the integers are negative or their sum exceeds 100,000, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle these cases.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable function and dim is a variable-length tuple of positive integers representing dimensions for creating a nested list structure. The final result is a nested list where each dimension corresponds to the provided dimensions in dim. Each element in the deepest list is the result of calling f().
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #[func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a callable function `f` and a variable-length tuple `dim` of positive integers. If `dim` is not empty, it constructs a nested list with dimensions specified by `dim`, where each element in the deepest list is the result of calling `f()`. If `dim` is empty, it simply calls `f()` and returns its result. The function supports the case where `dim` can have any number of positive integers, including zero, making it flexible for creating nested lists of various depths.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting number of the sequence, step is an integer representing the increment or decrement value between consecutive numbers (step will be either 1 or -1 for a beautiful sequence), and count is a positive integer representing the number of times the sequence should be repeated.
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #range object from start to start + step * count with a step of step
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start`, `step`, and `count`. It returns a `range` object representing a sequence of numbers starting from `start`, ending at `start + step * count`, and incrementing or decrementing by `step`. If `step` is positive, the sequence increases by `step` for each subsequent number; if `step` is negative, the sequence decreases by `step` for each subsequent number. The function covers the following cases:
1. If `count` is 0, the function returns an empty `range` object.
2. If `step` is 0, the function raises a `ValueError` because a `range` with a step of 0 is invalid.
3. The function returns a `range` object that includes `count` elements, even if `start + step * count` is out of bounds (e.g., when dealing with very large or very small integers).

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of non-negative integers representing counts of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively (a, b, c, d), where the sum of the elements in l is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5 (i.e., l[0] + l[1] + l[2] + l[3] > 0 and l[0] + l[1] + l[2] + l[3] ≤ 10^5). start and end are non-negative integers representing the starting and ending adjustments to the range function call.
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #`The program returns a range object from start to len(l) + end`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` containing non-negative integers and two non-negative integers `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts from `start` and ends at `len(l) + end`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond returning this range object. Potential edge cases include when `start` or `end` are negative (though the function signature ensures they are non-negative), and when `l` is an empty list (in which case `len(l)` would be 0, making the range start from `start` and end just before `end`). However, the function correctly handles these cases as per the code provided.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 0 < n ≤ 10^5.
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of the bit length of (n - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(0 < n \leq 10^5\). It calculates and returns \(2\) raised to the power of the bit length of \((n - 1)\). This means that if `n` is within the specified range, the function will correctly compute \(2^{(n-1).bit_length()}\), which effectively gives the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to \(n\). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code does not have any missing functionality. The function will always return a positive integer result.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer representing the count of a specific number in the sequence, and r is a positive integer representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (r can be 0, 1, or 3).
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #`(x + r - 1) // r` where `x` is a non-negative integer representing the count of a specific number in the sequence, and `r` is a positive integer representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (r can be 0, 1, or 3)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `x` representing the count of a specific number in a sequence, and a positive integer `r` representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (which can be 0, 1, or 3). It returns the result of the expression `(x + r - 1) // r`. This expression effectively calculates the minimum number of groups needed to distribute `x` items such that no group has more than `r` consecutive items.
