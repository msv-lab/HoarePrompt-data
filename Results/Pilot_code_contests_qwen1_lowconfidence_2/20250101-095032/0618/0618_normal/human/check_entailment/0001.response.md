Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the beautiful sequence does not always produce a valid sequence, especially when the counts of the numbers do not allow for a valid sequence to be constructed.

For example, consider the input `1 2 3 4`. According to the problem description, it should output "NO" because it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence with the given constraints. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and may attempt to construct a sequence that violates the beautiful sequence condition.

To illustrate, let's analyze the logic for the input `1 2 3 4`:
- `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, `d = 4`
- The differences `s1 = b - a = 2 - 1 = 1` and `s2 = c - d = 3 - 4 = -1`
- Since `s1` and `s2` do not match any of the conditions specified in the `if` statements, the program incorrectly prints "NO", which is correct in this case but demonstrates a failure to handle the logic properly.

Another example where the program fails is the input `2 2 2 3`. The program should output "NO" because it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence with these counts. However, the current implementation might incorrectly generate a sequence that violates the beautiful sequence condition due to the logic not being exhaustive enough to cover all invalid cases.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
