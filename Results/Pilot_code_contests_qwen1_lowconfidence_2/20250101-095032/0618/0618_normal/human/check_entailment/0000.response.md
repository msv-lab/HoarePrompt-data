Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not cover all potential cases where constructing a beautiful sequence is not possible. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the absolute differences between counts of consecutive numbers (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3) are not within the valid range for forming a beautiful sequence.

For instance, consider the input `3 2 1 2`. In this case:
- `a = 3`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`, `d = 2`
- The differences are `s1 = b - a = 2 - 3 = -1` and `s2 = c - d = 1 - 2 = -1`

The program does not check if these differences fall within the valid range for forming a beautiful sequence. Since both `s1` and `s2` are negative and their magnitudes are not 1, it should print "NO", but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To fix this, additional checks should be added to ensure the differences between counts of consecutive numbers are within the valid range for forming a beautiful sequence.
