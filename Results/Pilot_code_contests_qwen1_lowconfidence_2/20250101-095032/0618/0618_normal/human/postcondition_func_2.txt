The function `func_3()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into four space-separated integers, and returns them as a list. The integers a, b, c, and d are required to be non-negative and their sum must be between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. The function ensures that exactly four integers are provided, and each integer is converted to an integer type. If the input does not consist of exactly four integers, or if any of the integers are negative or their sum exceeds 100,000, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle these cases.
