The function `func_4` accepts a callable function `f` and a variable-length tuple `dim` of positive integers. If `dim` is not empty, it constructs a nested list with dimensions specified by `dim`, where each element in the deepest list is the result of calling `f()`. If `dim` is empty, it simply calls `f()` and returns its result. The function supports the case where `dim` can have any number of positive integers, including zero, making it flexible for creating nested lists of various depths.
