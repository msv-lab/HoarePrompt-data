The function takes no parameters and performs a series of conditional operations based on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It adjusts these values according to specific rules and constructs a list `out` based on the conditions. The function checks whether `s1` (which is `b - a`) equals `s2` (which is `c - d`). If `s1` equals `s2`, it constructs `out` as a list of specific sequences. If `s1` plus 1 equals `s2`, it either decrements `a` or `c` and constructs `out` accordingly. If `s1` plus 1 does not equal `s2`, it either decrements `d` or increments `b`, constructs `out`, and ensures `c` is set to a non-zero value other than 1. If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO' and returns. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and prints the constructed list `out`. The function returns `None` after printing the result.
