The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and return `x` if `y` is 0, where `x` is the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
