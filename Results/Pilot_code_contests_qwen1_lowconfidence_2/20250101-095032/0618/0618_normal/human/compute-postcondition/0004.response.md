To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop itself.

### Given Information
- **Previous State:**
  - `x` is `x_val % y_val`
  - `y` is `x_val % (x_val % y_val)`

- **Loop Condition:**
  - `while y:`

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Values and Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while y:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `y` is non-zero.

2. **Understanding the Loop Body:**
   - In the loop, `x` is updated to `x_val % y_val`.
   - `y` is updated to `x_val % (x_val % y_val)`, which simplifies to `y_val % x`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - After the first iteration, `x` becomes `x_val % y_val`.
   - `y` becomes `y_val % (x_val % y_val)`.
   - In the second iteration, `x` becomes `y_val % (x_val % y_val)`.
   - `y` becomes `(x_val % y_val) % (y_val % (x_val % y_val))`.

4. **Condition for Loop Continuation:**
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be non-zero.
   - Since `y` is calculated as `y_val % (x_val % y_val)` in the first iteration, `y` will be zero only if `x_val % y_val` equals `y_val`. Otherwise, `y` will be some positive remainder and the loop will continue.

5. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be non-zero after the current iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `y` is not zero after the loop updates.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be non-zero. Since `y` is calculated based on the values of `x_val` and `y_val`, and the loop updates these values accordingly, the critical state to adjust is `y` itself.

### Final Answer
State: **`x` is `x_val % y_val`; `y` must be non-zero**
