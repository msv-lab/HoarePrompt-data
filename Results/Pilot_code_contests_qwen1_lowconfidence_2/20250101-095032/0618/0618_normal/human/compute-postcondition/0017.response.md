The value of `d` is decremented by 1. Initially, `d` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. Since `d` is decremented by 1, the new value of `d` will be `d - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

- `a` is a non-negative integer.
- `b` is a non-negative integer.
- `c` is a non-negative integer.
- `d` is now a non-negative integer and is `d - 1` (since `d` was originally a non-negative integer greater than 0).
- `s1` is `b - a`.
- `s2` is `c - d`.
- `s1` is not equal to `s2`.
- `s1 + 1` is equal to `s2`.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `a` is a non-negative integer.
- `b` is a non-negative integer.
- `c` is a non-negative integer.
- `d` is `d - 1`.
- `s1` is `b - a`.
- `s2` is `c - (d - 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is `d - 1`, `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - (d - 1)`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1 + 1` is equal to `s2`**
