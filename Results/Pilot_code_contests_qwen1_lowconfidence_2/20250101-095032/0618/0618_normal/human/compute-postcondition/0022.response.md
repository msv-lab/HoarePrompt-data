Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - d`. If `d > 0`, then `d` is decremented by 1, `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`. If `d <= 0`, then `b` is incremented by 1, `d` is reset to 0, and `c` is set to a non-zero value other than 1, with `out` being `[1, 0] * a + [1]`.***
