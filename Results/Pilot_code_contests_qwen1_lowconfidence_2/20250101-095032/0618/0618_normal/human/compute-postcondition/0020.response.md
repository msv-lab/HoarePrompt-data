The value of `b` is decremented by 1. Initially, `b` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is also a non-negative integer, so `b - a` remains `s1`. Since `b` is decreased by 1, `s1` will be updated to `(b - 1) - a`, which simplifies to `b - a - 1`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer (now `b-1`), `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is 0, `s1` is `b - a - 1`, `s2` is `c - d`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer (now `b-1`), `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is 0, `s1` is `b - a - 1`, `s2` is `c - d`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`**
