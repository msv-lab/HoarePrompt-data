The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. 

- `x` is a non-negative integer representing the count of a specific number in the sequence.
- `r` is a positive integer representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (r can be 0, 1, or 3).

After executing the function body, the function returns the result of the expression `(x + r - 1) // r`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a non-negative integer `x` and a positive integer `r`, and return the result of the expression `(x + r - 1) // r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `x` and a positive integer `r`, and returns the result of the expression `(x + r - 1) // r`.**
