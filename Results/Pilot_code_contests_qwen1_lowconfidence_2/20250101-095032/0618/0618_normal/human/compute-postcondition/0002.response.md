Functionality: **The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `x` representing the count of a specific number in a sequence, and a positive integer `r` representing the allowed consecutive numbers in the sequence (which can be 0, 1, or 3). It returns the result of the expression `(x + r - 1) // r`. This expression effectively calculates the minimum number of groups needed to distribute `x` items such that no group has more than `r` consecutive items.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `r == 0`, the expression `(x + r - 1) // r` is undefined because division by zero is not allowed. In practice, the function should handle this case by raising an error or returning a specific value.
- If `r == 1`, the expression simplifies to `x`, meaning each item is in its own group.
- If `r == 3`, the function will distribute `x` items into groups of up to 3 consecutive items, rounded up to the nearest whole number of groups.

**Summary of Actions:**
- The function calculates the minimum number of groups needed to distribute `x` items such that no group has more than `r` consecutive items.
- The function handles the cases where `r` is 0, 1, or 3 appropriately.
- After executing, the function returns an integer representing the number of groups required.
