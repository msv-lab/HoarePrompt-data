`c` is decremented by 1. The value of `c` was originally a non-negative integer, and now it is one less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated conditions are:
- `a` is a non-negative integer (and still less than or equal to 0)
- `b` is a non-negative integer
- `d` is a non-negative integer
- `s1` is still `b - a`
- `s2` is still `c - d`
- `s1` is not equal to `s2`
- `s1` plus 1 is not equal to `s2`

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer minus 1, `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - d`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1` plus 1 is not equal to `s2`**
