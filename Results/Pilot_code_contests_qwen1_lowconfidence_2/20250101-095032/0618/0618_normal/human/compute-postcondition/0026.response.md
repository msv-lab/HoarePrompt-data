Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - d`. 

If `s1 + 1 == s2`, then `a` becomes `a - 1` (if `a > 0`) and the list `out` is constructed as follows: it consists of a sequence `[1, 0]` repeated `a` times, followed by `[1, 2]` repeated `b - a` times, and `[3, 2]` repeated `d` times.

Otherwise (`s1 + 1 != s2`), if `d > 0`, then `d` is decremented by 1, and the list `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`. If `d <= 0`, then `b` is incremented by 1, `d` is reset to 0, and `c` is set to a non-zero value other than 1, with `out` being `[1, 0] * a + [1]`.***
