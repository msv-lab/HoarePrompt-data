The code `x, y = y, x % y` updates the values of `x` and `y`. Initially, `y` is `x_val % y_val`, and `y` must be non-zero.

1. The new value of `x` is set to the current value of `y`, which is `x_val % y_val`.
2. The new value of `y` is set to `x % y`, which is `x_val % (x_val % y_val)`.

Since `y` is non-zero initially, `x_val % y_val` is also non-zero. Let's denote `y_val` as `a` and `x_val` as `b`. So, `y = b % a`.

The new value of `x` becomes `b % a`.
The new value of `y` becomes `b % (b % a)`.

By the properties of modulo operation, `b % (b % a)` simplifies to `b % r`, where `r` is the remainder when `b` is divided by `a`. This is equivalent to the remainder when `b` is divided by `b % a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `b % a`; `y` is `b % (b % a)`, which simplifies to `b % (b % a)`.

Output State: **`x` is `x_val % y_val`; `y` is `x_val % (x_val % y_val)`**
