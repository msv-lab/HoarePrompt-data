Postcondition: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer (with adjustments in the else part), `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `c - d`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1` plus 1 is equal to `s2`. The list `out` is constructed as follows: it consists of a sequence `[1, 0]` repeated `a` times, followed by `[1, 2]` repeated `b - a` times, and `[3, 2]` repeated `d` times. In the case where `a` is greater than 0, `a` becomes `a - 1`. In the else part, `c` becomes `c - 1` and the sequence construction remains as previously described.**
