Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the inclusion of the interval boundaries themselves when their first and last digits match. Specifically, the code only counts numbers of varying lengths starting from 1 to 9 and does not explicitly check the `lower` and `upper` boundaries for this condition. This oversight means that if the `lower` or `upper` boundary is a valid number (i.e., its first and last digits are the same), it will not be counted unless it falls within the constructed range of numbers during the loop iterations. 

For example, in the input `22 33`, the numbers 22 and 33 should be included in the count, but the current logic might miss them. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program needs to be revised to handle the boundary conditions appropriately.
