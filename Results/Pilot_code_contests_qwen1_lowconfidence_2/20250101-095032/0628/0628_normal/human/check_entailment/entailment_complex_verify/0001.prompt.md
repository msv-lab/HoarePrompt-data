You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Little Elephant very much loves sums on intervals.

This time he has a pair of integers l and r (l ≤ r). The Little Elephant has to find the number of such integers x (l ≤ x ≤ r), that the first digit of integer x equals the last one (in decimal notation). For example, such numbers as 101, 477474 or 9 will be included in the answer and 47, 253 or 1020 will not.

Help him and count the number of described numbers x for a given pair l and r.

Input

The single line contains a pair of integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — the boundaries of the interval.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

On a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

2 47


Output

12


Input

47 1024


Output

98

Note

In the first sample the answer includes integers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44. 
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    (lower, upper) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = 0
    for val in range(1, 10):
        if lower <= val <= upper:
            res += 1
    for length in range(2, 19):
        for startend in range(1, 10):
            alreadyval = startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else startend)
            smallestpos = max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)
            largestpos = min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)
            res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `lower` is greater than `upper`. In such cases, the program will still perform the calculations, leading to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `47 2`, the program will still run through the loops and calculate the result as 12, which is incorrect since there are no valid numbers between 47 and 2.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `lower` is less than or equal to `upper`. If not, the function should immediately return 0.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18.
def func_1():
    lower, upper = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = 0
    for val in range(1, 10):
        if lower <= val <= upper:
            res += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State Recap:
    #- `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).
    #- `lower` is the first integer input.
    #- `upper` is the second integer input.
    #- `res` is initialized to 0.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis:
    #The loop iterates over the range from 1 to 10 (inclusive). For each `val` in this range, the loop checks if `lower <= val <= upper`. If this condition is true, `res` is incremented by 1.
    #
    #### Key Observations:
    #- The loop will always iterate exactly 9 times (from `val = 1` to `val = 9`), because the range starts at 1 and ends at 10, exclusive.
    #- Whether the condition `lower <= val <= upper` holds true or not for each iteration does not affect the number of iterations; it only affects whether `res` is incremented.
    #
    #### Final State Calculation:
    #- Regardless of the values of `lower` and `upper`, the loop will iterate 9 times, and `res` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where the condition is met.
    #- If the condition `lower <= val <= upper` is true for any `val` in the range from 1 to 9, `res` will be incremented by 1 for those values.
    #- Therefore, the maximum value `res` can achieve is 9, but it depends on the values of `lower` and `upper`.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #Given that the loop always runs 9 times and increments `res` based on the condition `lower <= val <= upper`, we can summarize the final state as follows:
    #
    #- If the condition `lower <= val <= upper` is true for any `val` in the range from 1 to 9, `res` will be incremented by 1 for those values.
    #- The exact value of `res` will be the count of numbers between `lower` and `upper` (inclusive) that lie within the range from 1 to 9.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #**Output State: `res` is the count of integers from 1 to 9 that satisfy `lower <= val <= upper`, `val` is the last value checked in the loop, and `l` and `r` retain their initial values.**
    for length in range(2, 19):
        for startend in range(1, 10):
            alreadyval = startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else
                startend)
            smallestpos = max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)
            largestpos = min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, (upper - alreadyval) / 10)
            res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two inputs, `lower` and `upper`, which are the lower and upper bounds of a range of integers. It counts the number of integers within the range from 1 to 9 that fall within the specified bounds (`lower` to `upper`). Specifically, it iterates over all possible lengths of numbers from 2 to 18 digits, and for each length, it calculates the count of valid starting positions (from 1 to 9) that fall within the given range. The function then sums up these counts and prints the total count of valid integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
