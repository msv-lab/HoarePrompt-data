Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the case where `lower` is greater than `upper`. Even though the annotated version mentions that the input is assumed to be valid and non-error-causing, the code itself does not include a check to handle the invalid order of `lower` and `upper`. This means that if `lower > upper`, the program will still perform the calculations, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
