First, let's determine the values of `smallestpos` and `largestpos` based on the initial state.

Given:
- `startend` is 10
- `alreadyval` is 110
- `smallestpos` is the maximum of 0 and \(\left(\frac{\text{lower} - 101}{10}\right)\)
- `largestpos` is \(\min\left(10^{(\text{length} - 2)} - 1, \left(\frac{\text{upper} - \text{alreadyval}}{10}\right)\right)\)
- `res` is 1

For simplicity, let's assume:
- `lower` is 100
- `upper` is 120
- `length` is 3 (since `upper` is a three-digit number)

Now, calculate `smallestpos`:
\[ \text{smallestpos} = \max\left(0, \frac{100 - 101}{10}\right) = \max(0, -0.1) = 0 \]

Next, calculate `largestpos`:
\[ \text{largestpos} = \min\left(10^{(3 - 2)} - 1, \frac{120 - 110}{10}\right) = \min(9, 1) = 1 \]

Now, execute the code snippet:
```python
res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
```

Substitute the values of `largestpos` and `smallestpos`:
\[ res += max(0, 1 - 0 + 1) = res += max(0, 2) = res += 2 \]

Since `res` was initially 1, after adding 2, `res` becomes 3.

Output State: **`startend` is 10, `alreadyval` is 110, `smallestpos` is 0, `largestpos` is 1, `res` is 3**
