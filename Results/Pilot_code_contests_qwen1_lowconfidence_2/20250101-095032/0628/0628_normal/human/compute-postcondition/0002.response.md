Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to 10 (inclusive). This means the loop will execute 10 times if the condition is met.

2. **Determine the Necessary States**:
   - **Range Condition**: The loop requires an iterable range to iterate over. The given range is `range(1, 10)`, which means the loop body will execute 10 times with `val` taking values from 1 to 9.
   - **Loop Variable Initialization**: There is no explicit initialization of `val` within the loop, so `val` should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 1, before the loop starts.
   - **No Dependency on `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, or `res`**: Since the loop is iterating over a fixed range and does not depend on the values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, or `res`, these variables do not need to be modified based on the loop's execution.

3. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `val` should be 1 to start the loop.
   - The loop will execute 10 times regardless of the initial values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `res`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `val` must be 1.
- The loop will execute 10 times, but the values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, `upper`, and `res` do not need to be adjusted as they are not used in the loop body.

**State: **`val` is 1**
