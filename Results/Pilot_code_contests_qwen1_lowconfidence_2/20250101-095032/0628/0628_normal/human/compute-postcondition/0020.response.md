The given code snippet initializes a variable `alreadyval` using the formula `startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else startend)`. This formula suggests that `alreadyval` is computed based on the values of `startend` and `length`.

- If `length` is 1, `alreadyval` is set to `startend`.
- Otherwise, `alreadyval` is set to `startend * pow(10, length - 1) + startend`.

Since the code only assigns a value to `alreadyval` and does not affect any other variables, the output state includes the new value of `alreadyval` and retains the original values of `startend` and `length`.

Output State: **`alreadyval` is `startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else startend); `startend` is its original value; `length` is its original value**
