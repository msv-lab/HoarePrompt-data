First, let's analyze the given code snippet:
```python
alreadyval = startend * pow(10, length - 1) + (0 if length == 1 else startend)
```
From the initial state, we know that:
- `startend` is 10
- `alreadyval` for `startend` 9 is 9 (This doesn't affect the current `alreadyval`)
- `smallestpos` is -0.9
- `largestpos` is -0.9
- `res` is 1

The value of `length` is not explicitly given, but it can be inferred from the context. Since `startend` is used in the calculation, and the typical usage of `startend` suggests it might represent the number of digits or a similar length-related concept, we can assume `length` is 2 (since `startend` is a two-digit number).

Now, substituting the known values into the equation:
```python
alreadyval = 10 * pow(10, 2 - 1) + (0 if 2 == 1 else 10)
alreadyval = 10 * pow(10, 1) + 10
alreadyval = 10 * 10 + 10
alreadyval = 100 + 10
alreadyval = 110
```

So, `alreadyval` is updated to 110.

The output state, therefore, includes the updated value of `alreadyval` and the unchanged values of the other variables:
Output State: **`startend` is 10, `alreadyval` is 110, `smallestpos` is -0.9, `largestpos` is -0.9, `res` is 1**
