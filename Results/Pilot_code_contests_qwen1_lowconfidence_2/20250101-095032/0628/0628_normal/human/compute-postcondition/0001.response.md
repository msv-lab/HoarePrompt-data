The code initializes `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, or `upper`. Therefore, the only change is that `res` is now 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18; `lower` is the first integer input, and `upper` is the second integer input; `res` is 0**.
