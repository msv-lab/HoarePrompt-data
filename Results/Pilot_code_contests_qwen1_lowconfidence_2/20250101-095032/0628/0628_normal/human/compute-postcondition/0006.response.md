According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `val`. The loop will continue as long as `val` is within the range from 1 to 9 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `val` is 1, and it satisfies the condition `lower <= val <= upper`. 

The loop will continue to the next value of `val`, which means `val` will be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `val` must be 2, and it must still satisfy the condition `lower <= val <= upper`.

Since the initial condition `lower <= val <= upper` was satisfied with `val` being 1, and assuming `lower` is 1 (as `val` started at 1), `upper` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`val` is 2 and `lower` <= `val` <= `upper`**
