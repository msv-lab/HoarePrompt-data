According to the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop can execute again. The loop runs for each value of `startend` in the range from 1 to 9. Let's break down the necessary adjustments step by step.

1. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `res` is `res + max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)`
   - `alreadyval` is 0
   - `smallestpos` remains `max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)`
   - `largestpos` is updated to `min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, upper / 10)`
   - `startend` is 1
   - `length` is `length + 1`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `startend` in the range from 1 to 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `startend` must be 2.

3. **Other States**: The other states such as `res`, `alreadyval`, `smallestpos`, `largestpos`, and `length` remain unchanged until the loop body is executed. However, since the problem asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust `startend`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is `res + max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)`, `alreadyval` is 0, `smallestpos` remains `max(0, (lower - alreadyval + 9) / 10)`, `largestpos` is updated to `min(pow(10, length - 2) - 1, upper / 10)`, `startend` is 2, `length` is `length + 1`**
