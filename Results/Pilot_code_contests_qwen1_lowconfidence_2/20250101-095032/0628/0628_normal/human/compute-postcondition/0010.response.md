The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` is increased by 1 if `lower` <= 3 <= `upper`, and knowing that `val` is 3, the condition `lower` <= 3 <= `upper` is true, so `res` was already increased by 1 before this line of code. Now, `res` is incremented again.

Output State: **`val` is 3, `lower` <= `val` <= `upper`, `res` is increased by 1**
