The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `lower` and `upper`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18; `lower` is the first integer input, and `upper` is the second integer input.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18; `lower` is the first integer input, and `upper` is the second integer input.**
