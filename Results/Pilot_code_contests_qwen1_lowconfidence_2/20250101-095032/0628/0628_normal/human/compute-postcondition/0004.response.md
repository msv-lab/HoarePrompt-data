`res` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `val` is within the range of `lower` to `upper`, inclusive, but since the value of `val` itself is not directly modified in the given code snippet, it remains unchanged. The only change is that `res` has been incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`val` is 1, (lower <= val <= upper); `res` is 2**
