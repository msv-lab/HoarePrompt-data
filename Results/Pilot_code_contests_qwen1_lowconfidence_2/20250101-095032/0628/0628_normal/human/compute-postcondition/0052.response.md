First, let's determine the value of `smallestpos`:
- `smallestpos` is calculated as `max(0, (lower - alreadyval[startend] + 9) / 10)`
- Given that `alreadyval[startend]` can be one of the values 1000000001, 2000000002, ..., 9000000009, and `lower` is not specified but assumed to be less than these values, the minimum value for `alreadyval[startend]` is 1000000001.

Let's assume `lower` is 999999991 (a value just below the smallest `alreadyval[startend]` for simplicity):
- `smallestpos = max(0, (999999991 - 1000000001 + 9) / 10) = max(0, (-1000 + 9) / 10) = max(0, -99.1) = 0`

Next, the value of `largestpos` is given as 999999999.

Now, we execute the line:
```python
res += max(0, largestpos - smallestpos + 1)
```
- `res` was initially 81.
- `largestpos - smallestpos + 1 = 999999999 - 0 + 1 = 999999999 + 1 = 1000000000`.
- Therefore, `res += 1000000000`.

The updated value of `res` is `81 + 1000000000 = 1000000081`.

The values of `alreadyval[startend]` remain unchanged, and `smallestpos` and `largestpos` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is 1000000081, `alreadyval` for `startend` 1 is 1000000001, `alreadyval` for `startend` 2 is 2000000002, `alreadyval` for `startend` 3 is 3000000003, `alreadyval` for `startend` 4 is 4000000004, `alreadyval` for `startend` 5 is 5000000005, `alreadyval` for `startend` 6 is 6000000006, `alreadyval` for `startend` 7 is 7000000007, `alreadyval` for `startend` 8 is 8000000008, `alreadyval` for `startend` 9 is 9000000009, `smallestpos` is 0, `largestpos` is 999999999**
