`L` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(a, b)`. The function `func_1(a, b)` was previously called and its result was stored in `G`, but the actual value of `G` is not relevant since it is not used in the provided code snippet. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `a â‰  b`; `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`**
