`D` is assigned the value of `L - M`. From the initial state, we know that `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)` and `M` is equal to `(L / b - 1) * G`. Since `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, these relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `D` is calculated using the expressions for `L` and `M`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `a â‰  b`; `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`, `M` is equal to `(L / b - 1) * G`, `D` is `L - M`.**
