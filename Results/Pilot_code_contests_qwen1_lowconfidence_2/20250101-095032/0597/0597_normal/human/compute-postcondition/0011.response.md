`D` is assigned the value of `L - M`. From the initial state, we know that `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)` and `M` is `(L / a - 1) * G`, where `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. Since no specific values or expressions for `func_1` and `func_2` are provided, we will keep them as they are.

The value of `D` is calculated as follows:
\[ D = L - ((L / a - 1) * G) \]
\[ D = L - (L/a \cdot G - G) \]
\[ D = L - (L/a \cdot G) + G \]
\[ D = G + L(1 - 1/a) \]

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `a â‰  b`; `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`, `M` is `(L / a - 1) * G`, `D` is `G + L(1 - 1/a)`**
