The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, and `a ≠ b`.

- In **Case_1**, the function returns `M` which is equal to `((L / b - 1) * G)` and `D` which is equal to `(L - M)`, where `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)`, and `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- In **Case_2**, the function returns `D` which is less than or equal to `M`, where `D` is `L - M` and `M` is equal to `(L / b - 1) * G`.
- In **Case_3**, the function returns `M` which is calculated as `(L / a - 1) * G`, given that `D` is greater than `M`.
- In **Case_4**, the function returns `D * a`, where `D` is `G + L(1 - 1/a)` and `M` is `(L / a - 1) * G`, with `G` being the result of `func_1(a, b)` and `L` being the result of `func_2(a, b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` (with `a ≠ b`), and based on specific conditions, return one of four possible values involving calculations from `func_2(a, b)` and `func_1(a, b)`.
