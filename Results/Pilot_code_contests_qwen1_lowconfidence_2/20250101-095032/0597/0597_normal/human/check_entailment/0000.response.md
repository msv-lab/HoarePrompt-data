Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often. Instead, it contains several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that do not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem. The final function `func_6` attempts to compare the number of times Vasya would go to Dasha and Masha, but it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate how often Vasya would go to each girlfriend based on the intervals between trains. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def determine_frequent_girlfriend(a, b):
    # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
    lcm = (a * b) // func_1(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the number of times Vasya goes to each girlfriend in one LCM period
    count_Dasha = lcm // a
    count_Masha = lcm // b
    
    # Compare the counts
    if count_Dasha > count_Masha:
        return "Dasha"
    elif count_Dasha < count_Masha:
        return "Masha"
    else:
        return "Equal"

# Helper function to compute GCD
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function to compute LCM using GCD
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a * b) // func_1(a, b)

# Main function
def main():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    result = determine_frequent_girlfriend(a, b)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected program uses the `func_1` and `func_2` functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) respectively. It then calculates how often Vasya would go to each girlfriend within one LCM period and determines the result accordingly.
