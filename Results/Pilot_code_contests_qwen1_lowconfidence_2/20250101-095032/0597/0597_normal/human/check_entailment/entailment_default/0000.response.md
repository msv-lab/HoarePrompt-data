Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_6` does not correctly implement the logic for determining which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently. Specifically, the calculation of `M` and `D` in `func_6` does not accurately reflect the probability of Vasya descending into the subway during a particular time interval that would lead him to choose one direction over the other.

To understand why the function is incorrect, let's analyze the logic:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the GCD (`G`) of `a` and `b` using `func_1(a, b)`.
2. **LCM Calculation**: The function calculates the LCM (`L`) using `func_2(a, b)`, which is correct since `L = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.

However, the subsequent logic to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently is flawed. The function attempts to calculate the number of times Vasya would visit each girlfriend based on the intervals determined by the LCM and the individual frequencies `a` and `b`.

For example, consider the case when `a = 3` and `b = 5`:
- The LCM is 15.
- Vasya will visit Dasha more often because there are more intervals where a train goes to Dasha's direction (i.e., 5 intervals out of 15) compared to Masha (3 intervals out of 15).

The function `func_6` incorrectly handles this scenario. It does not correctly account for the fact that Vasya will visit each girlfriend in proportion to the frequency of the trains going to their respective directions.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:
- For `a = 3` and `b = 5`:
  - The LCM is 15.
  - Vasya should visit Dasha 5 times and Masha 3 times in a 15-minute period.
  - The function, however, incorrectly returns "Equal" or miscounts the visits based on the logic used.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently, making the correctness **False**.
