Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_6` does not correctly handle the scenario where Vasya descends into the subway at the same time as the simultaneous arrival of trains going to both directions. According to the problem description, if two trains arrive at the same time, Vasya goes towards the direction with the lower frequency of trains. However, the code in `func_6` does not account for this scenario properly. Specifically, the logic to determine the direction Vasya goes does not consider the simultaneous arrival of trains, leading to incorrect outputs in such cases.

For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 3`, and Vasya descends at the same time as the simultaneous arrival of trains, the code will not correctly handle this situation and may return an incorrect direction.
