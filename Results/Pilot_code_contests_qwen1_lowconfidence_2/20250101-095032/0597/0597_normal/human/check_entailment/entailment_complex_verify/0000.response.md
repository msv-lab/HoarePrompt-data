Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine to which girlfriend Vasya will go more often. Specifically, `func_6` does not correctly calculate the number of times Vasya would go to each girlfriend based on the intervals between trains. The logic in `func_6` is flawed and does not align with the problem description. The annotated version provides clarity that `func_6` is attempting to compare the number of times Vasya would go to Dasha and Masha, but the conditions and calculations are incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and cannot produce the correct output.
