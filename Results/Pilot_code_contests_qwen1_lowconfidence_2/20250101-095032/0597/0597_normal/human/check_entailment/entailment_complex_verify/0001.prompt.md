You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

Input

3 7


Output

Dasha


Input

5 3


Output

Masha


Input

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not handle the scenario where two trains arrive simultaneously and Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency of trains. This function does not account for this rule, leading to incorrect behavior in certain cases.

For example, consider the input `3 7`. According to the problem description, if two trains arrive simultaneously, Vasya will choose the direction with the lower frequency of trains. However, the current implementation does not handle this situation properly. Let's analyze the behavior:

- If Vasya descends at time 0, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha) and time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descends at time 1, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha).
- If Vasya descents at time 2, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha).
- If Vasya descents at time 3, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 4, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 5, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 6, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).

From this, we can see that Vasya would go to Dasha more often in this case, not Masha as the program incorrectly suggests. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
MAX = 10 ** 6
Da = 'Dasha'
Ma = 'Masha'
S = input.readline().split(' ')
a = int(S[0])
b = int(S[1])
assert 1 <= a and a <= MAX
assert 1 <= b and b <= MAX
assert a != b
answer = func_6(a, b)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a_0` and `b_0`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a_0 and b_0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where `a` and `b` are distinct and within the range `[1, 10^6]`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the variable `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns `a` as the GCD. This process handles all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly computes the GCD. Edge cases, such as when `a` or `b` is 1, are properly handled by the algorithm. The function does not include any additional actions beyond computing the GCD.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b, and a * b / func_1(a, b) is an integer.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b
    #The program returns (a / func_1(a, b) * b), given that a * b / func_1(a, b) is an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that `a ≠ b`. It calculates and returns the value of `(a / func_1(a, b) * b)`, provided that `a * b / func_1(a, b)` is an integer. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value that divides `a * b` evenly, the function will return a valid integer result. However, if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero or a value that does not divide `a * b` evenly, the function will raise a division by zero error or return a non-integer result, respectively. The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly, leaving the behavior undefined in such scenarios.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of two positive integers a and b where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to the two elements in the list `numbers`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `numbers` containing two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. It applies the function `func_1` to these two integers and returns the result. The function uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to sequentially apply `func_1` to the elements of the list. Since the list contains only two elements, the `reduce` function effectively calls `func_1` once with these two elements. There are no apparent edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not include any additional checks or conditions beyond the initial constraints on the input values.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and the integers represent possible descent times for Vasya in minutes since the start of the train schedule.
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first two elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, representing possible descent times for Vasya in minutes since the start of the train schedule. It returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first two elements. If the list contains fewer than two elements, an error or undefined behavior may occur due to the use of `reduce` without proper initialization or handling of empty lists. No additional postconditions are explicitly stated, but the final state of the program will be the result of the reduction operation applied to the list.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and represents the number of intervals within the period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
    #The program returns n * (n + 1) / 2, where n is an integer and represents the number of intervals within the period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of intervals within a period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. It calculates and returns the value of `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the provided logic is complete.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, and a ≠ b.
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if (a < b) :
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M which is equal to ((L / b - 1) * G) and D which is equal to (L - M), where L is the result of func_2(a, b), G is the result of func_1(a, b), and a ≠ b.
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D which is less than or equal to M, where D is L - M and M is equal to (L / b - 1) * G
    else :
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M which is calculated as (L / a - 1) * G, given that D is greater than M
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D * a, where D is G + L(1 - 1/a) and M is (L / a - 1) * G, with G being the result of func_1(a, b) and L being the result of func_2(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with the condition that `a ≠ b`. The function calculates and returns one of four possible values based on specific conditions involving the results of `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2(a, b)`.

- If `a < b`, the function calculates `M` as `((L / b - 1) * G)` and `D` as `(L - M)`, where `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)` and `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. It then returns either `M` or `D` depending on whether `D` is greater than `M`.
- If `a >= b`, the function calculates `M` as `(L / a - 1) * G` and `D` as `(G + L(1 - 1/a))`. It returns either `M` or `D * a` depending on whether `D` is greater than `M`.

In all cases, the function ensures that the returned value is either `M` or `D` under specific conditions related to the relative sizes of `M` and `D`. If `D` is not greater than `M`, the function returns `D` in the first case and `D * a` in the second case.
