You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

Input

3 7


Output

Dasha


Input

5 3


Output

Masha


Input

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    assert a * b / func_1(a, b) == a / func_1(a, b) * b
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b

#Function 3:
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)

#Function 4:
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)

#Function 5:
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2

#Function 6:
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if a < b:
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if D > M:
            return Ma
        else:
            return Da
    else:
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if D > M:
            return Ma
        else:
            return Da


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not handle the scenario where two trains arrive simultaneously and Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency of trains. This function does not account for this rule, leading to incorrect behavior in certain cases.

For example, consider the input `3 7`. According to the problem description, if two trains arrive simultaneously, Vasya will choose the direction with the lower frequency of trains. However, the current implementation does not handle this situation properly. Let's analyze the behavior:

- If Vasya descends at time 0, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha) and time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descends at time 1, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha).
- If Vasya descents at time 2, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha).
- If Vasya descents at time 3, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 4, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 5, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 6, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).

From this, we can see that Vasya would go to Dasha more often in this case, not Masha as the program incorrectly suggests. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with the condition that `a ≠ b`. The function calculates and returns one of four possible values based on specific conditions involving the results of `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2(a, b)`.

- If `a < b`, the function calculates `M` as `((L / b - 1) * G)` and `D` as `(L - M)`, where `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)` and `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. It then returns either `M` or `D` depending on whether `D` is greater than `M`.
- If `a >= b`, the function calculates `M` as `(L / a - 1) * G` and `D` as `(G + L(1 - 1/a))`. It returns either `M` or `D * a` depending on whether `D` is greater than `M`.

In all cases, the function ensures that the returned value is either `M` or `D` under specific conditions related to the relative sizes of `M` and `D`. If `D` is not greater than `M`, the function returns `D` in the first case and `D * a` in the second case.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
