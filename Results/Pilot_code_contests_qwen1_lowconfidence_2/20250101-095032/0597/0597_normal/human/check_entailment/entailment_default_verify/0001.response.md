Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where two trains arrive simultaneously, and Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency of trains. The function `func_6` does not account for this rule, leading to incorrect behavior in certain cases. For example, with the input `3 7`, the program incorrectly suggests that Vasya will go to Masha more often, when in fact, based on the problem description and the given output hints, he should go to Dasha more often. The function `func_6` needs to correctly implement the logic to handle simultaneous arrivals and choose the direction with the lower frequency of trains.
