Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when `a` and `b` are such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` is greater than the maximum allowed value (`10^6`). Specifically, the function `func_2` relies on the assumption that `a * b / func_1(a, b)` is an integer, which may not hold true for certain values of `a` and `b`.

For example, consider the input `a = 2` and `b = 3`. In this case, `func_1(2, 3)` returns `1`, and `func_2(2, 3)` returns `6`, because `2 * 3 / 1 = 6`, which is an integer. However, the LCM of `2` and `3` is `6`, which is within the valid range. The function works correctly for this case.

Now consider the input `a = 2` and `b = 500001`. Here, `func_1(2, 500001)` returns `1`, and `func_2(2, 500001)` attempts to compute `2 * 500001 / 1`, which is `1000002`. This value exceeds the maximum allowed value (`10^6`), leading to undefined behavior or potential errors in subsequent calculations.

Since the code does not handle this case and may lead to errors or incorrect results when `a * b / func_1(a, b)` exceeds `10^6`, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
