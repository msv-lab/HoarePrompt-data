Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic in `func_6` does not correctly determine how often Vasya will visit Dasha versus Masha based on the given frequencies `a` and `b`.

### Issues in `func_6`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Visits:**
   - The calculation of `M` and `D` (the number of visits to Masha and Dasha respectively) is flawed.
   - The logic should account for the fact that if two trains arrive at the same time, Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency.
   - The current implementation does not properly account for this rule.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem:**
   - The problem states that if two trains arrive at the same time, Vasya goes to the direction with the lower frequency. This means that if `a` and `b` have a common multiple, Vasyaâ€™s choice depends on the relative frequency of these trains.
   - The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times Vasya visits each girlfriend over a complete cycle of the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

- Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
- Determine the number of times Vasya would visit each girlfriend over one LCM period.
- Compare the number of visits to decide which girlfriend gets visited more often.

### Suggested Fix:
Here is a revised version of `func_6` that correctly implements the logic:

```python
import math

def func_6(a, b):
    lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
    dasha_visits = lcm // a
    masha_visits = lcm // b
    
    if dasha_visits > masha_visits:
        return 'Dasha'
    elif masha_visits > dasha_visits:
        return 'Masha'
    else:
        return 'Equal'
```

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate LCM:**
   - Use `math.gcd` to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
   - Compute the LCM using the formula `lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Count Visits:**
   - Calculate the number of times Vasya visits Dasha (`dasha_visits`) and Masha (`masha_visits`) over one LCM period.
   - Compare the counts to determine which girlfriend is visited more often.

This approach ensures that the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all cases as required.
