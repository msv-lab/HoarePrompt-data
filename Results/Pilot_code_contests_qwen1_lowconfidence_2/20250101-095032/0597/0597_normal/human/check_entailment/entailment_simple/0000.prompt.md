You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
MAX = 10 ** 6
Da = 'Dasha'
Ma = 'Masha'
S = input.readline().split(' ')
a = int(S[0])
b = int(S[1])
assert 1 <= a and a <= MAX
assert 1 <= b and b <= MAX
assert a != b
answer = func_6(a, b)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a_0` and `b_0`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a_0 and b_0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b, and a * b / func_1(a, b) is an integer.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b
    #The program returns (a / func_1(a, b) * b), given that a * b / func_1(a, b) is an integer

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of two positive integers a and b where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to the two elements in the list `numbers`

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and the integers represent possible descent times for Vasya in minutes since the start of the train schedule.
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first two elements

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and represents the number of intervals within the period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
    #The program returns n * (n + 1) / 2, where n is an integer and represents the number of intervals within the period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, and a ≠ b.
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if (a < b) :
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M which is equal to ((L / b - 1) * G) and D which is equal to (L - M), where L is the result of func_2(a, b), G is the result of func_1(a, b), and a ≠ b.
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D which is less than or equal to M, where D is L - M and M is equal to (L / b - 1) * G
    else :
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M which is calculated as (L / a - 1) * G, given that D is greater than M
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D * a, where D is G + L(1 - 1/a) and M is (L / a - 1) * G, with G being the result of func_1(a, b) and L being the result of func_2(a, b)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
