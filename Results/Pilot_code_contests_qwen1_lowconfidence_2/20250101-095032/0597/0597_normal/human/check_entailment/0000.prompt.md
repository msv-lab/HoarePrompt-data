You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence.

When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less frequently (see the note to the third sample).

We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.

Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b (a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Output

Print "Dasha" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, "Masha" if he will go to Masha more frequently, or "Equal" if he will go to both girlfriends with the same frequency.

Examples

Input

3 7


Output

Dasha


Input

5 3


Output

Masha


Input

2 3


Output

Equal

Note

Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the interval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. 

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction.

In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    assert a * b / func_1(a, b) == a / func_1(a, b) * b
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b

#Function 3:
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)

#Function 4:
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)

#Function 5:
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2

#Function 6:
def func_6(a, b):
    G = func_1(a, b)
    L = func_2(a, b)
    if a < b:
        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if D > M:
            return Ma
        else:
            return Da
    else:
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if D > M:
            return Ma
        else:
            return Da


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
