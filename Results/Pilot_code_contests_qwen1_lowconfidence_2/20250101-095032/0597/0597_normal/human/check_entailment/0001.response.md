Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_6` does not handle the scenario where two trains arrive simultaneously and Vasya chooses the direction with the lower frequency of trains. This function does not account for this rule, leading to incorrect behavior in certain cases.

For example, consider the input `3 7`. According to the problem description, if two trains arrive simultaneously, Vasya will choose the direction with the lower frequency of trains. However, the current implementation does not handle this situation properly. Let's analyze the behavior:

- If Vasya descends at time 0, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha) and time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descends at time 1, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha).
- If Vasya descents at time 2, he will catch the train at time 3 (to Dasha).
- If Vasya descents at time 3, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 4, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 5, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).
- If Vasya descents at time 6, he will catch the train at time 7 (to Masha).

From this, we can see that Vasya would go to Dasha more often in this case, not Masha as the program incorrectly suggests. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
