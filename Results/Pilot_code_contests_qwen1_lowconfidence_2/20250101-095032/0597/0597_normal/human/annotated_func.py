#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a_0` and `b_0`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a_0 and b_0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where `a` and `b` are distinct and within the range `[1, 10^6]`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the variable `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns `a` as the GCD. This process handles all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly computes the GCD. Edge cases, such as when `a` or `b` is 1, are properly handled by the algorithm. The function does not include any additional actions beyond computing the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that a ≠ b, and a * b / func_1(a, b) is an integer.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a / func_1(a, b) * b
    #The program returns (a / func_1(a, b) * b), given that a * b / func_1(a, b) is an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that `a ≠ b`. It calculates and returns the value of `(a / func_1(a, b) * b)`, provided that `a * b / func_1(a, b)` is an integer. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value that divides `a * b` evenly, the function will return a valid integer result. However, if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero or a value that does not divide `a * b` evenly, the function will raise a division by zero error or return a non-integer result, respectively. The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly, leaving the behavior undefined in such scenarios.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of two positive integers a and b where a ≠ b and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func_3(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_1(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to the two elements in the list `numbers`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `numbers` containing two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. It applies the function `func_1` to these two integers and returns the result. The function uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to sequentially apply `func_1` to the elements of the list. Since the list contains only two elements, the `reduce` function effectively calls `func_1` once with these two elements. There are no apparent edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not include any additional checks or conditions beyond the initial constraints on the input values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and the integers represent possible descent times for Vasya in minutes since the start of the train schedule.
def func_4(numbers):
    return reduce(lambda a, b: func_2(a, b), numbers)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first two elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, representing possible descent times for Vasya in minutes since the start of the train schedule. It returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first two elements. If the list contains fewer than two elements, an error or undefined behavior may occur due to the use of `reduce` without proper initialization or handling of empty lists. No additional postconditions are explicitly stated, but the final state of the program will be the result of the reduction operation applied to the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and represents the number of intervals within the period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
    #The program returns n * (n + 1) / 2, where n is an integer and represents the number of intervals within the period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of intervals within a period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. It calculates and returns the value of `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the provided logic is complete.

        M = (L / b - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M which is equal to ((L / b - 1) * G) and D which is equal to (L - M), where L is the result of func_2(a, b), G is the result of func_1(a, b), and a ≠ b.
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D which is less than or equal to M, where D is L - M and M is equal to (L / b - 1) * G
    else :
        M = (L / a - 1) * G
        D = L - M
        if (D > M) :
            return Ma
            #The program returns M which is calculated as (L / a - 1) * G, given that D is greater than M
        else :
            return Da
            #The program returns D * a, where D is G + L(1 - 1/a) and M is (L / a - 1) * G, with G being the result of func_1(a, b) and L being the result of func_2(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers representing the frequency of trains going to Masha's and Dasha's directions respectively, with the condition that `a ≠ b`. The function calculates and returns one of four possible values based on specific conditions involving the results of `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2(a, b)`.

- If `a < b`, the function calculates `M` as `((L / b - 1) * G)` and `D` as `(L - M)`, where `L` is the result of `func_2(a, b)` and `G` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. It then returns either `M` or `D` depending on whether `D` is greater than `M`.
- If `a >= b`, the function calculates `M` as `(L / a - 1) * G` and `D` as `(G + L(1 - 1/a))`. It returns either `M` or `D * a` depending on whether `D` is greater than `M`.

In all cases, the function ensures that the returned value is either `M` or `D` under specific conditions related to the relative sizes of `M` and `D`. If `D` is not greater than `M`, the function returns `D` in the first case and `D * a` in the second case.
