The function `func_5` accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of intervals within a period during which Vasya can descend into the subway, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. It calculates and returns the value of `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the provided logic is complete.
