The function `func_3` accepts a list `numbers` containing two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a ≠ b` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6`. It applies the function `func_1` to these two integers and returns the result. The function uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to sequentially apply `func_1` to the elements of the list. Since the list contains only two elements, the `reduce` function effectively calls `func_1` once with these two elements. There are no apparent edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not include any additional checks or conditions beyond the initial constraints on the input values.
