The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, where `a` and `b` are distinct and within the range `[1, 10^6]`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the variable `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns `a` as the GCD. This process handles all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly computes the GCD. Edge cases, such as when `a` or `b` is 1, are properly handled by the algorithm. The function does not include any additional actions beyond computing the GCD.
