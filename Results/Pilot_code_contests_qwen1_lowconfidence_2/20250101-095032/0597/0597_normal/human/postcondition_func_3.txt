The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `numbers`, representing possible descent times for Vasya in minutes since the start of the train schedule. It returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to all pairs of integers in the list `numbers` using the `reduce` function, starting with the first two elements. If the list contains fewer than two elements, an error or undefined behavior may occur due to the use of `reduce` without proper initialization or handling of empty lists. No additional postconditions are explicitly stated, but the final state of the program will be the result of the reduction operation applied to the list.
