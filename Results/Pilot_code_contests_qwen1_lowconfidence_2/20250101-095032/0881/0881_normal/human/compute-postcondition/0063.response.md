`c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c` is 0, so after the increment, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 3` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 2`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 2`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 1, `d` is `True`, `s` is either `'BGG'` or `'BBG'`, `i` is 2.**
