Postcondition: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, `s` is either `'BG'` or `'BB'`, `i` is 1. If `a < b`, then `c` remains 0. If `a >= b`, then `c` becomes 1 if it was 0 initially, or `k + 1` if it was `k` initially.**
