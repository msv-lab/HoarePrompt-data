The code sets the variable `c` to `0`. According to the initial state, `c` was either `0` initially or `k + 1` if it was originally `k`. Since `c` is now set to `0`, it means `c` was originally `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 2` if `a >= b` and `a` was originally `vals[2] - 1`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is `0`, `d` is `False`, `s` is `'BG'`**
