`c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` depends on the value of `k`, so after incrementing, `c` will be `k + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is `k + 1`, `d` is True, `s` is 'BB', `i` is 1**
