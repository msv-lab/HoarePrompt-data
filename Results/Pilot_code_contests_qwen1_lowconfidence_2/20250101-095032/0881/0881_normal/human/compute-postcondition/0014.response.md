The value of `c` is reassigned to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0**
