`a` is assigned the value `vals[2]`. The previous value of `a` was an integer such that `0 ≤ a ≤ n`. After assigning `a = vals[2]`, the value of `a` is now specifically `vals[2]`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and the value range constraints for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is vals[0]; `k` is vals[1]; `a` is vals[2]; `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ n and a + b = n**
