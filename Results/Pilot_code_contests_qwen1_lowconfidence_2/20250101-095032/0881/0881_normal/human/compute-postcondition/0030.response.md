`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `c` was previously `1`, so it is now `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is `0`, `d` is `True`, `s` is 'B', `i` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is `0`, `d` is `True`, `s` is 'B', `i` is `0`**
