The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state where `c` is 0, after this operation, `c` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 1, `d` is True, `s` is 'G', `i` is 0**
