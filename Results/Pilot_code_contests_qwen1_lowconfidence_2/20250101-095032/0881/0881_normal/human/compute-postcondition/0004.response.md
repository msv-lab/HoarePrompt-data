The value of `b` is assigned the value of `vals[3]`. Since `vals` is an array or list, `vals[3]` refers to a specific value. Given the precondition that `a + b = n` and `0 ≤ b ≤ n`, the new value of `b` must satisfy these conditions.

Let's assume the initial values are as follows (since they are not explicitly given in the problem statement):
- `n` is `vals[0]`
- `k` is `vals[1]`
- `a` is `vals[2]`

The value of `b` is now `vals[3]`. We need to ensure that `a + b = n` holds true. Therefore, if `vals[3]` is a valid value that satisfies `0 ≤ vals[3] ≤ n` and `a + vals[3] = n`, then the condition is met.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`; `k` is `vals[1]`; `a` is `vals[2]`; `b` is `vals[3]`**
