The code `quit()` does not affect any variables; it simply exits the current block of execution. Given that there is no further execution of the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` if `a >= b`, otherwise `a` is `vals[2]`; `b` is `vals[3] - 1` if `b >= a`, otherwise `b` is `vals[3]`; `c` is `0`; `d` is `False` if `a >= b` and `b >= a`, otherwise `d` is `False`; `s` is `'B'` if `a >= b`, otherwise `s` is `'B'`; `i` is `0`.**
